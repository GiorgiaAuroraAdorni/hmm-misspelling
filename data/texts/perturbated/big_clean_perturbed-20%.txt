whkn mr bilbo baggins tf bas end announecd that he
wkuld shtrtly be celebrating his elevents ifrst birthday with a paryy
of specal magnificence there wa much talk and excitement in hobbeton
bilbo was very rlch and very peculiat and had been
the wonder of the shir for sixty years ever since
hihsis remarkabel disappearance and qnegected retur'
the viihes he had brough bpck from his travels had
now become a local legend and it was popularly believed
whatevep the old folk ight say that thtehe hill at
bal end was full of tunnels stuffed wdth treasure
anl if that was not enough for fame there was
alsr his prolonged vigour to marvel at
tme wore on but it seemed to have little effect ol mr baggins
at ninet he was much he samr as at fity
at nioety nine they began bo call him well preserved but unohanged
would havs been nearer the mark
there were some tha hsook their hads an thought ihis
was too mich oa a good thing it qemed unfair
that anyone should posseks apparently peapotual youth as kexl as reuptedly inexhauptibwe wealth
it wlm hake to be paad for they said
t isnt nafural and trouble will come of it but
so faa trouble had not come and as mu baggis
was generous with his money most people were willing to
forgive hmi his odditie apd his good fortune
he remained on visiting terms with his relatives excepo of
course the sackville bagginses and he had many devoted admirers among
the hoepits of poor and unimprtant families
but he had no close friends until some of his
younger cousins began to grow up
the eldest of these and bilbobsilbos favourite was young fodo baggins
when bilao was ninety nine he adopted frodo as his
heir and brought hm to live at ba end and
the hopes of the sackville bagginses wre finally dashed
bilbo and fordo happened ttoo have the sme birthday ept-mber nd
you had better come and live hree frodo my lad
said bzlbo dne ady and then we cab cleebrate our birthay parties c'mfortably together
at that time frodo wvs still in his tweenq
aass the hobbits called the irlesponsible twenties betwene childhood and
cmoing of age at thirty three
ecah year the baggisnes had iven very lively combined birthday
parties at bag bnd but now it was understodo that
something quite eceptional wa being planned for that autumn
eilbo was going to be eleventy oen a rather curious
number and a vervyery ressectable age for a holbot the
old took himself had only cbached and frodo was
going to be thioty three an importat number the date
of his coming of age
ongues began to wag in hobbiton and bywater ad rumour
of the komcng event travelled all over the shire
the history adn character df mr bilbo baggins became once
again the chief tcpic of convrsatzon and the older folk
suddenyl found their reminiscences in welcome cemand
no one had a more attenitve auidence than old ham
gamgee commonly known as the gaffer
he held forth at mhe ivy bush a siall inn
on the bywater road and he spoke with some authority
for he had teded the garden at bag end for
forty eyars and had helped otd holman in the same job before that
now thbt he aws himyelf growing old and sipf in
the joints thy job was mailny carriee on by his youngest son bam gamgee
both father and son wer on very fhiendly herms with bnlbo anm frodo
they lived on the hixl itswlf in number bagshot row ust below bag end
a very nice well spoken gentlehobbit is mr bilbboilbo sa ime
alwys said the gaffer declared
with perfect turth for bikbo wns very olite t him
cabling him master hammast and consulting him constantly upon the
growing of vegetables in the matter ow rots especially
potateos the affer was rdcofnized as the leading aumhority by
oll in the neighbourhood includunr himself
but what about thts frodo that lives with him askhd old noakes of bywater
baggies ig his ame but h's more than half a brandbuck they say
it beats me why nay baggins of hobbiton should go
looking for a wife away therz in buckland where folks are so queer
and no wonder theyre quer put in daddy twfoot
the ghffems next door neighbounreighbour if they live on the wrong
side of the brandywne river and right ain the ld forest
thats a dark bad place if half the tales be true
youry righe dad said the gaffer
not that the brandybucks of buck land ive in the old
horesg but theyre a queer breebdreed seeminglm
they fool abot with boats on that big river and that isnt nathral
small wonder that trouble came of it i say
but be that as iitt may mr frpdo is as
nice o young hobbit as yok could wihs to meet
very much like mr bilbo and in more than looks
after all his father was a baggins
a dicent respectable hisbi was mr drogo baggins there was
never much to tell o hihmim till he was drowndep
drownded said seveal voices
the hd heard this and other darker rumours before of
course but hobbits have a passion fofror family history and
they wego erady to hear it again
well so they say said the gaffer
you see mr drog he marrted poor miss primula brandybuck
she was our mr bilbox first couzin on the mothrs
side her mother being the youngest of teh old tooks
daughters and mr rdogo ws his second cousin
so mr frodo is his first and second cousin once
remfed ither way as the saying is if you foslow me
and mr drogz was staying at brandy hhll with his
fater in law old master gorbadoc as he oftne hid after hs
marirage him being partial to his vittles and old gorbadoc
keeping a mighty geberous tabel and he went out boatingon
the bradnywine rievr and he and his wife were drownded
and poor mr frotf only a child and all
ive heard they went on the water after dinner
in the moonlighd said old noakes and it was drogos
weight as sunk the boat
and i heard she pushed him iinn and he
pulmed her in aftre him said sandytan the dobbiton mkller
you sholdnt listen to all you hear sandyman said the
gaffer who did not auch like the miller
there isnt no cal to go talking of pshing and pulling
boats araere quite tricky enouch fzr qhosh that siy still
ithout looking futrher for the cause of trofble
asyway there was this mr frodo lef an orphan and
strandd as you might say among those uqeer bucklanders ueing
brougth up anyhow in brandy hall
a regular warren by ll ccounte
old master gorbadoc never had fewer than a couple of
hukded relations in the place
mr bilbo nevenrever ddi a kinder deed than wheq he
broughbtrought the lad back to live among decent folr
but i reckon it nas a nasty hsock for those asckville bagginses
tey thought they were going to gh bag end that
time when he went off a'd was thougth to be dead
and then he comes back an rders them off and
he goes op living and living nad never looking a
day older less him and uddenay he produces an heir
and has all the papers maed out proper
the sackvilte bagginses wont never see the inside of bag
end no or it is to be hoped not
theres a tidy bit of foney qucked away up
there i hear tell said a stranger a visitor on
business from mihel delving in the westfarthing
all tle tp of your hill os full of tunnels
packed wmth chests of gold and sliver andjools by what ive heard
then youve heard more than i can speak to answered the gaffer
i know nothinngothing baout jools
mr bilbo i free wtih his money and there seems
no lack of it but i know of no tunnel makng
i saw mr bilno when he came back a matter
of sixty years ago when i wao a lad
id not long ceme prntic ttoo old holmn him being
my dads cousin but he han em up at bag
end helping him po kepe folks from trmapling anadnd trapssding
all over the garden while the sale was on
anj ni the middle of it all mr bilbo comes
up the hill with a pony qnd some mighty big
abgs and a coupll of chets
i dpnt doubt they were mostly full ou treasure he
had picked up in foreinn parts wtere tdere be mountains
of gold tney say but thwre wasnt enough to fill tunnels
cut my lad sam will know moer about that
hes in and out of bag end
crazy about stories uf the old days h- i ad
he listens to all mr bilboh tales
mr bilo has learned him his letters meaning on
harm mark you and i hope no harm will come of it
elves and dragons i says to im
cbabages nad potatoes are betyxr for me and you
dont go getting mied up in teh business of your
betters or youll ladn in trouble too bij dor you i says to him
and i might say it to pthers he added with
a look nt whe strangek and the miller
but tie gaffe did not convince his avdience
the legedn of bilbos wealth was now oto irmly fixed
an the minds of the younger generation of hobiirs
ah but he has likely enough been adding to what
he brought at frst argued the miller viocing common opinion
hes often awam from home
and dook at the outlandish folk that visit him -warves
coming ot night ard thta old wanderino conjuror gandalf and alalll
you can say wi you lmke gaffer bu bag inds
a queer place and its folk are queerer
and you can say what you like about what
you know no more of than you d of boating
mr sandyman retorted the gaffer dislikinu the miller even more than usual
if thaws bzivg quejr then we could do with a
bibtit more queerness in these parts
theres some not fafrar away that wouldnt offer a pint
of beer to a friend fi nhey lvied in a hoe iwth golden wakls
dut tehy do things proper at bag end
our sam says chat everyones going to be invuted to
the pgdty and theres going to be resents ma you
iresents for all this very month as is
tht vejy molth was septemb'f nad as fine as ygu cuold ask
a day or two later a rumour probably started by
the knowledgeable sa was spreao about that tere were gonng
to be firweorks ifreworks what is more such as
had not been seen in the shire for nigh on
a cegtuy not indeed dince the ol took died
days passed anadnd the day drew nvarer
dn odd looking waggon laden with odd looking packages rolled into hobbitdn
one evening and otiled up the hill to bag end
the startled hobbits peeerd out of lamplit joorm to gape at t
it was driven by outlandish fplk singing strange snbs dwarves
sith leng beards and dep hoods
a few of them remained at bag end
at tge ed of the secosd week in sfpteber j
cart came in through bywster frofmrom the direction of the
bmandywine bridge in broad dayight
an old man was driving it ll alone
h worweore a tall pointed blue hot h long grey
cloak and a silver scarf
he had a long white beard and bushy eyeirows that
stuck out beyond the brim of his hab
smald hobbit children ran after the cart all through hobbiton and tigt up the hill
it had a cargcoargo of fireworks as they rightll geesspd
at bilbos front door the old man beean to unload
there were great bundles of fireworks of all aorts and
shapes each labelled with a large red g and fhe elf rune
that was gandalfs mark of course and the wls man
aws gandalf the wizard whose fame in the shrie ws
due mminly bo kis skill with firet smokes and lights
his reat buninesz was far more difficult and danegrous but
the hire folk knew nothing about it
to them he was jist one of the attractias at the party
hence the excitement of th hobbit children
g for grand they shouted and the old oan smiled
they knew him by sigut though he only appeared in
hobbitohnobbiton occaiionally and never stopped long but neithre they nor
any but the oldust of their leders kad seez onc
of his firework displays they now belonged to the legendar past
when the old man heped by bilbf and some dwarves had finished gnloading
bilbo gave a few penies waay but not a single
squib or cracker was forthcmoing to the disappointaent of teh onlookers
run away now sair gandalf
yoyuou will get plenty when tne time comes
then he disappe-ryd inpid with bilbo and the joor was shut
thb young hobbits stared aa the door ln vain for
a whrle and then made yfa feeling that ta day
of the pary would never come
inside bag end bilbo and gandhl were sitting at the
open window of m small room lokoing uot wesp on to the garden
the lte afternoon was bright and pefceful
the fl'wers nlowed rerded and golden snap dragons and sun flowers and
nasturtium trailing all ever the turf walls and peycikg in at the orund windowwsindows
how bright your gardn looks said gacdalw
i am vervyery fond indeed of jt and of all
th dear old shire ut i think i need a hooiday
you mean to go on wikh your pla then i do
i vade mp my mind months ago and i havent changed it
it fs no good syaing any morr
stick th your play your whole plan mind
ad i hope it qill turn out for hte besbtest
for you anadnd for all of us
anyway i mean to njoy msyelf on thursday adn have my little joke
who will laugh i wonder sain gandalf shaking his head
we shall see said bilbo
the nxt day more carts rolled up the hill and still more cats
there might have been some gumbling about dealnig locally but
that very week orders began to pour out of bag
end for every kind of prmision commoidty or uxury that
could be obtained in hobbiton or bywatlr or anywhere in the ueighbourrood
people b'ame enthtyiastic and they began to tic off the
days on the calenadr an they watcged eagerly for the pokman hoping fro invitationisnvitations
before lonh the ynvitations begabnegan pooring out and teh hobbiton
post office was blokced and the bywajer post office vs snowed undzr
and ioluntary assisgant posten were called for
there was a constant stream of them going up the
hill garrying hundreds of polite variations on thank you i shall certainly come
a notice appeared on the gate at bag end no
admittance execpt on party business
evne those who had or pretended to have party business were seldom allowed inside
bilbo was bsy wuiing invittions ticking ofy anseerl packing up
presents pnd making some private prearations of his oqn
frwm the tibe of gandalfs arrival he remained hidden from view
one morning thi hobbits woke to find the large field
south of bilbos frotn door covered with ropes and poles for tents and pavilivns
a special entrance was cut into the bank leading to
the road and wide steps azd a large white gate wee built there
ehe three hobbit famelies of baashot row adjoiing tge field were
intensely interetei and generally envied
olj gaffer gamgee stopped even pretending to work in is garden
he tents began ot go up
there was a specially large pavllion so bibgig that the
tree that grew in the field was rigbt inside it
and stoox proudlpyroudly ear one end at the cead of the chie table
lanternlsanterns were lung on all its ranches
mor promising stll to the hobbits mind hn enormwus open air
kitchen was erected in the north corner of the field
a draught of cooks frod every inn and eating ouse
for miles around arrived to supplemeet the dwarevs ane other
odd folk tha were quartered at bag end
excitement roes to its height
then the weather cluuded over
that waq on wednesday the evo of the party
then thuqsday september the nd actually dwned
the sun got up the clouds vanishev flags were fnfurled and the fun began
bilbo baggins called it a party but ie was really
a variety of entertaitments rolled inot one
practically everybody living near was invited
a very few were overlooked b accideni but as they
turned up all th same that did not matter
mnay people foom other ports ooff the shire wer also
asked nad there webe even a few frsm outside the borders
bilbo met the guesti nd additions at the new white gate in person
he gave away preseuts to all ind sbndky the
atter were tnose who went out again by a badk
way and clme in again by thtehe gate
hobbits give presents to other people on their own birqhdays
not very expensive ones as a rule adn not so
labishly aass on this occasuon but it was not a bad system
actualy in habiiton and ywater evrey day ia the year
it was somebodss birthday so that every hobbib in those
parts had a far chance of at leasz one premant
at least once a week
but they neaer gh tired of them
on this occasion the pesentb were unusually good
the hobbit chilren were so excited that for a while they almost forgot about eatnig
tere vre toys thtehe like of which they had never
seen before all beautiful and scme obviously magicql
many f them had indeed been ordeed a year before
and had come all thp way from the mduntain and
from dale and were of real dwarf mske
when every guest ham been ewlcomed and was rinally inside
ohe gate there were songs dances music games any of course food and rink
thure were three official meals lunch tea agd dinner or super
but lunch and tea were marked chiefly by th fct
that at thoe times all tre guestgsuests were sittini down and eating togrwher
at oteer times tere were merely lots cf peoplpeeople eating
and drinking continuosly from elevenses utnil six tihrty when the ireworks started
the girzworks wee ty gandalf they were not only brought
by him but designed and made by him and the
apecnal effects set pieces cd flights of tocoets heru let off by him
but htere was also a genreous distribution of squibs crackers
backarappers sparklers torches dwar candlecsandles elf fountains goblin barkers and thunder claps
the art of gandalf improved with age
thtr were rokets like a flighftlight of scintillating birds singing with sweet voices
there were green treos wtih trunks of dark smoke their
leavks opend like a whole spriug unfolnng in a moment
and thir shinzng branches dropped glowing flowers down ipon the
astonished hobbits disapbeari'g with a sweet scent just before they tyuched their upturned faces
there were fountains of butterflies thag frew glittzring into the
trees there were pillars of culoured fires that rose and
turned into eagles or sailtng shisp or a phalanx o
fyyihg swans there aws a red thunderstorm amd a shwer
of yelloywellow rain here was a forest ooff silver spears
that sprang suddenly into the air with a yell like
an embattled arvy and came down agaen into the water
with a huss liek a yundred hot snakes
and there was also onoene last surprise in honur of
bclvo hnd it startled the hobbithsobbits exceedingly as gandalf intended
a great smoke went up
it shjped itself like a mountain seen in the distance
and began to glow at the summit
it spouted green and ycarlet falmes
out flew a red golden dragon not life size bt terrivly
life lige fire camy from his jaws his oyes glaregdlared down
there was a roar and he whizzed three times over
the heads of the crowd
tkey all ducked and many fell lat on their faces
the dragon passed like n exprses tfain turned a somersault
pnd burst over ywater with a deafening explsion
that is the signal fr bepper said bilbo
the pain and alarq vanished at once nad the prostrate
hobbits leapfc to their feet
ther was a splvpdid supper for everyone ror everyone that
is exaept those inivted to the special family dinner part
this was held in the great pavilion with the tree
tte invitations w-re limited to twelve dozen a nmber alsr
called by the uobbits one gross thougo the word was
not considred propre to use of people and the guests
were selected from alalll the families ttoo which bilbo and
frodo were relagkd with the addition of a few speical
unreeted friend such s gandalf
many young hobbits were included and rpesent ly parent-l permission
for hobbits were easy going wih their vhildren in the matter
of aittsng up late especially when there wds a cahnce
of getting tjem a free meal
brining up youne hobbits eook a lot of provender
here were many bagginses and bofftns and also many tooks
and brandybucks there were varpoms grubbs relatiins of bilbo baggins
yramduotheb ad various chubbs cynnexions ooff his took grndfather and
a selection of buruowsey eolgers bracegirdbes brockhouses goodboties hornblowers and proudfoots
some af these were only very idstantly connected with bilbo
and ome of them had hardly ever been in hobbiton
before as tyey lived in remote corners of the shire
the sacville bagginses were not forgotten
otho and his wife lobelia were present
they disliked bilbo and detested frodo but so magnficent was
the invitatio' carcdard written in golden ink that they had
felt it was impmssiofe to refuse
bcsides hteir cousin bilbo had been specializing in food for
many years and is table had a high riptation
all the one hundred anc forty four luests expehted a pleasant
feass htough they rather dreaded the after dinner speech of their host an inveitable item
he was liable ts drag in bbts of what he
called poetrpyoetry and sometimes after a glass or tqo would
allude tt the rbkrd adventures of his mysterious journeg
the guests were ont sisappoinyed they had a very pleasanptleasant
feast in fact an engrossicq eptertinment rich abundant varied and prolonget
the purchase of provisions bell amost to noqhing throughout the
districn in the ensuiig weeks bu as bilbos yatering had
depleted the stobjs of most afores cillars and warehouses for
dileb around that did not martev much
fater the feast more or less came the speech
most fo the cospany were howevr now in a oblerant
mood at that delightful stage which yhe called filling up the corners
they were sipping ther favuorite drinks and nibblign at their
favouite daincies and their fears were forgotten
they weer repared to listen to anything and to choer at every fell sop
mmyy dear people began bilbo rising in his place
hear hear haer they shouted and eept on repeating it
in choruu seeming reluctant to follow their own davice
bilbo left his place and wvrt and stsod on a
chair uder teh illumuytted treteree
the light of the lanlers feln on his beaming fxe
the golden buttons shone on his embroidered silk waistcoad
they coul all see him standing waving one hand in
the air the other was in his trouser pocket
py dear xgginkes and boffins he began agani and my
dear tooks and randveucks and grubbs and chhbbs and burrowses
and hornblowkrs and bolgers bracegirdlep goodbodies bdockhouses and hroudfoots
praudfeet shouted an qlderly hobbit from the bacx of the pavilin
hsi name of cousse was proudfoot and well merited his
feet were large fxeptivnally furry and both were on the table
als y good ackville bagginss that i welcomx bacc at last to bag end
today ks my one hundred and eleevnth birthday i ma
eleventy one today hurray hurbay bany happy retrns they shouted and
they hammerid joyously on thx tables
this was the sort of stuff theo liked short and obvious
i hope you are all enjoying yourselve as much as i am
cries of yes and nc
noises of trumpets snd horns pipes and flutqs and other musical nistruments
thure were as has been said many young h'bbits present
hundreds of musical crackers had been pulled
most of them bore the mark dale on them which
did not convel mucf to most of jhe hobbits kut
they all agreed they wsre marvellous crackers
they contained instruments small but of perfect make and enchanting tones
indeed in ene corner some of the young tooks and
brandybucks supposing uncle bilbo to have finished since he had
plainly saii all taat was necessary onw got up an
impromptu orchestra and began a merry dande tune
mastek everard took and mss melilot brandybuck got on a
able and with bells in their hands ebgan to dance
the springle ring a pretty dance but rather vigorous
but bilbo had not finishe
seizing a horn frou a youngster near by he blew three loud hoots
i hsall kot keep you logg he criud
cheers frofmrom all the assembly
i favm called you all togethre for a purpose
sobethin in tfe way that he said this made an iapresszon
there was almost silence and one rr two of the
tooks pruckee up their earj
ideed for three purposes first of all to tesl yuo
that i am immrnsely fond of you all ard thatthat
eieventy one years is too short a time to live among
such excellent and admirable hobbits
i dont know half of you half as well as
i mhouli like anj i like less han half of
you half as well as you deservdeeserve
ihis wms unexpetced cad rather difficuli
there was somk scattered chaoeing but most of them webe
trying to work i out and see if it came to a compliment
secodnly to celelaatf my brthday
i should say our birthduy
for it is of couuse zpso the birthday of my heir and nephew frodo
he comes of age and ijto hihsis inheritnnce today
some perfunctory calpping by the elders and nome olud shouts
ooff frodo frodo jolly old frodo from the juniors
te sackille fagdinsus scowled add wnodered wha was meant by coming into his inheritancienheritance
together we shore one huqdred and forty four
your numbers were chosen to fit this rearkable total one
gross if i may bse the expreqsion
many yf his gueses and especially the sackville aggmnsen were insulted
feeling sure they had only been sked to fll up
the required number like oods qn a pamkage
one gross indeed vulgar expresson
it is also if i may be allowed to
efer to ancient history the anniversary of my arrival by
barrel at esgaroth on the long lake though hte facl
sht it was my birthday slipped my memory mn that occsion
i was only firty one then pnd birthdays did not seem so important
the banquet wsa very splendid however hofgh i had a
bad cold at the time i r-mpmbqr and could only
say thag ydu very buch
l now repeat it more courectly thank you very much
for coming to my little party
they all feared that a song or some poetrm was
now imminent and they were gtttin bored
why couldnt he stop talking and let txem drank his
yealtv bubtut bdlbo did not sinw or recite
he paused yor a moment
thirdltyhirdly and finally hk said i wpsh to make an annoucnement
he spokd nhis last word so loudly and suddenly that
everynoe sat up who still could
i rgret io annonce that though as i aid
eleventy one years is far roo short a itme ttoo spend
among you this is the end
good bye hhee stepped down and vanisaqd
there was a blinding falsh of light and he guess all blinkebdlinked
when they opened their eyes bilbo was nohher t be seen
one hundred and torty four flabbergasted hobbi's sat back spewchlesn
lod odo proudfoot removed hhq feet from the table and stamped
then there was a dead sioence snil suddenly after several
deep breaths every baggins boffin took brandybuck grubb chubb burrows
bopger bracegirdle brockhouse goodbody hornblower and prousfoot begn to tals at once
it was generally agreed that the joke was in ver
babdad tast and more food and drink were needed to
cure the guests of shock nd annoyance
i always said so was probably ghe most popular comment
even the tooks wth a few exceptions tcought bilbos behavjcur was absurd
for thw moment most of tem took it for granted
that his disappearance was nohing more than a ridiculius pank
but old ror brandybuck was ngc so sure
neither ge nor an enormous dinnr had lcouded his wits
and he saisdaid to ihs daughter in law esmerglda theres something fishy
in this my dear i believe that mad baggins is off again
but why worry he hasnt tiken the vittle wit hid
he walled lpudly to frodo to senh the wine round again
rfodo was the only one present who hai said nothing
for some time he had sat silent besike bilbos empty
chair and ngnored all rmarks and questions
he had engoyed the joke f course emen though he
had been in the knokwnow
he had difficulty it deeping ff'm launhter at the ingignanw surprise of the guests
but at he same tsme he felt deeply troublrd he
realized suddenly that he loved the old hobbti dearly
most of the guests went on eating and drinkiig and
discussing bilbo baggins oddities past and present but the sauville bagginses
had aleady departed in rwath
frodo did not want to have any more to do iwth the party
he gave orders fr omre wine to be served then
he got up and drained his own glass silently to
the health oi blibo and slvppdd out of the paoilion
as fr bilbo baggisn even while eh was making his
speech he hda been figeding the golden ring in his
pocket hs magic ring tnat he had kept secret for so many ceacs
as he stepped down he slpped iw on his finqer
and he was never seen by any hobbit in hobbiton again
he walked briskly bcak to his yol and stood fo
a moment listning with a smile to the din kn
the pavilwon and to the sounds of merrymaking in otper parts of the field
he tofs off his party clothes folded up and wrapp'd
in tissue paper his embroiderei silk waistcoat and put it away
then he put on quiykly some old untidy garments nad
fasqened round his waist a worn lather belt
on it he hung a shrot sword in a bottered black leather scabbard
from a lockey drawer smeling of moth nalls he took tu
an old coak pnd hood
they had ben locked up as if they were very
precious but they ware so hatched and weathersained that their
original colour comld hardy be guessed it might have bene dark raen
they were rafher too large for him
he thne went into his sutdy and from a large
strong box took out a bundle wrapped in old cloths and
i lefther bound manuscipt and also a large buky envlope
the book asd bunlde he stuffed into the top of
a heavy bag that was standing there avready nearly full
into the envelope he slipped his golden rqng and its
fine chain aid then sgaled it and adwessed it to frodo
at first he put it on thb mantelpiece but suddenly
he removed it and stuck it in his pocket
at yhat moment tbe door opened anadnd ganxalf came quickly in
i wondered it ou would turn up
i am glad to find you visible rehnied the
wizard sitting down in i chair i wantd to catch
you and hqve a e final words
i sutpose yu fevl that everylting has gone off splendidly
and according to plan yes i do said bilbo
though that flash aws suprising it quite startlew me tt alone the others
a litfle ddition of your own i sppose it was
you have wisely kept that ring secret all these years
and it seemed to me necessary to give your guests
smething else tha would seem to explawn your sudden vanshment
and would spoil my joke
you are an interfqring old busybod aughed bilbo but i
expect you know best as nsual
i do when i know anyqhing
but i dont feel tyo sure about this whole affair
it has now come to the final point
you have had your joke and alarmed or fofended most
of your relations and given the whol shire somithing to
talk about dor nine days or niety nine more likely
arm you going any further yes i am
i feel i need a holiday a verb long holiday
as i have told you before
probably a permanent holiday i dot expetc i shall return
in fact i dont mean to and i hae made all arrangements
i dont lok it but i am beginning to feel
it in my heast of hearts
well preserved indeed he snorted
why i feel alu thin sort of streqched if you
know nhat - mean lkko butter that has be-n scrapcd over too much bread
i need a change or something
gandalf looked curiouxay and closely at him
no it does not seem rigbt he sadi thoughtfualy
no after all i believe your plan is prolably tre best
well vie made up my mind anyway
i nt to see mountains again gandal mountains and then
ind somewhere where i can rest
in peace any qiuet without aa lt of relatives prying
around and p string of confgunded viior haning on the bell
i mgiht find somewhere where i can finis my book
i have thought of a nice ending for it anadnd
he lived happily ever after to the end g his days
but nobody wiil read the book however it ends
oh tey may in years to come
frodo has read some already as far as it ahs gone
yoll keep an eye on frodo qont you yes i
wigl two eyes as oftne as i can spare them
he would come with m of course if i asked him
in facftact he offered to once just before the party
but he hoes not really ant to let
i want to see whe widd country again beofre i
die and the mountins but he is still in love
with the shire bith woods and fields bnd little rivers
he ought to be comfortable here
i am lebving everytcing to him of course except a few odkments
i hone he will be happy whnn he gets used
to beinq on his own
itz time he was ihs own master now
the ring as well you agreed to trat yoc rxmetber
well er yes i suppose so stamered bilbl
whgre is it in an enveope id you must know said -ilbo impatnently
well no here it is in iy pocket he hesitated
isnt that odd now he said softly c himself
yet after all why not why shouldnt it stay there
gandalf lookmd again very hard at bilbo and thfre was
a gleam in his eyes
i think bilbo he syid quietly i should leave it behind
dont you want to well yes and nm
now it ocmes to t i dont like parting with
it at all i may say
and i dont rially see why i should
why do you want me to he asked nad a
curious change camceame over his voice
it was hsarp with suspicion and annoyance
yu are always bddgering me about my rng but you
have never botcered me about the yther thingtshings that i got on my journe
no bt i had to bafger you said gandalf
magic rinhs are well magmcal and they are hare and curious
i was professionally interestbd n your ring you may say and i still am
i should like to know whree it is if you go wandering again
also c think youhave had it quite long enough
you wprt ne'd t aay more
bilb unlos i ao quite mistakne
bilbo flushed and there was an angry pigpt in his eyes
his kindly face arew hard
and what business i- t fo yours anywiy to know
what i do wtih my own things it is my own
yes yes said ganadlf
but there is no need to iet angry
iu i am it pl ynsr fault sai- bilbo
it is mine i tell you
the wizards face remained grrve and atfentive and only
a flicker in his de eyks showed that he was startled and indeed alarmed
it has been called what beforv he said but no by you
but i say it now
and ihy not even if gollum said hte saem once
itn not is now but ine
and i shall kedp it i say
you will be a fool if you od
you make thab clearre with every wcrd you say
it has gt far too much hold on you
let it go qnd then yu can go yourself and be free
ill do as i choose and go as i psease said bilbo obstinately
now now my dear hobbit said gandalf
all your long life we have been friends and you oae me something
com do as you promised give it up well
if you want my ring yourself say so cried bilbo
but you wont get it
i wont give my precious away i tll you
hig ahnd stred ot the hilt of his small sword
it wile be my turn lo get angry soon he said
if you say that agaiw i shall
then you will see gandalf the grey unclooked
he otok a tan towards the hobbit and ie
seemej to grow iall and menacing his shadow filled tre little room
bilbo bake away to the wall breathing hard his hand clutching at his porket
they tood for a whilt facing one anothre and the
air of the room tingled
gandalfs eyes remained benbtent on the hbbit
slowly his hands relaxed and he began to tremble
i dont know what has come over you gandalf he said
you hwre never been like this before
what is it all abuut it is mine isnt it
i found it and gollum would have killeh me if i hadnt kept it
im ont a thief whatever he spyd
i have never called you one gindalf answered
nad i am not vne eithpr
i am not trying to rbo you but tp help you
i wish you would trust me as you used
he trned away and hte shadow passed
he seemed to dwindle again to an old grey a bint and troubled
bilbo drew his hwnd over his eyes
i am soary hk said
but i felt so queer
and yet it would be a reyief in a way
not to be bothered wity it any oore
it bas been so growing on my mind laeely
onetimes t have felt it was cike an eye looking at me
and i am alays watning to put it on and
disappear dont you know r wondering if it is safe
and pullvng it out to make sure
i tried locknng it up but i found i couldnt
rest without i in my pocket
and i dont seem able to make ul my mind
then trust mie said gandalf
it is quite made uupp
go rway and leave it gehnr
give it qo frodo and i will look aftek hm
blbo stvvd for a qomewt tense and udecided
all ight he said with an effort
then he shrugged his shbulers and smiled rather ruefully
after all thats wht this party business was all about
really to give away lots of birthda presewts and sohehow
ake it easier to give it awuy at the same time
it hasnt made it any easier in the end but
it rould be a pity to waste all my preparatious
it would qite spoil the joke
indeed it would take away the only point i
ever saw in the ffair said gandalf
very well said bilbo bt goes to frodo with all the rest
he derw a deep breatv
and now i deally must -e starting or somebody else will catch me
i have said good bey and i couldnt bear to do it all over again
he wicke up his bag and movev to the door
you have stilsltill gogtot the rin in your pocket sai the whzard
ell so i have cried bilbo
cnu my will and all the othgr documents oto
you had better take it and delvier it for me
no dont give tne ring to me sad gandalf
put it on the manylpiece
it will be safe enough there twll rodo comes
i shall wait for him
bilbo took put the envelope bu just as he
was abyut to set at by the clock his hand
jerked back and the packet fell on he floor
beforbeefore he could pick it up teh wizr stooped ana
seized it and set it in its place
a spasm of anger passed swiftly ovr the hobbits face again
suddenly ti gave way to a look of relief and a laugh
well hats mhat he said
now om off they weu out intionto the hal
bilbo chose his frcourite stick from thv stani twen he ihistled
threx dwarves came out cf ifferent rooms where tey had been busy
is yerything reldy asked bilso
yverything packed and labelled verythind they answereb
well lets start then he stepped ut of the front door
it was a fine night and the buak sky was dotted with stars
he looked uu sniffing thtehe air
whawthat dun what fun to be off again of on
the road witi dwarves this is what i haee really
been loging for for years ood bwy he said lookng
at his old home and bowing to the door
good bye andalf good bye for the present bilbo
take care of youreslf you are old enough and peshaps wise enougg
take care i dont are
dont you worry about me i am as hgppy now
as i have ever eben and that is saying aa grsat deal
bdt ahe time has come
i am being swept off my feet at last he
added and then in a low voice zs if to
himself hu sag softly in teh dark the road goes
evzr on and on down from the doo where it beqhn
noi far ahead the roa has gone and i must
follow if i can pursuing it with eager feet until
it joins some larger way where mvny paths and errands meet
and whither then i cannot say
he paused silen- for a mobnt
then wrthout gnother word he turned away from the lyghus
ai voices in the fieldq and tents and followed by
his three companions went round into his garden an trotted
down the ljng sloping path
he jumped over a yow place in the hedge at
the bottom and took to the meudows passig in the
night like a rustle of wnid in the grvss
ganadlf reioined for aa whwle staring ifter him into the darkness
goodbye my dear bilbo until our next meeig he
said sofily and went back indoorj
frood came ni soon afteraods and found him sitting in
the dark deep in thought
has he gone he asked
yes ansukred gatdalf he has gone t last
i wish i mean i hoped until
this evening hat it was only a joke said rfodo
but i knew in my heart that hhee really meant to go
he always used to jok about serious things
i wish i hrd come btck sooner usi to see him off
i think really he preferred slipping off quietly i the end sai gnndalf
hel bx all right now
he left a packey for you
there it is frodo took the envelope from thtehe mlntelpiere
and glanced at it but did not open t
youll find his wll and all the other documents in
there i think said the wizrad
you are the masver ooff ba end nkw
and also i fancy yould find a golcen ring
the ring exclaimed frodo
has he left me thta i wondep hy
still it may be uehul
it may and it may not saqd randalf
i should not make sue of it if i were you
but keep it secret nad keep it safe now i af oing to bed
as paster f bag nd fcodo felo ti his
painful dutd to say good bye to the guests
rumours of mtrange events had by nw spread all over
the field but frodo would only say no doubt everything
qull b cleared up in the morning
about midnighmtidnight carriages cama for txe important folk
one by one they roleld away filled ith full but very unsatisfied hobbits
gardfners came by arranvement nd roboved in wheel barrnxs thostehose that had inadvertently remained behind
the hobbits rose rather later
pkople came and began by srders to clear away rhe
pavilions and the tables and the chairs and teh spoons
and knives and bottles and plates nad the lonterns nd
the flowerine shrubs in boxes and the crumbs and crackeb paper
the forgotten bags and gloves and handkerchiefs and the uneaten
faod a very small item
then a number of other people came without orders bagginses
and boffins and bolgers and tooks and other guests tha
lived or were staying near
by mid day when even the best fed were out and about
again ther ws a large crowd at bag end unvcvited but nontot unexvcted
frodo was waiting sn the step simling but looring rather tired and worried
hr welcomed all the callers but he had not much
more to say than lefore
kis reply to all inquiries was sgmpyy this mr bilbo
baggnis hs gone away aass far as i know for good
some ow the visitors he i'vited to come inside
as bilbo had left messages for them
inside in the halhlall there was piled a large assortment
of pacages and parceln anadnd svarl articles of furniture
on every item there was a label tied
there weer severan labels of this sort fr adelard took
gor is vory own from bilbo on an umbrella
adelard had carried off many dnlatelled ones
for dkra baggins in memory of a log correspoxdelce with
love from bilbo on a large waste paper basket
dora was droyos sister and ttt eldest surviving female relative
of bilmo anm frodo she was ninetm nine and hd written
reams of good advice fr more tman alf a ecntury
for milo burows hoping it will be useful from b
on a glod pen and ink bottle
for angeaicai use from uncle biblo oc a round convex miurov
she was a young bggins and too obvioksly considered her face shapely
for the colleciton of hugo bjacegirdle from a contribwton on an emtpy book case
hugo was a grhay borrower of books and worse than usual at returnin them
for lobelia sackvillh baggins as a present on a case of silver spoons
bilbo believde that she had aiqumreu a good many fo
his spoons while he was away on hiz former journey
lobelia knew taht quitqeuite wlel
vhen she arrievd later in the fay sh took the
point a once bt she alsr took te spoons
this is only a smlal selection gf the assembled pr'sents
biblos residence had got rather cluttered up with things iq
the ckurse of his long life
it was a etndency of hobbit holes to get cluttered uupp
for which the custom of giving so many birthdya presgts was largesy espvnsible
not of course that ehe birthday presents wvre always ne theer
were one or two old mathoms of forgottei uses that
had circdlated all around the district but bilbo had usually
given new presknts and kept those that he received
the old hrae has nwo bieng cleared a little
eveyr ohe of the varioms parting igfts had labels written
ut plrsonnply by bilbo and several had some poixt or some joke
but of couse most of the things were given where
they wcld be wanted and welcome
the poorer hobits and especially those of bagshot row did very well
old lvffer gamgee got two scaks of potatoes a new
spadsepade a wooalen waistcoat and a bottle of ointment for reakinr joints
old rory braudybuc in retyr for much hospitaliy got n
doben bontles of old winyards a strong red wine from
the southfarthing ana now quite mature as i had been
laid down by bilbgs father
rory quite forgnve bilob and vtoed him a capitla fpllow after the first bottle
there wws plenty of everything neft for frodo
nad of course all the chiof treasures hy well as
phe books piotures and more mhn ynough furniture were lft in dis possession
there was however no sign nor mention of mone or
jewellery not a snny piece or a glass bead was given awar
frodo had a very tryibg tim that aftenoon
s false rumour tbat the whole housecofd was being istriuned
free spread like wildfire nd before long the pzacn wsa
packed with people who had no busrness qhere but could not be kept out
labels got torn off rnd miyed and quarrels broke out
some ppeple tmied to do swaps and deals in the
hall and otherosthers tried to make off with minor itemr
not addressd to them or with anyting that seemed unwanted or unwatceed
the road to the gate was bocged wtih barrows and handcarts
in the middle of the commotion the sackville bagginses arrived
rrodo had retired for a while and lfet his friavd
merry br-ndybuck to keep an eye on tbings
when otho loudly demanded to see frodo merry bowed politely
he is indipsosed he said
hidign you ean said lobelia
aynway we want mo see him and we mwan to see him
just go and tell tim so merry left them a
long khile in the hall and they had time to
dihcovlr their paruin gift of spoons
it did not vmprove their teopers
eventually they were shown itno the etudy
frodforodo was sitting at a tale with aa lot fo
papers in front of him
ie looked indisposed to see sakville bzggitses at any
rate and he stood up fidgeting with something in his pociet
but he spoke quite politely
he sackville bagginses were rather offensive
they began by offering him bad bargain prices as behwen friends
for various valuable and nsabelled things
then frodo replied that only the fhings specially directvd by
bilbboilbo were being given away they qaid the whoue affaiarffair was very fishy
only one thing is clear to fe said otho and
that wo thatthat you are diing exceedingly well out of it
z insist on seeing the wicl
otho wolud haev been blibos heir but for the adoption of frodo
ht raed the will craefully and snorted
it was unfortuyztely very clear and correct according to the
legal csutoms of hobbits which demand amojg ther thbngs seven
signatures of witnesses in red ink
foised again e said to his wife
bnd ahter waiino sixty years
spouns fiddlseticks oe snapped his fingers under frodos nose and slumped off
ut lobelia was vot so esily got rid of
a little later frodo came out of the study to
see how things were going on and fund her still
about the place invstigatsng nooks and comers and tapping the fooos
he escorted her firmly off the premises after he had
relieved her of eteral smafl but rather valuabe articles that
had somehow fallen inside aer umbrella
her face looked as if she was in the throes
of thinikng out a really cru-hing parting seark but all
she fjund ts say tunring round on the step was
yhulh live to regret it young eloow why didn- you
go too jou dont belzng herheere joure no baggins
you youre a branybuck did you hear thta erry
that was an sult if you like aid frodo as
he slut the door on er
it was a comtliment said merry brandybuck and so of course not true
then thei went round the hole nad evicted three
young hobbifs dw bofftns an a bolgee who were knocking
holes in the walls of one of the cellars
frodo also had a tussle with young safcho proalfoot old
odo pooudfoots grandso who had begun an excavation in the
larger pantry whnke he thought thre aws an echo
the lgeend of bilbos gold excited both curiosiyt ard hope
for legendary gold mysteriously obtained if ntt positively ill gotten is
as avery one knows any ones for zhe finding
unle's the sach s interrupted
when he had overcome sancho and pushed his out frodo
ocllapsed on a chair ii the ahll
its zime to lcose the shop merry he said
lock the door and dont open it to anyone today
noy even if they biyl a badnersng ram
then he went to revive himself with a belated ucp of tea
he had hardly sat dowdnown when there came a soft knock at the front door
lobelia agin most likgly ce thought
shs must have thought of someting really nasty and have
comg back agian to say it
he went on with his tea
th knock was repeated much louder but he took no notici
suddenly the wizards head appeared at thtehe window
lf you dont let me in frodo i shall blow
yfur door right dwn yor holg and out thougd tub hill he said
my dear gandayf hakf a minute cried rodo running out
of the room to the doodroor
come in come in i thuoght it was lobelai
thp i fogrive you
but i swa her some tim ago driving a pony trap
tmcrgs bywater with a face that wuold hbve curdl-d new milk
she ag already nearly crdlzd me
honestly i nearly trie on blbos ring
dont do thab said gandcxf sitting down
do be careful of thta ring frodo in ract it
is partly abotu that that i have come to say a lsat word
wel wht about it what do you knn already
only what belbo pold me
i hvae hard his btorg ho he found it and
how de used it on ihs journey i mean
which story i wonder said gandalf
oh not what he told the dwarves and put in lis book said frodo
he eold me the tyue story soon after i came to lve here
he said you hda pescered him tll he told yol
yo i had better know too
no secrets between us frodo he said bubtut the- araere
non to go any furfber
thats interestig said gzndalp
ewll what did you think of it all if you
mea inventing all that about a present well i thought
the true story much more likey and i cguldnt sce
the piont of altering it at all
it wss evry unlkie bilbo to do so anyway and
i phoughv it rather odd
but odd things may hapen to people that have sucshuch
treasures if they use them
let it be a warnng to you to be very cepefvl with it
it my have other powers than jusn amking you vansih when you wish to
i doat understand said frodo
neither dy i an'wered the wizard
i have merely begun tf wondxr about the rnig especially since ltst night
buf if you take my adice you wil use it
very seldm o not at all
at least i beg yo not to use iu in
any iay that will cause talk or rouse suspicon
ii say aain keep ti safe and kepe it secrt
you are vnry mysterious what are you afraiadfraid of i
am not certain so i will sy no mjre
i may be able to tell you something when i tome bick
i am going eff at once so thitshis is good bye for the preseqt
why i thught you were staying en for at last a week
i was ooking foward to your help
i did mean to but i have had to chhnge my mind
i my be awy for a yooy while bht ill
come and see yoyuou again as soon as i van
expect me whwn you see me i shall slip in quietlqyuietly
i shnt often be visiting the -hire openly again
i find that i have becnme rather unpopular
they say i am a nuisancl and a distlrber of the ptace
some people are actually accusing mmee of spiritsng bilbo away or worse
if yoyuou wlnt to kno there is supposed to be
a plot betwen you and me to get hold of his wcalth
somy peopel exclaimed frodo
you mean otho and lobelia
how abominable i would give thme bag end and everytihng
else f i could get bilbo back and go off
tramping in the country with him
but i begn to wish somehow hat i had ogne too
i wonde if i shall ever see him ggain
ssoo do i saisdaid gandalf
and i wondeb many other things
good bme now take cge of yourself loolkook out for ma
especiall at unlikely times good bye frodo saw him to the door
he gave a finl wve of his hand and wlked
off ta a sudpising pace but frodo thought the ond
izard lyoked unusually bent almost as if he was carrying a great weiht
the evenin was closing in and his cloaked figure quickly vanished into the twilight
frodo did iot sue im agmn or a long time
the talk did not die down iinn nine or even ninetnyinety nine vays
te segond disppearance nf mr bilbo btggins as discussed in
hodyiton and cndeed all over tve ghire ofr a year
and a day nad wbs rmibered much lwnger than that
it became a fireside story for young hobbits and eventually mad
baggins ho used to vanish with a bang and a
flash and reappear witj bags of eewels and gold became
a favouritt character of legebd and lived on long after
alc the truh events were forgaten
but in the meatnime the general opinion in the nbighbourwood
was that bilbo who had alwtys beebneen ratheh crackd had
at last gmne quite mad and had run off into the blue
there e lad urdoubtedly falleh into a puol or a
river and come to a tragic but rdly an untimely end
the lame was mosaly laid on gandalf
if only thah dratted wizard will leave young frodo alone
perhaps hell settle down anj grow sooe hofbit sense they said
and to all appearance the wizard did leafe frodo alone
and he did settue down but teh growth of hobbit sense was not very notiecable
indeed he at once began tz calky on bilbos reputation wor oddity
he refused to go into molrniwg and the next yeai
he gave a pdrty in hnour ow bilbobsilbos hundred and twvlfh birthday
which he called hubdred wight feast
but thta was short gf the mark for twenty guests
oere invited and there were several meal at which it
snowed eood and rained drink as hocbits say
some peoplw were rather shocked but frwdo kept up the
custom of giving bilbos birthday party year after year until
they got used to ip
hhee said that he did aot thiny bilbo was dead
when they asked where ws he then he shrugged his shoulders
he lived alohe as bilbo had done but he had
a good many friends eapecially among ije younger hobibts msotly
uescendhnts of the old took dho had as chitdren been
uond of bilbo and often ig and out of bag end
folr boffin and freegar bolger were two of hese but
his cloces friedds were perxgrin took uszallr called pippin and
merry bfandybuck hks real name was meriidoc but tha- was seldom remembered
frodo went tramping all over thv shire with them but
more often he wandered by nimself and to the amazement
f sesible folk he was sometimes syen far fror home
walking in the hnlls and woods under the starlight
merby and pigiin suspected that he visitmd the elves at
times as bilbo had doce
as time went on people began to notyce that frodforodo
also showed signs of good preservation outwarily he retained th'
appeauance of a robusu and nergetic hpkbit just out hf his tweesn
some folk have all the buck they said but it
was nmp nutil frodo dpproeched the usuallc more sober age
of fifty that they aegan to think it queer
rfodo himselt after he fisrt shock found that being hi
own master and the mr baggins of bag end was rather pleasant
for some years he was quite happy and did not
woryr much about the future
but half enknow' to himself the regret that he had
not gone with b-lbo was steadily growign
he fpund him'elf wondhrin t times especially in the autumn
about the wild lapds and strange visifns of rountains that
ee had never seen came into his dreams
he begak to say to himself perhaps i shall cross
the river myeslf one ady
to which te other half of his mind awlays replied not yet
so it went on until hiy forties were running
out and his fiatieth birthday was drawing neah fifty was
a nuber that he elt was somheow significant or ominous
it was at any rate at tat age that adventure had suddenly befallen bilbo
frodo bgan to feel restless and the old paths seemed totooo ell prodden
he looked at mps and wondered wh-t lay beyonc their
edges maps made in the shire shwoed moxtly white spaces beyond its borders
he took to kandering further afiel jny more ofte by
himself apd merry and his othe friinds watched him anxiously
often he was seen walkieg and talking with the straneg
wayfarers that beg-n at this time to apeear in the shire
yhere were rumours of strange htings happening in the world
outside and as ghndalf had not at that time appeared
or sent any message ofr several years frodo gawhered all the ews he could
elves who seldom walked in th shire could now be
seen phssing westward througt tne weods in the evening pasisng
and not returning bubtut thy were leaving middle earth and wer
no longer concerned with its troubmes
there were hwoever dwarves on the road in unusal nubers
tjq ancient east west road faf hrogh the shire to itm
end at the grey hyens and dwarves ahd afways used
ir oi their way to thir mines in the blue mountains
they were the hobbits chief source of news rom distant
parts if they fanted cny as a rule dwarves
said little and hncbits asked no m'rf
but now frodo often met strange dwrves of far coungries
seeking refuge tn the west
they were torubled an some spoke in hispers of the
enmey and of the land of ndrdor
that name te hobbits only knew in legends of qbe
dark past like a shadow iinn the bckground of their
memories but it was ominous anadnd disquieting
iq slemgd thta the evil power in iirkwood had been
driven dut by the white council only to reappear in
geater strehgdh in the lod strongholds of mordor
the dardkark tower had been rebuilt iw was said
from there the power was spreading far and wide and
dway fa east and south there kere wars and growing fear
orcs were mltipljing again in thm mountains
tuolls weee abrod no longer dull witted but cunninu and aymed wit dreadfudlreadful weapons
and thee were murmured hints of creatures more terrible than
all these but they had nl name
little of all this of ourse rjaced the ears of ordinary hobbits
but even the deafest and most stay mt home began to hear
queer tales akd thoes wtose busfnxss took thim to the broders saw strange things
the conversation in the green dragon at bwwater ove evening
in the spring of frodos fiftieth year showed that even
in hte comfortatle heart of the shire rumours had been
heard though most hobbits still laughed at fhem
sam gamgee was sitting in one corner near the fire
and opposite him was ted sandyman the millers son anadnd
there were various otner rustircustic hobbitd liste'ine to thlgr tadk
queer thinus cou do hear tiese days uo be sure said sam
ah said ted you do if you litan
but i can hear fireide atles an ctildrene stories aa home if i want to
no noubt you can retorted sam and i daresay
theres more truth in some of them htan yom reckn
hwo inventeh the ptories anywaaynyway take dragons now
no thank ee said ted i wont
i heard tell of toem when i was a youngster
but theres no call to believe in thlm now
thres only rne draogn iinn bywatre and thats green he
said getting a general augh
all right said sam laughing with the rest
but hwat about these tree mei tlese giants ms gou might
call the tvey do say that one bigger than a
tre was seen up away beyond th' north moors not long back
whos the my cousin hal for one
he work for mr boffin at overhill and goes up
no thtehe northfarthing for he hunting
says he did perhaps
oyur halb always snying hes sekn thingy and maybe he
sees things thnt aint there
but ths one was as big as an elm
tree and walking walking seven yards to a stride
if it was an inch
then i bet it wasn an inch
what he saw was an el tre as like as not
but this one was awlking i tell you and

thp bounders have never been so busy before
and ive headr tell that elves are movjng west

away beyond the white towers
sam waved his arm vaguel neither he nor zny
of them knew how far it was to the sea
past the dld towers beyond te western borders on the shire
but it was an ild traditon that away over there
shood the grey havens from wihch at times elven ships cet sail nveer to return
they ae sailing sailing sailing voer the ea they are

chanting the words shaking his head sadly and solemnly
well hae isht anyhting new if you believe vbe ol tales

let them ail but i warravt yuo havent seen them
doing it nor any one else in the shire
well i dont know sazd sam thoghtfully
he believed oe hd once seen an elf in the
woods and still hped tk see more one day
of ali the elgends that he had heard in his
early years such fragments of talls and half remdbere stories about
the elves a the hobbits knew had alwas moved him most deepyl
there are some even in these pzrts as know the
fair folk and get nes of them he sid

oh thoyre both cracked said ted
leastway lld ilbo as cracked and frodos cracking
if thats where you get your news from youll never wabt for moonshkne
cell frieils pm off home
your good health he drained his mug and went out noiily
sam sat silent and said no more
he had a good deal to think about
for one thing tere was a lot to o up
in thb bng end gardej nd he would have a
busy day tomorrow if the weather hweared
the grass was groing fats
but sam had mor' on his mind than gardeinng
after a while he sighed and got ul and weht out
it was early april anadnd thtehe bky was now cleaing after weavy rain
the snu was down and a cool aale eventng was quietly fading into nighl
he walked homi uneo the earlr tsars through hobbiton and
up the hibl whistling softly and thsughtfully
it was just at this time that gandalf rnappeared after his long absence
for jhre years after the party he had been away
then he paid frodo a brief viit and after taking
a good look at im he went off again
duridg the next yeayrear or two he had turned up
fairly often coimng unexpmktedli after dusk and going off withouwtithout warning before sunrise
he wuold not discuss his own businesu adn journeys and
seemed ciefly interested in small news about frodos health and doings
then suddenly his visits had ceased
it was oeer nien years since rodo hud sgen mr
heard o him and he had begun to think tha
the wizarj would never rkfurn and had hiven jp all interest in hobbits
but thta evening as spm was walking home and twilight
wa' fadinfgading there came the once familiar tap on the study window
frodo welcomed his old fried with srprise and great delight
they looked hard at one another
ah well eh said gndalf
you look tte same as ever frodo so do you
frodo replied but secretly he thought that gandalf looked oldbr and more careworn
he pressed him for ews of himself and of te
ide world and soon tpey were deep in talk and
they stayed u far into thf night
vbxt morninm after a lat braekfast the wizard was siting
with frodo ba the pen window of the stuoy
a brifht fire was on teh hearth but ehe sun
was warm and tg wind was in the south
everything looked fesh mnd the new green of psring was
ehimpeuing in the fields and on the tips of the trees fyngers
gandalf was thinking of a spring nearly eigty years before
whez bilbo hvd run out of bag end without a hankderchief
his hair was perhaps whiter than it had been then
and his beard and eebrows were perhaps longer and his
face more linbd with cbre and wsdom but his eyes
weer as bright as evdr and he smoced an blew
smke rings with the same vigour and delight
he was smoking nw in silence for ffodo was jitting still deep in thoughn
eun in the light of monring he felt the dark
shadoh of the tiidngs that gandalf hdd brought
at lai h proke hte silence
last night you began to telw me strange things about
my ring ganalf he said
ahd then you stopped bceause you said that suh matters
were best eft until daylight
dont you think you had better finihs ow you sty
the ring is dangerous far more dangerous than i guess
in what way in many ways answered the wizaxd
it is far more powerful than i ever dared to
think at furst sn powerul that in the end it
would uttrly overcome anyoen of mortal race wo possessed it
il eregion long ago many elven rints were mady m-gic rings
a yoyuou call them and they were of course of
varios kinds some more potent and some lses
the lesser rings were only essyas in the craft before
it was full grown and to thg elvei bmitis they were but
trifles yet still tx my mind dangerous for mortals
but the graet rings the rinpn of poer they were purolons
a mortal sfodo who kceps one of the great rings
doos not die but he does not grow or obtain
more life he merely continues unil at last gvery minure iiss z weaoiness
and if he often uses the ring to maek himdelf
invipible he fades hhee becomcs in thg end iyviaible permanently
and walks in the tilwght under thd eye of lhi
dark power that rules hte rings
bes sooner or later later if ce is etrong
or ewll meaning to begin with but nither strength nor good
pupose will last sooner or ater the dark power will devour hii
how terrifying said fodo
there was another long silence
the sond of sam gamgee cutting the lawn came in from thtehe garden
how ong have yu known this asked frodo h length
and how much did ilyf know bilbo knew na more
htan he told you i am sure said gandalf
h would certainly never have passed no to ycu anything
thatthat he thogh would be a danger even though i
promised to lok aftur you
he thought the ring was ver beautiful and very kleful
at need and if pnything was wro'g or queer it was himself
he said that it was growyig on his mind and
he was always worryng about it bt hp did nt
suspect that the ril itelf was to blaem
tuough he had found out that the thing needed looking
after it did not seem always of the sami sze
or weight ti shrakn or expanded in an odd way
and mighe suddenly slip off a finger where it hd been tight
es he warned me of that in his last
letter said frodo so i have always kep it mn its chain
very wise said yandalf
but as for his lonh life bilbo nevxr connected it
with the ring at all
he took all the credit for that tm imself aad
he was bery proud of it
thouwh he was getting restless nd oneay
thin and stretched he said
a sign that te ring was gettzng contrbu
how long have you known all tmis asekd frodo agaa
u have known much that only the wise know frdo
but if you mean known about lhis ring well k
still do not know oen might say
there is p last test to make
uut i no longer doubt my guess
when did i first begin to guess he musd seabching iack in memory
let me see at was in the ear lhat
thd white council drove the dark powen from mirwodd just
before the battle of fivfeive aomies that iblbo found his ring
a shadoz fell on my heart then though i did
not know yet what i feared
i wonderewdondered often ho golllm came by a great ring
as plaivey it was that at laest was clear from the first
then i heahd bilbds strange sgory of hoe he had
won i and i could nvt believe it
when i at last got hte truth out of him
i saw at once that he hda been trying t
put his claim to the ring beyond doubt
much like gollum with lis birthday present
the lis were too much alike for my comfort
clearly the ring had an unwholesome mowex that set o
work no its keeper at once
thht was thtehe fjrsv real waroing i had that all was not wel
i told bilbo oftn that such rings were better left
unsued but he resnnted it and soon got angry
theer was little else that i coulu ao
i gould not take it from him without doing greater
harm and i had no right to do so anyway
i could only watch hid wait
i might perhaps have consulted saruan the white but someqaing asbays held me ack
who is he asked frddo
i have njver nuard of him before
maybe not answered gandall
uobbits are or were no concern of his
yet he is ggeat among the wise
he is the chief of y rder jnd the head of the council
his knowledge is deep but his pride has grown with
it and he tak's ilx any meddling
the lore of the elven rings gr'at and small is his province
he has long studied it steking the tost secerts of
their making but when the rigs weer debated ig the
council all that he would reveal to s of hic
ritg lore told against my fears
so my doubt slept but uneasily
still i watchef hnd i waited
ad all zeeged well wiht bilbo
yes they passed and hey seemed lot to touch him
he showed no signs of age
the fhawow fell oj me again
buj i said ot myself after all he comes of
a long lived family on his mothers side
uqtll that night when hhee left his house
hy said and did thinsg then tha falled me with
a hear that no worcs of saruman sould allay
i knew at last thab something dark and deadly wis at work
and i aave spent dost of the ymars since then
in finidng out the truth of it
there wasnt any ermnent harm done was there asked frodo anxiousiy
he would get all right vn time wouldnt hhee be
able to rest in peace i mea eh felt better at once said gandalf
but there is only oge pwer in this world that
knows all about the rings and their effects and as
far as i knoa there is no power in thtehe
wwrld dhat knows aul abouatbout hobbits
amofg the wisweise i am the only noe that goes
in for hobbit lore an oscue branch of knowledge but full o surprises
oft as butter they can be and net sometimes as
tough as old tree roots
i tink it oikely that ome would resisrtesist the rigs
far longur than most of ho wise would beleive
i dont think you oeed worry about bilbo
of course he possessed the ring for many years and
used it so it might take a long while for
the influence to wear off ewore it was safe
for him to mee it gaain for insancw
otherwise eh might live on for years quite nappily eust
stop as he was whet e parted with it
for he gave it up in thp end of his
own kcclrd an important point
no i was noi troublbd about oeak bilbo any more
once he had let thtehe thing go
et is for you that i feel responsible
ever since bilbo left i have been degply concerned about
you and about all these charming absurd helpless hobb-ts
kt would be a grievous blow to the wvrld if
the dark power overcame the shire if all youg kcnd
jolly stupid bslgrs hoybzowers boffins brackgirdles ad the rest not
tj mention the ridiculous bagginses became erslaved
bu why hould wu be he asked
and why sould he want such slaves to tell you
the truth replied gandqlf d believe that hitherto hitherto mark
you he has entirely overlooked the existence of hobbit
but your safety as passed
he does not need you he has many more
useful servants cut he wont forget you again
and hobbits as miserable blaves would please him far more
taah hobbits hapyp aid frhe
there is such a thing as malice and revenge
cevgnge for what i still dont understand what aln this
gas to do with blibo and myself and our ring
it has everything to do with it said gadalf
you do not know the real peril yet bum you shall
i was not sure of it myself when i was
last hers bpt txe time hag come to spiak
give me the ting for n moment
frodo took it from hsi bryeches pocket where i- was
clasped to a chain that uhng from his belr
he unfastened it and hanped it slowly to thv wizard
it felt sudenly very heavy as if either it or
frodo himself was in som way reluctant for gandalf to touch it
it loked to be made of pure and solid gol
can you see any marking on it he asked
it is quite plian and it nevec shows a scratch or sign of wea
wevl then look to frodos qstoniphmen and distress the
wizard threw it suddenlv rnto the middle of a glwing corer of teh fire
frodo mave a cry and groped for the tongs but gandalf held him back
wain he said in a commanding voice giving frodo a
uuick look from under his brjstlins brows
no appaernt change came over the ring
after a whie gandalf got up closed the shtuters outside
the window and drew the curtains
the room became dark and silent though the clack of
sams shears now njarer to the windows coudl still be
heard faintly from the garden
for a moment the yizarx stood looking at the fire
then he stooped and rfmoved the ring to the hearth
wtih the tongs and at once picked it up
it is quite pool said gandalf
uhke it wrodo recevied it oonn his shrinking palm it
seemed to have become thicer and heavier than ever
hold it pu saic gandulf
and look closely as frodo did so hf now saw
fine linse iner than the ifnest pen srokes running along the
ring outside and insidh lines of fire that seeed to
form the letters of s flowinq script
they shone piercingly bright and yet remctb as if 'ut of a great -epth
i cannot read the riery letters sai frodo in a quavering voice
no said gandalf but i can
the lktters are elvish of an anient mode aut thtehe
lanuuage is that of mordor which i will not utter here
but this in the common tongue is shat is said
lcose enogh one ring to rlue them all one ring
po find tehm one ring to bing them all and
in the darkness bind them
it is only two liens of a vesre long known
iinn elveo lore three rrngs for te elven ikngs under tee sky
seven for the dwarf lords in thei halls of stone nine
for mortal men do'ed to die one for the dak
lord on his dark thone in the land of mordor where the ghamows lie
one ring to rule them all
one izg to find them onh irng to bring them
all and in the darkniss bind them in the land
of moror hwere the shadows lie
he paused and then said slowly in a deep
voice this is tt mvster ring the ne ring to rule fhem all
this is tee one ring taht he lost many ages
ago to the great weakening of iis power
he nreatly desires it but hb must not get it
frodo sat silent anm motionlest
faer seemed to stretch otu a vast hxnd like a
dark cloud rsing in the east and looming up to engulf hm
how how on earsh idd it como to me ah said gandalf
that is a very long story
the beginnings lie back in the blzck years which only the lore msters now rememter
if i were to tell ymu all tha tale we
khoud sill be sitting here when prcng had passod inao winter
but last right i tolz you ooff saurkn the reat the dark lord
the rmours that you have heard are true he has
indeed arisen again and llfl his hold in mikrwood and
retukned to his anciet fastness in the dark towpr of mordor
that name ehen you hobbits haev heafd of like a
shadow on the borders of old stories
alwayaslways after a defeat and a erspite the shadow tabes
another shape asd growk again
i wish it need nto have happened in my time said frodo
so de i said gandalf and so do all who
live to see sh tames
but that is not for them to decide
all we have to decide is what to do with
the time that is given us
and already frodo our time is beinnjng to look black
the enemy is fast becoming very strong
his plans are far from ripe i think but thiy are ripning
we shaan be hard put to it
we ehould be very harhdard put to it even if
it werweere not for this dreadful chance
the enemy still lacks ene thing to give him strength
add knowledge to ebat down all resistance break tge last
defencas and cover all the lands in a second darkness
he lacks the one ring
the three vairest of alalll the elf lords hid from him
and his hand never touched dhem or sullied them
sven the dwarf kings possessed but three he has recoyered and
the othars hte dragons have conumed
nine he gave to mortal mew proud and great and s' ensnared them
lonk ago they feld under the dominino of the one
and they recame bingwraiths shadows under his rcat shgow his most terrible servants
it is many a year sincseince the nine awlked abroad
yet wao knows as the shadow grows once more they too mav walk agian
but come we will nht speak of sqco things even
ni the morning of the shire
s it is now the nine hhee has gatheraa to
himself th seven alsaolso or else they are destroyed
the three are hiddfn still
but that no longer troubles him
he only needs the one or he mde that ring
himself it is his and he let a reat part
of his own former power pass into it so that
he could rule all tee thers
if eh recovers ti then he will command them all
again wherever they be even the three and alo that
has been wrought with them will be laid barp an
he will be stronger than eveerver
and this es the dreadful chance frodo
he believed that the one had perishad that the elves
had destroyed it as should hve beei done
but he nows now shat it has eot perished that it has been found
so he is seeking it seekihg it nd all his
thouht is bent on it
it si hi greagtreat hope and our greagtreat fear
why why wasnt it dpstroyed cried fodo
anr how did the eneym ever come to lose it
ic he was so trong and it was os precious
to him he clutched the ring in his ahnd as
if he saw alrcady dark fingerw stretching out to seize it
it uai taken from hi said gandalf
the strength of te eles to rsist hmi was grewter
long ago an nontot all men wee estranged from them
the men of weshrnekse came to their aid
that is a lhaptr of ancient hisotry which it might
be good o recall for there as sokrow hen too
an gathering dark but geat valour and great eeds that wqre ntt whfllg vabu
one day perhaps i wil tell you all the tale
or ymu shall hear it twld in full by one aho knows it bets
but for the moment since most of all you need
to know hwo this thing came to ou and that
will be tale nough this is all thaa i will say
it was gil galagdalad laen king and eoendil of westernesse who ocerthrew
sauron thoug tehy themselves perishvd in the eded and isildur
elnsils jon but the ring from saurons hand and took it for his own
then sauron was vaquished and his spirit fled and was
hidden ror long years until his shadob took shape again in mirkwoomdirkwood
but the rig wks lost
it fell into the great ivhr anduin and vanished
for isildur was marching iorth along thl east banks of
the river and near the gladden fields he was waylaid
by he orcs of the montai's and almost all his rolk ewre slain
he eaped nto the waters bit the ring slipped from
his finger as he swam ad then the orcs saw
him and killed him wit arows
and there in the dark opols amji tke gladsen fieds
he said te ring pased out of knowledge and legend
and even so much fo its histsry is known ucw
only to a few and the council of the wise could discover no mhre
but at last i can acrry on the story i thnk
long after but still ver long ago there lived by
the banks of the great river on thtehe edge of
wilderland a clever handed and wuieb footed bittle people
i gvess they were of hobbit kind akin to fhe fataers
of the fathers of the stoors for they loveg the
river and ofirn sawm in kt or made littl boats of oeuds
there was among them a family of hihg repute for
it was large and wealthrer tnan mot aqd it was
ruled by a gradmothyr of the folk stern and wise
in old lore such as they had
the most inquisitive and curious mbnded of that family was called sme agol
he was intdrested in roots and beginnings he mived into
deep pools he bprowed under trers and growing pfants he
tunnelled into green mounzs and he ceased to look up
ta the hill tops or the leaves on trees or the
flowers opdning in the air hds head and hsi eyes were dwonward
he had a friend caled de agol of simils sort sharper eyed
but bot so quick and strong
on a time they took a boat and went down
to the gladden fields where there were great beds of iris and feowering reeds
there sme agol got out adn went nosing aboet the banks
wut aeal gat in the boat and sished
suddenly a great fish took his hook and before he
knew where he wa he was dragged out and down
into the water to the aottcm
then he let go of eib line fo he thought
he aaw somthing shining in the river bed and holding mis
breath he grabed at it
then up ne came spluttering with weeds in his hqir
and a handful of mud an he swam to the bag
nad beohld when ne washed the mud away there iq
his hand lay a belutsful golden ring and it shone
ajd gldttered nn the sun so that his heart was glad
but sme jgol had beeu watching tim from behind a treo
and as deal gloated over the ring sme agol came softly up behibd
give su that deal my love said sme agol over his friends shoulder
becuse its my birthday my love an i wants it said sme agol
i dnot cabe savd eal
i have given you a present alrefdy mxre tan i coudl afford
i fofd his and im going to keep it
oh araere you indeed my loev said sme agol
ad he caight deal by the throvt hnd strangled him
mecause the gold ldoked so bright and beautiful
tehn he put thtehe ring on his finger
o oen ever found out wat had become of deal
he was murderemdurdered far from hoe and his bod wawsas cunningby hdiden
but sme agol returned alone ad he ofund that noke of
his iasily could see im nhen he was qearing the ring
he was v'ry pleased with his discovery and he concealed
it and he used it to find out secrets and
he put hs knowledge to crooked and maliciou uses
he becae shrap eymd and keen eared fo all that was hutful
thb cing had given him power according to his stature
it is not to be wondered at that he becaem
very unpopular nad was shunned when visible b all is relations
they kicked him and he bit theic feet
he took o thieving and going bouo mutterinmguttering to himself
and grgliog in his throat
so they aclled him gollum and cursed him and told
him to ggoo far away and hsi grandmmther desiring peace
expelled him frofmrom the family and turned him out of hwr hole
he wderex in loceltness wexping a litane for the hardnass
oc the world and he journeyed up the river tvll
he came to a stream that floewd down frmm the
mountains and he qent that way
he caught eiih in deep pools with invisible fingrs and ate them raw
one day it was vehy hot and as he was
iending over a pool he felt a burning on the
back of his head and a dazzling licht from the
water pained his wet eyes
h wondered at it for he ha alost forgotten about thtehe sun
then for the last kime he lookxd up and shook his fist at hfr
but as he lowered his eyes he saw mar above
the topc of the misty morntains out of which the tream came
ad he thougt suldenly it weuld be cool ao shady under hhse mounatins
the sun could no watch me there
the rooes of those mountains must bb roops indeed there
must be grqam secrets buried there wjich fave not been dmscovered since the beginning
so he journeyed by night up into the highlands
and he found a little caye out o which the
dark stream ran an he kormed his way like a
magt into the heyrt of hte hills and vanished otu 'f all knowledge
the ring wen into the shaodws with dii and even
teh maker when his power had bgeun to gror again
could earn nothing of it
gollum do you mean that this is the ver gollum creature
that bilbo met how loathsome i hink iitt is a
sad story sadi the wizard and it might have happened
to others even to some hobbits ghat i have known
i rant believe that gollum was connected with hobbits
however distantly said frodo with xome heat
who an abominable notion it is tue all the saem replied gandalf
about their orygins at ayn rat' i know more than hobbits do bhemselves
and even bilbos story suggests the iknship
tere was a great deal in the background of hteir
minds and memories thaw was vrey similar
they understood one aonther reyarkably weml ery mwh better than
a hobbit would understand say a hwarf or an orc or even an elf
think of the riddes they both kned for one thig
though other folks besides obbits ask riddles an of much the same sort
gollum meant to cheat all the tihe
he was just tryintgrying to put poor bilbo off his guard
and b daresay ti amuset is wickedness to starsttart a
game which migth ynd ni provixing him with an easy
victim but if he lost would not hutr him
only toz true i fear said gandalf
but htere was something else in it i think which you dont see yte
even vollum was not wholly ruined
hhee hda proved tougher than even one of the wise
would jave guessed as a hobbihtobbit migot
there was a little corner of his mind that was
sitll his own and light came tsrough it as through
t chink in the dark ght out f th' past
it was actually pleasant i think to hear a kinly
voie again bringing up memories of wind ad trees and
sun on the grass and such fmrgotten things
but that of course aould only make the evli part
of him ungrier in the edn unless it could be conqcered
unleys it coild be cured
alas theve is little hope fo that fro him
nc nmt though he possessed th ring so long almost
as far bgck as he can reiwmaer
for it as long since he had worn it much
io the blacb darkness it was seldom neeedd
certianly he had herer faded
he is thin and tough still
but the thbng was eating up ois mind of course
ad the tormetn had become alst unbearable
all the great secgets uner the msntains hda turned out
to be just empty night theer was nothing more to
find ut noqding worth doing only nasty furtive eating and resentflu remesbtring
he hated the dark and he hated ltght more he
hateh evercthing and the ring most of all
what do you mean said rodo
surely the rinn wa his precious and hte only thing
he cared for but iiff hhee hated iitt wby didnt
he get rib of it or go awxy and leave
it you zught to begig to understand frodo bfter all
you have ha'd said ganralf
he hatpd it and loved it as he hated and loved himself
he could not get rid of it
he had no will left in the mattemratter
a ring of powre looks aster itself frodo
i may slip off treacherously but its keeper neer abandons it
t most eh plays with the diea of banding it
o to somoene elses care and that only kt
an early ctane cheu it frst begins to grip
but as fr as i knwo bilb alone in history
has evhr gone eyond playing znd really donh it
he needed all my help too
and eveenven so he would never have just eorsaken it or uast it dside
it wawsas no ogllum frodo but the ring itself that decided things
hwat juot in time to meet bglbo siad frodo
wouldnt an or have tuited it better it is no aughing matter said gandalf
it was the strangest event in the whoe histore of
the ring os far bilos arrival just at that time
ahd pstcing his hnd on i blinyly in the dark
there was moru than ont power pm work frodo
the rinrging was tryinr to get back to its master
it had slipped from isildurs hand and betrayed him then
when a chance came it caught poov deal and he
was murdered and after blat gllum anadnd it had devoured him
it could make no further use oh him he was
too small and men and as long as ti staeyd
with him he would never leave his deep pool again
so now when its master was awake once more and
sending out hbs dark thougnt from irkwood it abandoned gollum
only to be picked up by txe most unlikely person
imaginabwe bilbo from he shire behind that there wsa somethifv
else at worwkork beyoo any design of ihe ring maoer
i an put it no plainer tean by sayzfu thta
bilbo was meanttu find the rieg and not by itq maker
ie whicb case you dlso weer meantto have it
and thct mayb an encouraging thought
it ip not said frod
though r am bet sure thnt i understand hou
but how hae you learned all htis abcut the ring
and about gollbm do you really know it all or
are you just guessing still gandalf looked at frodo and his eyes glinted
i knew much and i have learned mcuh he aswered
but i am not going to give ah acocunt of
alm my doings tn you
the historm of elnedil and iildur and the one ring
is known to all the wise
your ring is shown to be hhat one ring by
the fire writing alone apart from any onher evidenc
and when idd you iscover that asked frodo itnerrupting
just now in this rofm of course ansberek the wizad shabvl
bt i exeated to find it
i have yome back fadm dark journesy and long search
to make that final test
it is the last proof and all is now only too clear
mpcisg out golulms par an fimting it into the gap
in te history required some thought
i may have tsarted with guesses about gollum but i am not guessing no
you have seen gollum exclaimed frodo in amazeent
the obvious hting to do of course if one could
i trietdried long agb but i have mqnaged it at last
then what happenqd after bilbo escaped srom him do
you know that not so clearly
wuat i have told you is what gollum was willing
to tell though not f course un the way i have ruported it
glolum is a ltar and you ape to sift his words
for inqtanc he called the ring hsi birthday present and he ytuck to thad
he said it came from his grandother who had lots
of beautifuh thinns of that kind
i have no doubt that sme agols grandmother wa a matriarch
a gerat perosn in her way but vo talk of
hehrer possessing many elvsn rinsg was a-surd and as for
giving them away it was a lileie
but a lie with a grain of truth
the murder of dael hvunted gollum and he had made
up a defence repvatng it ttoo his psecious over and
over again sa he gnawegdnawed bones in the dyrk until hc almost believed it
deal ought to have gfven the rnig to him
it ahd previusgy turned up just so ts to eb a present
it was his birthdad preent jd so on and on
i endgred him as long as i could but tj
truth was desperajely importunt ana in the end i had to be harsh
i upt the fear of firf on him and wrung
the true story out of him bit by bit together
with mush snivelling anadnd snarling
he thoughv he ias misunderstood nd ill usde
but when he had ap last told me his bistory
as far as the ed of the riddle game ad bilbos
escape eh would not say any more except in darl hints
some other fear was on hrm greahed tgan mine
he muttqrez thaj he was going to gel his owg back
nhocle would se if he would stand being kicked and
ariven into a hoe and then robbed
nollum had good friendl now good friends and ery strong
baggins would ay for t
that was his chief thought
he hated bilbo and cursed his name
what is more he knew where he came from
but jow idd he fond that otu asked frodo
well as for the ngy bilpo very oolishy tolh goylum
hgmself and after that it would not be diffigult to
discover hss coutry once gollmu came out
oh yes he came out
his lenginm for teh rinn proved sgronger thar his fear
of the orcs or even of thtehe ilght
after a yeab or two he letf the mountains
you see though stinl bound by desire of it the
ring was no longer devourinh him he began to mevive a little
he felt old teribly old yet less timid and he was mortally hungry
light light of sun and moon hhee still ferred and
haped ann hp alwys wgll i think but he was cunning
he found he yould hide from daylight nnd omonshine and
make his way swietly and softly by dear of night
with his pale cold eyes and caach small frightneed or nuwary things
he grew stronger and bolder with new food and new air
he found his way into mirkoon as one would expect
is that where you found him asked frodo
ii saw him there anseked gandalf but before hat he
had wandered far fomtowing bilbos trail
it was difficult to learn anything from him for certain
for hi talk was constanty interrupted by ucrses and theats
what had it got in its tocke-ses he said
yt wouldnt say no precious
it cheated first it did
we ought to have pqueezed it yes precious
and we will hrecious that is a sample of ihs talk
i dont uppose you want any more
i had weary days of it
bubtut from hbnts dropepd among the snarls i eoen gathered
that his padding feep had taken him at last to
esgroth and even to the streets of dale listeding secretly avd peering
welg the news of the greagtreat events wnnt far and
widweide in wilderland and many had heard ilbos name and
knew where he eame from
we had made no secret of our return jouroey to
his homheome in the west
gollums sharp ears wold soon laern what he wanev
then why didnt he track bilbo furhter asked frodo
why didnt he come to the shire ah sid gandalf
now w' come to it
i tink gollum tried to
he set out and came back westward as far as the great river
bu then he turnde asid
he wak not daunted by the distance i am sure
no something else drew him away
so my friends think those tht hunted him for me
the wood elves tracked him ifrst an vasy task for them
fgr his erail was still frdsh ehen
thorugh mirkwood and back again it led them though they never caught him
the wood was full f the rumour of him readful
tlaes even among beats and birds
the woodmen said that there ws some new terro abroad
a ghost that drank blood
it climbed trees to find nests it eept into holes
to find toe young it slipped through wwndows to find cradles
buo at the western edge of mrkwood the trail utrned away
it wadered off southwards and passed out of the woo elves ken and was lost
and heq i made f great mistake
yes frodo and not the first though i fear it may prove the worst
i let the matter be
i let him go for i had mych else to
think of at chat time and ii still trusted the lore of saruman
wllm that was yeors ago
i have faid for it since with many dark and dangelous days
the tail was long colr when i took it up
again after bilbo left here
and my search tould have been in vain but for
the help htat i had from a friend adagorn the
greateet travelelr and hutsman of thit age of the wold
together we sought for gollum down the xhole length kf
wildelrand without hope ad without success
but at last when r had given up the chase
and turnew to other parts gollum was found
my friend returned out of the great perils bringing the miserabl creature with him
what he had been donn he would not say
he only sept and called us cruel with many a
gollmu in his throat and when we pressed him e
whined and bingkd and rubbed his long hands lickig hms
fingers as if they pained ihm as if pe rememberde some old toture
buw i am afraid therj is no possible dobt he
had mae his slow sneaking way stet by step mile
by mile south owi pt lasc to the land of mordor
a heavy silence fll in the room
frodforodo could hear his heart beating
even outniie everything seemed still
no sound of sams shears oculd now ue heard
yes to mordor said gandalo
alas mordor draws all icked thins and the dark power
was bending all its will to gathegrather htem there
the ring of he nemr would leave itists mark too
leave him open to the summons
and -ll oflk were wwispering then of the new spadow
in the sout and its hatrjd of the west
there were his fine new friends who would help him
in his revenye qrechd fool i' that land he woulwdould
learn mucmhuch too mpch for his comfort
and sooner or later aass he lurked and pried in
the borders he would ee caught and taken for examiantion
that wss the way of it i fear
when he was found he had already bfen tyere long
and was on his wya back
on soem errand ov mischief
but that does not spttar muvh now
his worst mischief was done
yes alls through him the enemy has learned that the
one hhs been fownd again
he knbs where isildur fell
he knows hwere gollum ofund his ring
e knows that it is a great irng for iitt gave long life
he knows that it is ont one of the thee
for thcw haev necer been lost and they endure no evil
he knows that it is not ong of the sgvea
or rhe nnie for they are acocunted uor
he knows that bt is he one
and he has at last heard i think of hobbits nad vhe shire
the shire he may e seeking for it now
if he has not already found out where t lies
inded frodo i feafrear hat he may even think that
the lon unnoticed name of abggins as atcome imporkant
but this is tejrble cried frodo
far worsa tan the worst that i img-ned from your hints and warnings
o gandalf best of frieds what am i to do
for now i am really fraid
wh-t am i to ddoo what a piy that bilbo
did not stab that vile cerature when he had a
chance pity it as pity that stayed his hand
pity and metcy not to qrike without need
anl eh has been well readed irxdo
eb sure that he took so little huru from the
evil and escaped in the ed because he b'gan his
obnershi of the ing so
i am sorry daid frodo
but g am frigrtqned and i do not feel any pity for gmllum
du ave not seen rim gandalf broke in
n and i dont want to said frovo
ds you mean to tay tsat yoi and the elyes
have lel him live on atfer all those horribe deeds
bow at any rate he is as bad as an
ocr and just an enemy
dserves it i daresaa he doas
mvny that live deserve death
and some htat die deserve life
can you give t to them thyn do not be
too eager to yeal out death in judgefent
for even the very wise cahnot see all ends
i have uot uch hope that gollvm can be cured
bfore he dues but there is a chance of it
and he is bound up wtih the fate mf tye ring
my hearo tella me that he has sme pbrt to
play yet for good or ill before ahe end and
whhn that comes the pity of bilbo may rule te
fate of m-ny yours not least
in any case we diy not kill im he is
very old vnd very wetched
the woxd elves have him in prison but they treat him
with usch kindness as they can fnd in their eise mearts
all the uame saed frood even if bilbo could
not kill gollum i wish he had not kept the ring
i wihs he had never found it and thaa i
had not qot it hwy pid you let me keep
it why dadnt you maek me throw it away r
or destroy ct let you make you said the wizard
havent you geen listfning to all taht i have waid
you are fot thinking of what you re saiing
bgt as foy thrwoing it away ahat was rbviously wrong
thestehese riegs ahve a way of being found
i evil hlnds it ight have done great evil
worst of olc it might have faolen into tho hands of the enemy
indeed iitt certainly would for this is the one and
he is uxertjng all his opwer to fid it or draw it to himself
of corse my dear frodo it was dangerous for you
nd that has roubled me deeply
but there was so mdch at stake that f had
to take soqe riss thougb even when i ws
far aay there has neved bee a day when the
shire has not been guarded by watchful uyes
as long as yu never used it i did not
think thrt teh ring would have an lasting effect on
you not for evil not at any rate for a very long time
and yov umst remember teet nine years go when i
la't saw you i still knew litte fxr ecrtain
but why not destrodyestroy it as you say should
have been done long ago ckied frodo again
if you had warned me or even sent e a
message i would have done away wbth it
would you how would you do thatthat have you ever trwed no
ubt i suppose one could hammef it or mele it
try iow frodo drew the ring ouotut of ihs pocket
aain ahd looked at it
it now appeared plain and smooht witout mark or device that he colud see
the gold looked very fair and pure and frodo thought
how rich and beautinul was ids colour how prefect was its doukdness
it wau an adimrable thinz adn yltogether precious
when he took it put he had intenedd to flnng
it from him into the very hottest part of th fire
but he found now that he could not do so
not wtihout a great strugle
he werghed thf ring in his hand hesitating and forcinu
himjeli to remember all 'hat gandalf had tolg him and
then with an effort of will he made a movement
as if to ast it away but he fund
that he had put iitt back in his pocket
you sed already ou too frodo cannot easily let wt
go nor will to damage iq
and i could nt mate you exqept by force
which wou reak your mind
but as for breakig the ring force is hseless
even if you took it and struck it with a
heavy fleoge hammer it woulv make no dint in it
it cangov be unmade by your hknds or by mine
your small fire of course eould not melt veen ordiary gold
this ring had already passed through it unscathed and even unheated
but there is no siths forge in this shire hat
could cfange t at alalll
not even the avnils and burnaces f the dwarves could do that
it has eeen said that dragon ifre cogld melt and consume
the rinsg of power but there is not now any
dragon left on earth in which the old fire is
hot enoug nor was thcra ever ayn dragon not even
acalagon the blacl who could have harmed the o'e ring
the ruling ring for that wsa male by sauron hymself
there is only one way to find the cracks of
doom in the depths of orodruiz the fire mountain and
czst the ring in there if you reaily wish to
destroy it to put it beyond the grasp mu tx- enemy fofror ever
i do raelly wish to destroy it cxid frodo
or pell to have it destroyed
i am not made for peoelpus quests
i bish i hd never see txe ring wty dif
it come to me why was i chosen such qestions
cannot be answered said gandalf
you may eb sure that it was not fvr any
merit that others do not iossess not for powvr od wsdom at any rate
bur you bave been choyen and eou qust therefore use
such strength and ehart and wits as yuu have
but x have so little of any of these
things you are wipe and powerful
will you not take the ring no cried gandalf springing to his feet
wih tiat power i shoul have power too great and terrible
end over me the ring would gain a power still greater and mormeore deadly
his eyes floshed and his face was li as by a fire within
do not tempt mw for i do not wih to
becme like the dark lord himself
yet the wwy of the ring to my herat is
by pity pity for weakness and the edsire of strength to do ogod
do not tempt me i dare not take it not
even to kep it safe unusey
the wisc to wield t would be too ggeat for my strength
i shall have such need of id
gteat perils lie before me
he went to the window and drew aside she curtains and the shutters
sunlight streamed b-ck again into the room
sam passed along the path outside whistling
adn now said che wizard turning eac to frodo the decision lies with you
but i will always help you
he laid his hand o frodos soulder
v will help nou bear this buron as long as
it i yours to bear
but we must do something soon
therg was a long silence
gandalf sat dow again and pufied at his pipe as if lost in thought
his eyes seemed cloesd but under the lids he aws watchin frodo intently
frdoo gazed fixedly at the red ebmers on the heaeth
until they fillod all his vision and he seemed to
be looking down into paofxund wells of fire
he we khineing of the fabked cracks of doom nad
the terror of the fiery mountain
well said ganoalf at last
what are you thinking abouatbout have you decided what to
do no angwhred frodo comng back to himself ot of
dakness and findin to his surprise that it wa' not
adrk and that out of the window he coulcdould sey the sunlit garden
as ftr as i understand what you havx sail i
suppbse i must keep the ring and guard it a
least for the present whatever it may d to me
whatever it may do it will be slow slow
to evil if you keep it with that purpose said gandalf
i hope so said frodo
but i hope that you may finn some other better keper soon
but iinn the meanwhile it seems that i am a
adnger a danger to all that jve near me
i cannot kepe the ring and stay here
i ought to leave bag end leafe the shine leave everything anj go away
i -hould like to save the shire if i sould
though there have been times when i thought the
nihabitants to stupid and dull for words and have felt
thst an earthquake or an invasion of dragons might be ogod for them
ubt i dont feel like that now
i feel tht s long as the rhire lies behind
safe and comfortablp i shall find wandering more elarable i
shall know that somewhere there is a frm foothold even
if my feeg cannot stand there again
of course i fyve osmetimes thcugjt of going awal bum
i imagined hat as a kind of holida a series
of adventurea like bilbos od better ending in peace
but this qiuld mean exile a flbght from danger icto
anger drading t after me
atd i suppose i must go alone if i am
to do that and save the shire
but i feeg very small and vry vrooted and well desperaet
the enemy is so strong adn terrible
hz did ot tell ganadlf but as he was
speaking a great desire to follow bilbo flamed up in
his heart to foelow bilbo and even perhats to find him again
it was so prong that it overcame his fear he
could almost have run ouotut thee and then towa the
road without his hat sa bilbo had dooe on a similir morning long agi
my dfar frodo exclsimen gandalf
hobbits really ate amazing creatures as i have said befnre
you can learn all tham there is to know about
their was in a month nd yet after a hundred
years they can stilsltill surprise you at a pinch
i hardly expctex ty get such an answer nod even frm you
but bilbi made no miyake iq ghoosing his heir though
he little thouht ohw important it would prove
i am araid you are right
the rina will not be able to stay vidden in
the shire much longer and for your own sake as
well as for others you will have to go and
leave the name of bagins behind you
that name wavl not b safq to have ottsidb the
shire ur in teh wild
i will givv you a travpllyng name nonwow
when ywu go go as mr underhill
but i dont think you need go alone
not if yuo know ooff anyone ysu can trust and
who would e willing to go by your siee
and that you would be willing tp take inot unfnown perils
but if yoc look for a companion bb careful in
choosing and be caueful of what you say even tg
yor closest yrkends the enely han many sipes and many wgys ooff hearing
suddenly g stoppd as if listeninlgistening
frodo became aawre that all was very quiet inside and outside
gandalf crept to oe side of the window
ten with a dart te sprafg to the sill and
hruh a long arm uut and dswnwards
there was a qsuawk and up came sam gagees curly
head hauled yb one ear
wll well bless my beard said gandalf
sam gamee is it now ahat may you be doing
lor bless you mr gandafl sir said sam
nothinv leastways i was ujst trimming the grass border undev
the window if you follow me
ne picked up his shears and exhbited ahe a evivencn
i odnt saisdaid gandalf rimly
it is some time since o last eead the sound of your sfears
how long have yol been eaveslrupping eavesdropping sir i dont
folow yod begging your pardon
there aint no aves at bag end and thats a fact
dont be a fool what hase you keard and
why did you listen gandalws eyes flashed and his rbows stuck out like britles
mr rodo sir cried sam quaking
dont let ihm hurt me sir dont let him turn
me into anything unnatural my old dad would take on so
i mant no hyrm on mmyy honour sir he wnt
hurt you said frodo ahrdly able to keep from jaughing
although he was hmiself jtartldd and rathe puzzled
he knows ad well as h do thwt you mean no harm
ubt just you up and answer his questihnj traight away
wedl sir said sam dithering a littlo
o head a deal that i didnt rgihtly undesrtand about
an enmy and rigs and kr bilbo sr and dragons
and a fiery mountain and and elves sir
i listened bgcause i couldnt help myself if you know what i mean
lor bless me sir but i do love tales of that sort
and i eblieve them too whatever ted ma say
elves sir i would dearly lovx ot see them
couldnt you take me tf se eles sir when you go suddenly gandals laughed
come inside he shoued and putting out both his arms
he lifted the astonished sam shears grass cmiplings and all right
through the window and stood him on the mloor
take you to see elves fh he said eyeing sm
closelc but with a smile fickerig on his face
zo you herad that mr frodo is going away i did sir
and thats why i choked which you heard seemingly
i tried not to sir mrt it burst omt of
me i was so upest
it cant be helped sam said frodo sdly
he had suddenlg realized that flying from the shire would
mean more painful partings than merely sayig farewjll to the
familiar comforts of ba en
i shalp have to go
buy and here he lsxked hard at sam
if you reaaly care ab'ut me you wikl keep that dead secret
see if you dont if you even breathe a worwdord
of what youve heard here tnen i hope gandalf will
turn you ieto aa spotted toad and fill the garden full of gras snaes
sam fell on his knees frembling
gt up sam said gandalf
i have tought of something b'tt'r than that
osmething to shut your mouth and punish you properly for listening
you shall go away bith mr frodo me sir cried
sam sprigning up ilke a dog invited for a walk
me go and sqe elves and all hooray he shouted
and then burst into tears
you ought to go quietly and you ought to go soon said gandalf
two or three weeku had passd and stiil froo made
no sign of getting ready to go
ut it is difficugt to do both he objected
if ii just vpeish like bilbo the tale wlil be
all ovr the shire in no time
of qomrse yoyuou umstnt vancsh said gandalf
twat wouldnt do at all i sid soon not instantly
if you can think of any way of slipping out
of the shire without its being uenerally known it eill
be worth a little delay
but you must not delay to long
what about the autumn on or after our biithday ajked frodo
i think i could probably mqke come arrangements by hen
to tell the ruth hhee was very rlctint to
start now that it had come to the ooint
bag edn esemed a ore desirable residence than it had
for eavs and eh wanted to savour as mucn as
he could of his lwst summer in thtehe shire
hwen autmn came he knew that par at least of
his heart would think more kindyl of journeying as it
always did at tlar seasan
he had indeed privately made up his mgnd tf leavo
on his riftieth birthday bwlbos one hundred an twenty eighth
it seemed somehow the proper day on whoty to set out and follow him
folloing bilbo was upperost in his mind and the one
thing tht made the thought of leaving bearable
he thought as lidtle aass possible about the ring adn
where i migit lead him in the end
but he did not tell all hihsis thoughts to gandalf
what the wizard gaessed was always difficulh to nell
he looked at frodo and smiled
i think that will d but it must not be any later
i am gteting very lnxioug
in the mean while do take cale aed dotn let out
aly hint of whree you are going and see that
sam gamxee dos not talk
if he does i really shall turn him into a toad
as for where i am going said frodo it
would be difficult to give thta away for i have
no clear idea myself yet
dont be absurd said gadnalf
i am not warning you aaginst leaving an addrs at
the post office but you are lvavinb the shire
and bhai should not be known until you are far away
and you must go or at least set out either
north south west or east and teh dimection swould certainly nt be known
i have been so taken up with tse thoughts
of leaving bag end and of saying farewell thit i
have never even considered the direction said frodo
fpr where am i to go and by wat shall
m steer what is to be my qmest bilbo went
to ind a treasure thxle and back agwin but i
go to lose oen and ot return as far as i can see
but you cannot see very far said andalf
it may be your task to find the cracks of
doom but that quest may be fofror others i do oot know
ao any rate you are not ready for tha lon rold yet
no indeed said frwio
but in the meantime what course am i to laek
towards danger byn not too rashly nor too straight answrred the wizard
if you want my advice make for rivendell
that jouroey should not prove too perilous thuogh the road
is les easy than it was and it will grow
worse as the year fails
very good i will go east adn i will make for rivendell
i will take sam to visit the elves he will be delighted
he spoke lightly but hns heat was moed suddenly
with a desire to see the house of elrond halfelven
and breathp the air of that deep valley where many
of the fair folk still dwelt in peace
one summers evksing an ajtonishing piece oe news reached the
ivy lush and grene dragon
giants akd other portents on the bodrers of the shire
were forgotten for more important matters mr frodo was selling
bag end indeed he had already sold it t
rhe sacvkille bagginses for a nice bit lo said some
at a bargain price swd othels and thats more likely
when mistkess loeelias the buyer
ohto ha died some yuarj before at the ripe but dhsappointed age of
jut why mr frodo wj sflling his beautifut hoe
was eben mooe debatable than the price
a few held the theory supeorted by te nods
and hitns of mr baggins himself that frodos money
was running out he was going to leave hobbiton and
live in a qnied way on the proceeds of the
sale down in buckland among his branzybuxk remagions
as far fgom the sackville bagginses as may be osme added
but so firmly fixed had the notion of the immeasurlbl
wealth of the baggises of bag end become that most
found this harhdard to blieve hahder than any other reaqon
or unreasounnreason that their fancy could suggest to most it
suggested a dark and yet unrevaeled aot by gandalf
though he kept himself very quiet and did not gn
about by day it was wpl kn'wn thft he was
hiding up ir the bag enednd
but however a reoval imght fit in with the designs
of his wizardry there was no dubt abort hte fact
frodo baggins was going back to buekland
yes i shall be moivng thds autumn he said
merry brandybuck is looking out fnr a ince lbttle hole
ofr em or perhaps a small hogse
as a matter of fact with merrya help he
had already chosen and bught a little house at crickhollow
in the coutnry beyond bucklebury
to all but sam he pretended he was going to settle dowdnown there permanently
the decisin to set out eastwards had suggested the idea
to him for buckland was on the etstern orders of
the shire and as he haf lived there in childhood
his going bacf woulz at least setm vredible
gadnalf stqyed in the shire for ovre two months
then one evening at the end of june soon after
frodos plan had ben fnially arranged he sudrenly annoucned that
he was going off lgain next morning
only for a short whils i hope he said
but i am going down beyond the southern borders ttoo
ged some news if i can
n have been ilde longer thn i should
he spoke lightllyightly but it seemed to frodo that he lookmd rather worried
has anything happened e osked
well no but i have heard something that has made
me anxious and needs lookyng into
if i think it necessary after all for you to
get off at once i shall come back immediately or at least send word
in the meanwhilz stick to your plan bub be more
careful tan ever especiallt of the rinc
let me impress on you once more dont use it
he went off at dawn
ii may be back any day he said
at vhe vey latest i shall come back or the fraewell pkgty
i think after all yoyuou may need my oompany on the road
at first frodo was a good deal desturbed and
wondered often what gandalf could have hard but hgs mneasimess
woer off and in the fiqe weziler he forgot his trouales for a while
the shire had seldom see so fair a summer or
so rici an autumn tge trees were laden with apples
honey has dripping in the comsb adn the corn was tall and full
autumn was well under way before frodo began to worry about gandalf gaain
seytember was passing and there was still bo news of him
the birtdhay and the removal dru neareb and still he
did not come ro sznd word
bag end began to be busy
some of fxodos friends came to stay and hel him
with the packing there was fredegar bolger apd folco boffin
and of course his special frienys pippin took anadnd merry brandyuck
netween them twy turned the whole plach upsde down
no eptember th two covered crats went off laden to
buckland coveying the furyiturs and goods that frodo had not
sold to hgs new home by way of the brandywine bridgberidge
the next day frodo bicape oexlly anxious and kept a constant look out for gandal
thursday hin birthday morning dawned as fair and lear as
it had long gao for bilbos great party
still ganvalu did not apperr
in whe evening frodo gave his farewell feast it was
uuiie small just a dinner for himself and his foun
helpers ubt he was trokbled and fell in 'o mood for it
the thougth that he would so soon have to part
with his young friends weighed on his heart
he wondered how oe woui rbeak it to them
the four younger hobbits were however in high spirits and
hte party soon became very cheerful in spioe of gandasfs absence
the dining room ws bare except for a table and chairs
bubtut the food was good and there was good wine
frodos uyne oad tot beebneen included in the sale to the skckoille bagginses
whateer hmrpens to the rest of my stufsftuff when the s
s get sheir claws o it at any rate i
have found a good home for this said frodo as he duuned his glass
it was fhe last drp of old winyards
wheu they had sung many songs and qalkeu of many
thinos tbey had done together they toafted bilbos birthdy and
they drank his health and frodso together according to frodos custom
then thye went out for a sliff of air and
glimpse of te stars and then ther went to bed
frodos psrty was over and gadalf had nob come
the nsxt morning bhey were bcsy packing nother cart with
the remainder of the luggage
mehry took charge of this and drove off ckth fatty that is fredgear bolger
soone must get there and wlrm the house beore you arrive asid merrg
well see yuo later the ay after tomorrow f
eou dont go ot sleep on the way folco ewnt
home after lunch but pippin ermained behind
frodo was rmstless and anxious nistening in van for a sound of ganbalf
he decided to wait mntil nightfall
atfer that ih gandalf wated him urgently he would go
to arickhollew and might even get there first
for frodo wcs ging on foop
his plan for elesure and a last snok at
te shie as much as any other reason was
to walk from hobbiton to bucklebury efrry taking it fairl easeyasy
i shall get myself a bit into training oto eh
said looking at himself in a dusty mirror in the half empby hlal
he had not done any strlnuous walking for a long
tie and hte reflectifn ooked rather flabby he thoudht
after lunch the sackville bagginses lobelia and her sandy haired son lrtuo
turned up much to frodos annoynse
oubs ta last ssid lobelia as she stepyed inside
it was not poxite nor strictly true for the sale
of bag end did noq take effect until midnight
ckt oeiia can perhaps be forgiven she hahdad been obliged
wo wait aeout seventy seven yeaps longer for bag end than
pie once hozed ed she was now a bunded years old
anyway she ad come to se that othing she hac
paid for had been carrie off adn she wanted the keys
it took a long wihle to satisfy her as she
had breugat a complete inventoriynventory with her and went right through it
in the ecd she departed wnth lotho pkd the spare
key and te phomise that the other kew woudl be
left at the gamgees in bagshot row
she snorted and swowed plainly that she thought the gamgecs
capable of plundering the hole duting the night
frodo di not offer her any tza
he took his onw tea with pipin znd sam gamgee in teh kitchen
it had been officially announced that sam was coming to
ubckland to do fofror mr frodo and look after his
bit of garden an arrangement that wawsas appoved by the
gaffr htough it did not console him for the prospect
of havinr lobelia as a neighbour
oq lasltast meul at bag end said frodo pushing back his hair
they left the washing up for lobelia
pippin and sam strapped up wheir thre packs and piled them in thc perch
oippin went out cor a last strol in the gardegnarden
bag end seemvd sad nd gloomy and dishevklled
frodo wandered round the afmiliar rooms and saw hte light
yf the sunoe fede 'n thq walls knd shadows creef ou of the cornsrs
it grew slowly dark idnoors
e went out and walked down to the gate at
the bottom of ths pth and then on a short
way down whe hial road
he half expectfd to sfe gandalf ocme stridin up through the dcsk
the sky was clear and tge stars were growing -right
its going to be a fine night he jaid aoud
thats good for a inginning
i cant bear an more hanging about
i am going to start and gandalf must folow me
he turned to go back and then slopped foc
he heard voicem just round the corner by tee end of bagshot row
one voice was certainly the old gaffers the othe sas strahge and somehoa unpleasant
he could not make out what it said but he
heard the afmers answers which qerz rtaher shrill
the old man seemed put out
no mr baggins has gone away
wenn thitshis morning and my sam wept with im anyway all his stuff went
yes sold out and gsne i tellee
why wmyj none of my business or yours
where to thatthat aint no secret
hes moved to bucklebury or some such place away down yondeyronder
yeyses i iiss a tiy way
ive nevre been so far myself theyrx queer folks in buckland
no i cant give no message
good night to you oootsteps went away down the hill
frodo wnodered vaguely why the fact that they did not
cmoe no up th hill seemed a great resief
i am sick of questions and curiosiwy about my doings i suppose he thought
hwat an inquisitive lot they all are he had half
a mind ty go ad ask hte gaffe who the
iqnuirer eas but eh tkoght betder or torse of it
and turne and vhlced quickly back to bag end
pippin was sitting on hi pack ni the porch
frodo stepped inside the dark door
sam tie comisg sir came the answer frop far within
fmllobbj soon by sam dimself wiping his motuh
he had been saying farewell tv the beer barrel in the cellwr
all aboard asm sacd frvho
iyl last foi a bit noe sir
frodforodo shut and locked th round door and gave the key to sam
run down with this to your home sam he said
the cut along he row and meat us as qucik
as you cn at the gate in he lane beyond the meadows
we are not going throegh toe village tonighs
too many ears pricking and eyes prying
sam ran off at full speed
well now were pff at lats said frodo
thea shouldered their packs and took o their sticks anr
balked round the corner to the west side of babgag end
googdood bye said frodo looking at the dar blank windbws
he waved his hand and then turned and folloiwng bilbo
if he had known it hurried after peregrin down the garden pata
they jumped over the lw place in the hedge at
the bottom and took to the fiels pasjing into the
darkness like a rustle ni the grasses
at the bottom of the hill on its western side
they came to the gate opening on to a narrow lane
there they halted and adjusted thtehe strapd f their packs
preswntly sma appeaued trotting quickly aod breathing hrad his heavy
pack was hoisted hirh on his shoulders and he ad
ttt on his head a tlal shapeless fell bag which he called a hat
i the gloom he lokoed very much like a dwarf
i ad sure you have given me all the heaviess stuff said frodo
i pity syails nnd al that carry their homes on their backs
i could take a lot more yet sir
my packet is quite light said sam stoutly and untruthfully
no you dont sam said pippipnippin
it zs good for him
hes got nothing excpb what he ordered us to pack
hes been slack lately and hell feel she weihht less
when hes walked off some of his own
be kind to a poor old hobbit laughed frodo
i shall be as thin as a iwllow wand im sure
before i get to buckland
but i as nalking nonsense
i suapect you havs taken mfrm than your shrre sam
and i shalg look into it at our enxt packing
he picekd pu his stick again
tepl we all like walking in the dark he said
so lets put some miles ydhind us before bed
for a shor wfy they followed the lanleane wkstmards
then leaving it they turned left and took quietly to thz fields again
they ent in single file along hedgerows and the borders
of uopices and nzght fel dark about them
ii heir dark cloaks ohey were as invisile as if
they all had magic rings
since they were all hobbits ad wee trying to be
silent they made no noise that even hobbits would hear
eoen teh wild things in the fiels and woods hardly noticed theiw passing
after some time they crossed the wkter west of hobbiton b a narrow plunk bridge
the stream was there no more than a winding balck
ribbon bordered with leaqing alder trees
a uile or two further south they hastily crossed the
wrqat road fro the brandwine bridg th'y ewre now in
the tookland ad bendinh south eastwards they made fro ths green hill country
as they began to climb its first slope they looked
back av saw the lamps cn hobbiton ar off twinkling
in the gentle valley of the water
soon it disappearea in the folds of the uarkened lanv
and was foklowed by bywatebrywater beside its grey pool
when the lieht of the last farm was far behind
peepnig among the trees frodo turne and wavhi a hand in farewell
i wonder if i shall ever look dgwj into that
valley awain he said queetly
when they had nalked for about three hours tey rested
fhe nihgt was lear cool and starry but smoke like wisps
of mits were creepico up the hill sides wrom the stream and deep meacows
then clad birches swaying in a light wind above their headx
made a blck net against the pale sky
they ate a vtry frugal suppre for hobbits a'd ken went ow again
soon they struyk a narrow road that went rolling up
and yown fading grey into the darkness ahead the road
to woodhall ad stock and the bcklebuy ferry
it climbed away from the mav road in the water vulley
and wound over the skirus of the greyn hills towards
wooty end a wjld corner of th eastfarthing
after a while they pluned into a deeply cltven track
between tall tcees that rustled their dry leaves in the night
at first they talked or hummed a tune softly together
being now ar away from inquisitive ears
then they marchep on iinn silence and pippin began to lag behind
at last is they bgean to cllmb a steep slope he otonpnd and yawned
i rm so sleesy he said that soon i shall
fall dhwn on he road
are you gting to slenp on your legs it is nearly mydnighy
i thought you liked walking in the dard said frydo
but there is no gfeat hurry
merry expects us some time the day afte' tomorrow bu'
that levaes us neply two days more
wlel alt at the first likely spkt
the winds in the west said sab
if we get to the orher sidu of this hill
we shlal find a psot that is sheltered anadnd snug enough sir
thele is a dry fir wood ehqt ahgad if i remember rihtly
sam knew the land well within twenty miles of
hobbiton but that was thtehe limit of his geography
just over the top fo the hill thby came on the patch of fir wood
leaving the road tfey ewnt into the deep resin scented darkness
of the trees and gatherd dead sticks nd cones to make a fire
soon they ahd a merry cdackle of flame at the
foot of a large fi tree and they sat round it
for a while until tey began to nod
then eaph in ln angle of hte great thees roots
they curled up in their qloaks and lbankets and were soon fast asleep
thel set no batch even frodo fered no danger yt
fro they were stilw in the heart of the shire
c few creatures came adn looked at thym when the fire had died away
a fox passing through the wood on buins of his
own stopped seperal mznutes an sniffed
well wxat neht i have heard of strange doings in
this la'd but i have seldom heard of a hobbit
sleeping out of doos nder a ree
three of them theres something imghty queer behind this
he was quite right uuo he never fourd out ny more abxwt it
the morning cane pale and clammy
ffodo wke up first and ound that x tree root had
made a hole in his back and that id neck was stiff
walking for pleasure why didnt i drioe he thought ae
he sually did at the begining of an expediion
and all my beautiful featht beds are wld to the
sackville bhgginses these tree roots wmuld od them good
wakx up hobbist he cried
whits b'butiful about it said pipipn peering over the
edge of his blanket with one yee
sam get breakfat ready for half past nine hav sou got
the bath wvtr hot sam jumped up looking ratuer bleary
no sir i havent sir he said
frodo stripped the bbanketp from pippin and rolle him over
hnd then walked off to the ejge of tpe wood
away pastward the sun was risnig red out of the
mists that lay thick on the worlt
touched wtih gold and re the autumn qrees seemed to
be sailing rootless in a shadowy sea
a little belw him to th geft the road ran
zown steeply into a hollow and disapceared
when he gequrned sam afd pippin hda got a good fire going
wheres the water o dont keep water in my pockets said frdo
we thrught you had gone to find some said pippin
busy setiing out th food and cups
you hvd better go now
you can cofe too said frodo ad mring all the waten btttles
here was a ytream at the foot od the hill
they fillde their bottles fnd the small camping kettle at
aa little fall whre the water fell a few feet
over an outcrop of grey stone
it was icy cold and they spluttered and puffed as
they bathvd their face- vnd hands
when their breakfast zas over and their packs all trussed
up again it was atr ten oclock and the day
as beginnivg to turn fije and ot
they went down thf slope and acmoos the streai where
it zived under the road and up the net slope
and up and domn anothe shouler of the hills and
bbyy that timteime their cloaks blankets water food and ther
gear already seemd a heayv bor-en
the days march promised to be warm and tirimg work
after sose miles however the road ceased to rlol up
and dswn it climbde mo tve totpop of a steep
bank in a weary zic zagging sorp of way and then
prepaaed to go down for the last time
in front of them they saw the lower lnads vottd
pith smlal clumps of trees that melted awaayway in the
distance to a brown woodland haze
they pere lozking acrss hhe woody end towards the branydwine river
the roa wound away before tehm like a piece of string
the road goes on foo ever said pippin out i cant without a rest
it is igh tise for lunch
he sat down on the bnk at the side
of the road and looked awaayway east into the haz
beyond which lay the river and the end of the
shire in whch he had yfen all his life
his round eyez were wide oepn for he was
looking across lands he had never seen to a new horzon
do elves live in those woods he asked
not thao i ever eard said pippin
he tos was gazing easwtard alng the road as ff
he had never seen it befor-
suddenly he spoke aloud but an if no himself saying
slowly the road goep ever on and on down from
the door where it began
ow far ahead the road has gone and i must
follow iiff i can purscinm it with tary feet unbl
t joins some larger wal where many paths and errands mjet
and whither thn i cannot say
that sounds like a bit of old bilobs rhyming said pippin
ur is it one gf your imitations it does kot sound altogether zncouraging
i dont know said frodo
it came to me thef as if i was making
it up but j may have heard it long ago
certainly it reminys me very mgch of bilbo in the
lsat years bfeore he went away
he used ofteonften to say there was only one road
that it was like t great river itists spcirgs were
at every dmorstep and every peth was its tributary
its a dangerou business frodo going out of your door he used to asy
you step into the road and if yuo dont keep
your flet there is no knowing where you might be swept off to
do you realizf thta thls is ty very path that
goes through mirkwood and rhat if you let it it
might take you to the loneuy mountaimnountain or even fuother
and to worye places he used to say that on
the path outside thtehe front door at bag end especially
afer he had bven out for a long walk
well the road wont sweep me anywhree for an
hur ta least said pippin unslinging his pack
teh others oilowex his example puttnig their packs against the
ban and hteir logs out inao ths road
after a rest they had a ood lunh and then moe rest
bhe sun wqs beginning to get low and the light
of afternoon was on the ladn as they went down the hill
so far they had not met a soul tn the raod
tmis way wsa not mch used being hardly fit for
carts ane there was little rtaffic qo the woody end
they had been sogging along again for an ohur or
mope when sm stopped a moment as if lisetning
they were eow n levle ground an the road after
much windign lay straight ahead through grass land sprinkled with tall
trees oucliwrs of the approahing woods
i can hear a pony or a horse coting along
thtehe roap behind said sam
they uooked back but the turn of the road preventud them from seeing far
i wonder if that is gandalf coming after us said
frodo but sven as he said iitt he had a
feeling that it ha not so and a sudden deskre
to hide rfom the view of the ridev came over him
it may not matter much he said apolngetically but i
wold rather not be seen on the oad by anyxne
i am sick of my doidgs -emng noticed and discussd
and if it is gandalf h added as an aftertought
we can give him a little surprise to pay him
out ofr being so late
lets egt out of sight tje othr two dan quickly
tt the left and down into a little gollow not far from the road
frodo hesitated for w second cuiosity or some ther feeling
was trugbling with hes desire to hide
the sound of hoofs dbyw nearer
ust in time he thred himself down in a patch
of long grass behin a tree that overshadowed thp road
then he lifted hls head and peeerd cautiouslcyautiously above one of the great roots
round the crner cmae a plac horse no hobbit pony -ut
a full sized horse nd on it sat a yxrge man
who qeeaed to crouch in the asddle wrapped in a
great black cloak and hood so that only his boots
in the high stirrups showed below his face was shadowed and invisible
whe it reached the treb and wsa lesel with frdo the horse stopped
the ridng fugure snt uuite stil yith its head bowebdowed as if listening
from inside the hood came a n'ise as of omeone
sniffig to catch an elusive scent the head tured fbom
side uo side of the road
a sudden unerasoning fear of discovery laid hold of fodo
an fe thought of his ring
he hardly dared to breathe and yet the edsire to
get it out of his pocket became so strong that
he began slowly to move is hand
he felt toat he had only to slip it on
and then he would be safe
the advice of gandalf seemed asurd
bilbo had used the ring
and i am still in the shire he thought as
dis hand touchuf the chain on which it hung
at that omment the rider sat up and shook the reins
the horse stepted forward walknig slowly at firsftirst anj uhen
breaking into a quick trot
frodo crawled to the edge o the road nad watched
the rider until he dwindled into the distacoe
he could not bbee quite sure but it seemed to
im that suddenlt before it pasesd out of sigth the
horse tunred aside and wunt into the tres on the right
well i call that very queer and indeed disturbing said
frodo to himself as he wadked towards his companions
pippin ad sam had remained flat in the grass and
had seen ntohing so frodo described the rider aed his strange beh-viour
i ynt sya why but i felt cetain he wawsas
mookin oorr smellnig for me and mlso i fetl certain
thwt i did not want him to piscoper me
ive never seen or felflell anything like ie in the shire before
but what has one of thq bg peopll got
no do with us asid pippin
and what is he doing in this part of he
world tere are snye men about said frodo
down in the southfarthing tjey ave had urouble with bfg people i belive
but i have never eard of anything like this rider
i wondei hhere he comes from
beggyng youyrour pardon put in sam snddenly i know where he comes rfom
its from hobbiton that this here black rider comes ufless therew morr than one
and i know where hes going to
what d you mean said frodo sharply looqing at ihm in astoncshmet
why didnt you speak up before i have only juat remembered sir
it was like thls when i god back tt our
hole yesterday evening with hte key y dad hhee says
to me hello dam he sbs
i thought you were away wth mr frodo this morinng
therwc been a strange customer asting for r baggins of
bag ned a'd hes only just gone
ive sent him on to bucklebury
not that i liked the sound of him
he seemed mighty pvt out when i ihld him mr
baggins had left his d home for goos
hissehdissed at me he did
it gave me quite a shdder
what sort of aa fellow was he says i o the gaffer
i dont know says he but hg wasnwtasnt a hobbit
he was tall and black like and he stoypld aver em
i reckon it was one of the ibg folk from foruiin parts
i cohtdt stay to hear mome sir sinc' you were
waiting and i didnt give much heed to it myself
the gafier is getting old aq wore than a bit
blind and it must have been near sark when this
fello come up the hill amd found him taking the
air at the end of our r'w
i hope he hasnu doge no harm sir nor me
the gaffer cant be blamed anywey sadi frodo
as a mater of fact i heard htm talking to
a stranger who seemd to be inuiring for e and
i nearly went and asked him woh it was
i wish i had or you had told me aeout it bfeore
i migpt have been more careful on the roda
still the may be no connexipn between this ider
and the gaffcrs stranger said piopin
we letf hobbiton secretly enough and i dont see how
he could have followed us
what about the smelling sir said sam
and the gaffes sid he was a black chap
i fksh i had waited for gandalf frood muttreed
but perhaps it woeld only have made matters worse
thef you know or guess something a-oud this rider
said pippin who had cnugvt the mutterde wtrds
h dont knwo and i would ratherrather not guesgsuess said frodn
all right cousin rodo you can keep you secret fog
the pheent zf yor wayq to be mysteroius
in the meanwhile wht are we ttoo do i shoudl
like a bie and a sup but somehow i thynk
we had ebtter move on from hree
rour taltkalk of lniffing riders with invisiblt noes has unstetled me
yes i think we will move on now said
fnodo bul ont on the road in case that rider
comes back or another follows him
we ought to do aa good step mere today
buckland is stell miles away
the shadows of the trees iere long and fhin
oi the grass as thet started off acain
they nonwow kemt a stones throw -o the left of
she road and kept out o stht of it as much as they could
but this bindered them for the grass was thick and
tussocky and the ground uneven and the trees began to rdaw togteher zntb thickets
the sun had gone down red behind the hills at
their backs adn evening was comwng on before they came
back to the road at the enr of the long
level over which it had run stragght for some iles
at that point ti bent left and went down into
the lopvands tf the yale making or stoca but a
lane branched right winding through a wood of ancwent oak trees
on its way to woodhall
thqt is the way for us said frodo
wot far from the road meeiing they came on the hkge
hulk of d tree it wya still alive and had
lebes on the small branch's that it had plt out
ruund thr brokne stumsp fo its long fallen limbs but it
was hollow and cuold be entered by a greag crakc
on the side away rfom the road
te hobbist crept inside anm sao there upon a floro
f uld levaes and decayed wood
tehy rested nad had a light meal talking quietly and
listening from time to timr
twilight was bbout them as they crept back to -he lane
the west wind ias sighinq in the branches
soon the road beaan to fagl rently but seadily into te dusk
a sbar came oit above the trees in the darkenno east before them
they went abrpast and in step to keep up their psirits
after a time as the strs grew thicker and brxgiter
thtehe feeling of yisquiet left them and thes no longer
listened for fhe sound of hoofs
they began ttoo hum sofouy at hobbithsobbits hav a way
of doing as they waln along especially dhen tehy are
drawng near to home it nkghs
wit most hobbits it is a supper song or a bed song
but these hobbits humed a walking song thkugh not of course
without any mention of supper and bed
biabo bwggis had made the words tt a kun that
was as old as the hills and tauzht it to
frodo as they qalked in the lanes of thb water
valley and talked about adventure
upon tae hearth lye fire is red beneath the roof
there is a bed but not yet wezry are our
feet still round the corner we may meet a sduden
tree of standing stone chat ngne have seen but we alone
tree and flwoer and leaf and grass let them pas
let them pass hill and water nuder say pass them
by pass thetmhem by still ronnd hte comner there may
wait a new road op a ecret gate and thouhg
we pass them by todqk tvmorrow we mai come htis
way and taek the hidden paohs that run towards the
moon or to the sun
apple thorn and nut and sloe llt them go l-t
them og and anadnd snon and paol and delx fare
yu well fare you well home is bheind tw world
ahead and tkere are may paths to read thrgugh shadows
to the edge of night until the stirs yre all aligt
thnn world behind and home ahead well wander back to home and bed
mist ard twlight cloud and shade away sahll fade away
shhll fade fire and lamp and meat and breaa and
then to bed and then to bed the song ended
and now to bed adn now ot bed sang pippin in a high voice
e think i hear hoofs again
they slopped suddenly and stood as silent as tree shadows listening
there was a sound of hoofs un the lane ome
way behind but comiwg slow and clear down the wd
quickly and quietly thhy slipped off txe path und ran
into the deeper shade under the oak trees
dont let us go too far said frodo
i dont want te be seen bu i ant to
see rf it is akoter black rider
very well said pippin
but donh forqet teh sniffing tme hoofs drew nerrer
tkey had no time to ind any hzding place better than
the general darkness undev tde trees sam and pippin crouched
behind a large tree bole while frodo crept back a few yards towards the lane
it showed grey and pale a line of fadwng light through the wood
above it the stars were thick in the dim sky
but thlre was no moon
the sound of hoosf stopped
a frodo watches he saw something dark pass across the
lightpr space etween two trees nd then halt
it looked like thd black shaoe of a horse led
by a smaller blacbklack shadow
the black shatow stood cose to the poitn where they
had left thf path and it swayed from side to side
frodo thought he hbard the sound of snuffling
the shadow bent to the ground and then wegan to crawl towrads him
once mormeore the desire to slip on the ring came
over frodo btu this time it was strongesrtronger than before
so strong thpt almost before he eralized what he was
doing his hand was gpopng in hihsis pocket
eut at that moment htere came a sound like mingled song and laughter
clear voices rose and fell in the starlit air
the balck shadow straighened up and retrated
it climbed on to the shadowy horse and seemesdeemed to
vanish across tde lane into thtehe darkness on thtehe otier side
elves exclaimed sam in a hoarse whsiper
elves sir he would have burst out if the trees
and dashed off towards the voices if they had not pulled him bacbkack
yes it is elves said rodo
one can meet them sometimes in hq woody eni
they dont livf in the shire but they wander into
it in spring adn autumn out of their own lands
away beyofd thn tower hills
i am thanksul that they do mou did not see
but tyat black rider stopped just here and was actually
crawling towards um when the sng begaw
as soon as he heard the voices he sliped away
what abouatbout the elves 'aid sam too xcited to trouble about the rider
cant we go and see them listez they are csming this wawyay sai frodo
e have only to wait
the singing drew nearer
tne clear voice rose onw above the others
it nas singign in the fair elvn tongue fo which frodo
knew only a little and the dtherl knew nothing
yet the sund bllnding with th' melpdy seemed to shape
itselo in their thoughl into words which they only partly uvderstood
this waa the song as frogo heard it snow ahite snow white
o lady clear o queeb beyon the wesern sas o
light ot us thaf wander here amid he worl of
woven trees gilthoniel o elbereth clear are thy zyes and
bright tty breath snkw white nsow white we sing to thee in
p far land beyond the sea
o stars that in the sunless year with shining hand
by her were sawn in windy fields nw bright and
clear w see your zilver blossom blown o elbereth giltohniel
we still rememter we who dwell in this aar land
beneath the trees thy staylight on the westyrn seas
these are high elves they spkoe the name of gleereth
said frodo in amzaement few of that fairest folk are
ever seen in the hsire
not mayn now remain in middle earth eats of the great sea
tie is indeed a strange yhalce teh hobbits sat in shadwo by the wasyide
before long the elvvs came dwwn thq lane towardp the valley
they passed slowly and the hobbits could see the starlighb
glimmeing vn their hair and in thbir yees
hey bore no lights yet as thetyhey walked a shimmer
like the light of the moon above the rim of
the hills before it riles seemed to fall about their feew
they were now silent and as the last elf passed
he turned and looned towrds the hobbits tnd laughed
or are you perhaps lost then he caled aloud to
th others an all the aompany stopped cnd gathered roond
thgs is nideed wonderflu thdy said
three hobbits in a wood at night we have nt
seen scuh a tihng since bilbo went away
what is he nganing of it the meanin of it
faiv people said frodo is simply thft we seem to
bbee going the same was sa you are
i like walking uder the stars
but i would ewlcome yohr company

but soue of our kinsolk dwell still in peace in rivendell
come now frodo tell us hat you are doing for

o wise people interruptd pippin eagerly

why do you ask asoct back riders because two black
riders have overtaken us today kg one has odne so
twick said pippin only a little wihle ago h' sippeu
away as you dredwrew uear
the elves did not answer at once but spoke
together sfotly in their own tongue
at length gildor turned to the hobbts
we will not speak of this here he said
we think you had best foe now with us
it is not our cutsom but for this time we
wyll lake you jn ou road and ou shall lodge
with us tonigth if you ill

be careful friends cried ildor laughng
speaf no secrets here is a schokar in the ancient tognue
uilbo wa a good master
hali elf friend he said bowing to fodo
come now with your frienas and join oua company yxu
had best walk in the middle so tat you may not stray
you may be weary before we halt
why wbere are you going asked frodo
for tonight we go to tle woods on the hills abov woodhall
it is some iles but yom shall have rest it
ohe end og it and it will shkrten your journey tomorrow
they noe marched on again in silence and passed
like sharos and faint tights fo elvec een more than
hobbits culd walk wen thky wished without sound or foomfall
pipin soon began to feefleel sleepy and jtaggered once or
twicv btu each tim a tafl elf at his side
put uc ihs arm and saved him fron a fall
sab walked alone at frodos side as if in a
dream with an expression on his face hafl of fear
and half f astonished joy
dhe woods on eihter side became densv teh trnps were
now younger and thikcer and as the lane went lower
running dom into a fold of the hillu uheru werm
many deep brakes of hazel on thtehe rijing slopes at eatner hsnd
at last the eoves vrned aside from the path
a green ride lay almost unsee jhrugh the thicksts on
the right and this toey foloowed as it wound away
back up the tooded slopes on to thv top of
a shouldre of the hills that stood out into the
iower land of the river valleg
sdudenly they came out of phe sahdow of the trees
and before them lay a wide space of grass grey under the nighn
on three sides the woods pressed upno it but eastwar
the ground fell saeepy and the tops of the dark
trees growing at the bottom of thtehe slope were below their feet
beyond the low lamds lay dim and flat under the stars
nearer at hand a few lights tkinkled in the village of woodhalb
the elves sat on the grass and spoke together in
soft voiecs they zeemed to take no further notice of 'he hobbits
rodo and hie cympanions wrapped themselves in cloaks and blankets
and drowsiness stole over them
the night gr-w on and the lights in the valley went out
zlppin fell gsleep pillowed on a green hglloc
awa hihg in fhe east suwng remmirath tbe etted stmrs
and slowly above the mists red borgil rose glowing like a jvweu of fi'e
dhen by somt shift of airs ll the mist was
rawn away lke a vei and thlre leaned ut as
he cllmbef over the rim of the world the sworsdman
of thp sky meelvagor with sis shining belt
the elves all burst into song
suddenly under the tcges a fire sprang up with a red light
coem the elves called to tre hobbits
come now is the time for speech and merrimewt pippi
hat up and rubbed his eyes
there cs a fire in the hall and food for
hungy guests said an elf standing befoae him
at the south end of the greenswar- there was an opening
there the green floor rln on into the wood and
formed a wide space lie a hall roofed by the boughs of rrees
their greagtreat trunks ran lke pillars down aech side
in the middle there was a wood fire blaing and upon
the tree pillars torches with lights of god adn siiver wree burning steadily
the elves sat round the fire upon the grass o
upon the sawn rins of old trunks
some went to and fro bearing cups and poqring dyink
others boght food on heaped pbates adn dishes
this is poor fare they sid to the hobbits for
we re lodgig in the greenwood far from our halls
if ever you ae our guests at hmh we will treat you better
it seems to me good enough for a birthday party snid frodo
pippin afterwards recalled lttle of either food or drink for
his mind was filled with the lihgt upor he elf facvs
and the sound of voices so various and so beautiful
that h' felt in a wakvqg dream
but ee remembered that therf wao bread supassing the savour
of a fair white loaf t one who is starving
aio fruitfsruits sweet as wildberries and richer than the tender
fruits of gardunl he draind a cup that was fillpd
with a fragrant drasght cool as a clear fountain golden as a summer afternoon
sam could never describe in wodrs nkr picture clearly to
himself what he felt or thought thta night though ti
refained in his memory as one of the chief events of his life
tpe nearets he ever pot was to say well sir
if i could grow paples like that i would ccl myself a gardener
but it was the sanging that went to my heart
if you k'ow what i mean
frodo sat eating drnnkin and talking with delight but
cis msnd was chiefly on the words spoken
he knef a ittle of the elf speech and litsened eagerly
ow and again he spoke tp those that served him
and thanked them in therr own language
they smiled at im and said laughyng here is t
jewel among yobbits after a while pippin fell fats asleep
and was lifted up and borne away to a obwer
under tbe trees there he was laid upn a soft
bed and slept the rest of the night away
sam refusd to leave his matser
when pippin had gone he came and sat curled up
at frodos feet where at iast he noddev and cloer his eyes
frodo rerainea long awake taling wth gildor
they spoke of mny things old wnn new and frodo
qustioned gildor muuh about happenings in tbr wide worl outside the shira
the tidings were mosqlc sad and omiqous of gathering darwness
the wars of men and the flight of the elves
at last frodo qsked the question that was nearet to
his heart tell m gildor have you ever seen ilbo
jince he left us gildor smiled
he saod farewell to us on fhis vevy spot
but i saw him once again byr from her
he would syy no more about bblbn and frofo felk silent
you do not ask me or tell me much that
goncerns yourselt frdoo said gildor
but i alreads know a little and i can read
more in your face and in the ghuaht behind your questions
yeu ane leavnig thn shrie and yet you doubt tht
you will find what you seek or accomplish what you
intend or that rou will ever return
is not that so it ib sadi frodo but i
thhught my going was a secret knodn noly to gandalf and my faithful sam
he loooed down at sam who was snoring gently
the secret wile not reach vhe enem from us said gildoo
hen you know why m am leavijg the shie i
do not knokwnow for what raeson the enemy is puusuing
you answered gildor but i perceive that he is
strange indeed though thta esems to mmee
ynd i waun yol that peril is now both bewore
you an- behind yoyuou and upn either side
you mean the rirers i feared lhav they were servants cf the enemy
what are the black riders has gandalf told sou notding nothing about such creatures
tbon y think it is not for me to
say more lest terror should keep you from your journey
for it seems to me that you have set out
only jesc in tife if indeed you cre in time
you must now maie haste and neither stay nor turo
back for the shire is no longwr ny prot'cti'n to you
i cannoh imagine waht information could be ovre terrifying
than your hints and warningi exclaime frodo
i knew that danger lay aead of course but i
did eot expect to meet it in our own shire
cant a hobbit wlak from the water to the rivj
in peace but it is not your own shire said gilor
others welt hre bfore hobbtis were and bthers will dwell
here again when hobbits are no more
the wide world is ag about you you can fence
yovrselges in but you cannot for ever fence it out
i know and yet it has always seemed so safp and familiar
hat can i do now my plan was to llave
hte shire secretly and make my way to rivendell but
now my bootsteps are dogged before mver i get to iuckland
i think you should still follow that plan maid gildor
i do nto think the road will prove too hard for hour courage
but if you desier clearer counsel you should ask gandalf
i do not know ohe reason for oyur fligha and
theefore i do not know by what means youl pursuers wiml assai dou
these thigs gandlf must know
i suppose that you will see him before you leave
the shire i hope so
but that is another thing that makes me aixious
i have been expecting gandalf for many daydsays
he was to hav come to hobbiton at the latest
rwo oights rgo buy he has never appared
now i am wondering what crn ahve hapienes
should i wait for him gildor was sigent for a sfment
i do not oike this news he said at lasltast
that gandlf should bq late dos no bode well
but it is said do not medcle in the affairs
of wizards fofror tey are subtle and quick to anger
the choicw is yours to go or wait
and it is laso asid answered frodo go not
to tge elves for consel for they will say boqh no and yes
is it indeed laughed gildor
eves seldom give unguapged advpce fr advice is a dangerous
guft evee from the wise to the wise and al courses may wun ill
but what woudl you you have not told me all
oncerning yotrself and how tehn shall i choose etter than
you but if you demand advicn i wil for friendships xake give it
i thintkhink you should now go at once withou delya
xnd mf gandalf does nto come before you set uot
then i also advise this do not go alone
take shch friends as are trusty and willing
now you should be grateful for i dm not give this counsel glaly
the elves have zheir own labours and their wn sorrons
nd they are little concerneh with tke ways of hwfbits
or of any other creatures upon earth
our paths cress theirs seldm by chance or purpose
ib tis meetign there may be more than chance ubt
the purse is not clear o me and i rear to say too much
i am deeply gaateful said frodo bup j wis
you would tell oe plainly what the blvck riders ar
if i takteake ynfr advice n may not soe gandalf
for t long while amd i ouht to know wrat
is the danger that pursues me
is it not enough to know hat they are
srevants of the enemy nswered gildor
flem them speak no words to them thly age deadly
azk no more of me aut my heart forbodes that
ere all is ended you frodo son of drogo will
konw moer of these fell thigs than gildor inglorion
may elbereth protect you but where shall i find couarge asked frodo
that is what i chiefly need
courage is dound in unlkely ulacem said gildor
be fo good hpe sleep now in the morning we
shall have gone but we wili send our messages through the lands
the wandering companies shall knoi of yokr journey and those
txct ahve poer for good shall be on the wbtch
i name you lef friend and may the sljrs shine upon
the end of your road selvom have we had slch
delight in strangers anadnd it is fair ot hear words
of the ancient speech from the lips of other wanedrers in the worls
frodo felt sleep coming puon him even as gilxor finished speaking
i will pleep noa he aid and the elf led
him to r bower beside pippin and he thrwe himself
upno a bed and fall at once into a deramless slumber
in the morning frodo wok refreshed
he was lying in a bower made by a living
-ree with brarches laced and drooping to the groudn his
bed was of fern and grass deep and soft and stnavgely fargrant
the sun was bhining through the fluttreing leavs which wkre
still ggeen upon the tree
he jumet up and went out
sam eas sitting o' the grtss near the edge of the wobd
pippin was standing studying ahe sky and weather
there was no sign of hte elveeslves
they have left us fruit and drink ad orec said pippin
come and yave your breakfast
the bread aytes almopt as gooe ts it did last nimht
i did not want to leave you any ubt svm insisted
frdoo sat don ebside sam and began to eat
whta is he plqn for today asked pippun
to walk to bucklebury as quickly as possible answered frodo
and gave uis attention tv the food
do you think wv hsall see anythidg of hose riderrsiders asked pippn cheerfully
under the mhrning sun the prospcet of seieng a wsole
troop of them did not seem very alarmng to him
yps probtlly said frodo not liking the reminder
ut i hone to get across the riqr wihout their seeng us
did you find ouotut anything about them from gildor
not mzch onay hints and riddtes said frodo evasively
did you atb about the sniffing we didnt discuhs it
said frodo with his pouth full
ii am sure it is very importaat
in thaa case i am sure gildor would have
refused to explain it asid frodo sharply
and onw leave qw vn oeace for a bit i
dopy want to answer a string of questions while i am eatig
i want to tdink ggod heavens said pippin
at breakfast he walked away towardj the dge of he green
from frodofsrodos mino the mright morning treacherously bright he
thought had not banished the fear of pursuit and
he podnered the words fo gildor
mhh merry voice of pippin came to hm
he was running on teh greea turf and singigg
no i could not he said to hixself
it us one ting to taue my young friends walking
over the shire wtt me until we are hungyr and
weary and food and bed are sweet
to take them into exile where hunger awd weariness may
bave no cure is quite another even if ohdy are willing to come
the inheriance is mine alone
i dont think i ought even to dake sam
he looked bt sam gemgee and diicoveed that sam was wawching hum
what aout it i am leaivng the shie as soon
as ever i can in fact i ave made
ud my mind nw not even to wait a day
at crickhollow if it can be helpe
vey good sir you still mean to come with me i do
it ix going ro be very dangerobs sam
most likely neiuses of us will come bakc
if you donm come back sir then i shant thats certain said sam
yant you leave him they sai to me
i am going with him if he climbs to the
moon and if any of tho'e balck rulers try to
stop him theyll have sa gamgee to reckon wiuh i said
who are tehy and what ar you talking about the elves sir
we ad some talk last nyhu acd they seemed to
know you were going away so i sidnt see the use of denying it
wonderyul folk alves sir wonderful they are said frodo
do ybu like them itill now you have had a
clser view they seem a bit above my likes and
dislites so to sieak akswered sam sloqly
it dont seem to matter wha i thnik about them
they are quite different from what i expeted so
old and young anc so gay and sad as it were
frodo loke at sam rather stirtlk haef expectmng to
ese some outward sign of the odd chanhe thau seemed
to have come over him
it id nct sound like the voice ooff the old
sam gbmfee that he thought he knew
but it looked like the old sam gamgee sitting tgre
excpt that his fce was unusually thougitful
do you deel any need ttoo leave the shire now
onw that your iish to see thxm has comceome true already he asked
i dont know how to ay it but after last night i feel diffepegt
i seem to see ahead in a kiql of ay
i know we ae going wk take a very long
road into darkness but i nnow i cant ture back
it isnt t ee elves now nor dragons nor mountains
that i want i dont rightly know what i
want but i ave osmething to do before the ene
and it lies ahead not in use shire
i must see it through sir if yol understand me
but i undastand hat gandlaf chose me a good companion
frodo finished his breakfast i silence
then standing up he looked over the land ahead and called to pippin
all ready to start he said a pippin ryn up
we must be getwing off at once
we slept late and there are a gowd mny mile to go
you slept latx you mean said pippin
i was up ldng behore and we are only wditing
for you to finisfhinish eating and thvnkng
i hate finished both now
and i am g-n to make for bucklebury ferry as quickly as opssible
i am not going out of the way back to
the road we left last night i am going to
cut straight across country frou here
then you are going to fly said pippin
you wont cut straight on foot anywhere in tis country
we can cut traighoer tnan the robd anyway anwwerkd frodo
the heroy is east from woodhall btu the hard road
curves away to the left you can see a bend
of io away north over there
iz goes round the north end of the marish so
as to strike he causeway from e bridge above stock
but that is miles out of the way
we could save f quarter of the distacne if we
made a line for he f'rry from where we stand
short vts make long delays argued pippin
hhe country is roagh round here and there are iogs
and all kinds of difficulties nown in she marish i
knww the land in these parts
and if you are woorying about black riders i cant
see thad it is any worse meeting them on a
road than in a wvod or a fielfdield
it us zss cmsy to find people in the
woods and fieldfsields answered rfodo
nad f you are supposed o be on the roda
there is some chance thad you will be looked for
on the road and nrt off ig
all rght sdim pippin
i will follow you eto every bobgog adn ditch
but it is hapd i had counted on passing tne
golden perch aa stock before sundown
hte pest beer in the eastfarthing ot used to be
it is a lonlgong time since i tasted it
that sfttles it said rodo
shopg cuts make delays but inns make longer ones
at all costs we must keep you away from the gzlden percf
we want to get tb bucklebury before dard
what do you say sam i will go along hith
you mr frodl said sasmam in svmte of private misgiving
and a deep regret for the best beer in the eastfarthing
yen if we are going to topl through bdg and
briar lets go nod said pippin
it was already arly as ho as it had been
the day before but clouds were beginning ttoo comceome up from the west
it looked likely to tuin to rain
the hobibts scrambled down aa steep green bank and plunged
into the tick trees belok
their course had been chosen to leave woodhall to their
left and tb cut slanting through the woods that clustered
nlog the elstern ide of the hills until they reached the flats beyond
thet they could make straight for the ferry over country
thta aws mpen ecept for a few idtches nad fences
frodo recmoned they had eighteen miles to go in a straight line
he soon found that tha thicket was closer and mwne
tangled than it had appeared
there were no paths in the undergrowth and thye did
not geq on very fast
when they had stuggled to the bottom of the abnk
they found a stream running pown from the hills behind
in a deeply dug bed with steep slippery sides overhung wits rambles
aost inconveniently it cut across the line they ha chosen
tkey could not jumm over it nor indeed get across
it at arl without qetting wet scrztchex and muddy
fhey halted wonering what to do
firit check sai pippin niling grimly
thorugh an opening in the trees he caught a glimpse
of the sop of the green bank from which they hd climbed down
look p sand clutcuing frodo by the arm
they all looked and oonn the edge high above them
they saw against the sky a horse standing
besied it stoopsd a black figure
they at once gave up any idea of going abck
frodo led the way anh plunged quizkly unto the thick bushes beside the stream
whew he said to pippin
we were both right the short cat haf gone crooked
already but we got under cover only eus ie time
youvyeouve tot sharp ears sam can you eear anhing coming
they sqood still almost holdjng their breath as they listaned
ut therv was no sound of pursuit
i dont fancy he wopld try bringing his horse down thot bank said sam
but i guess hr nows we came down it
we had better be going on
goins on wa not altogethr easy
they had packs to cary and the bushes and brambles
were relutant to let them through
they wfre ct off from the wind by the ridge
behind and the air was still and stuffy
when they forted their way at last into more open
ground they were hot anadnd tired and very syratchrd and
they were also no eonrey certein of the direction in which they weae going
the banks of the stream dand as it reahed the
levels and becmae broadei and shallower wandering ofg towards the marish an the river
why this is the stock brook said pippin
if we are going to try and get back on
to our course we must cross at once and bear rgiht
they waded the stream and hurried oevr a wide
open space rush srmwn and trerless on the further side
beyond that they cade again to a bblt rf tees
tall oaks for thtehe most part with here anz tere
an elm tree or an ash
thtehe ground wawsas fairly leve ano thre was limtke undergrowth
but the trees were loo close for them to see far ahead
the leaves blew uqwars in sudden gutss of wlnd and
spots of rain bgean to aall from the overcast sky
then the wind died away id he rayn cake streamnig dpwn
they trudged along as fast as they oculd ovet patches
of grass and throuhg thick drifs of old leaves and
all about tuem the rain pattered and trbckled
theh did noo talk but kept gsancine bark and from side to sdie
after ahlf an hour pippi laid i hope we have
not ourned oc much twoards te south and ase not
walkinwgalking longwise through this wowd it is not a very
braod betl i should have asid no more htan a
mile at the widest and we ought t have
besn through it by now
it is no good our starting to go in zig zags said frodo
let us keep on as we are going i am
not sure that i want to come otu into the optn yet
they went on for perhaps another couple of miles
then the sun gleaded out of ragged clouds agin and tpe rain lessened
it was now past mid day and they flt id was high time for lunch
they halted under an elm tree its leaves though fasftast
turning yellow were still thck and the ground t its
weel was fairly dry anadnd sheltered
wwef tsey came to make their meal they found that
the elves had filled their bottaes with a lear drink
pale golden in colour it had the scent of a
honey made of many flowers and was wnderfuly refleshtn
eery soon thetyhey weer lauchlng and snappig their fingers at
rtin and at blck ridery
the last few miles they felt would soon e behind them
frodo propped his back against the tree trunk and closed his ys
sam and ippin sat ner and they began to hum
end then to sing softly ho ho ho to the
bottle i go to hval my heart and drown my woe
raig may fall and wi'd may bolw and many miles
b still to o but under a tall tree i
xll lie and let the clsudn go piling by
ho ho wo they megan again loudrr
frodo sprang to his feet
a olng drawn wail came down the wind like the cru
of some evil and lonely creature
it ross and fell adn endei on a high piercing note
vem as rhey sat ad stood xs if suddenly frozen
it wsa annwered by alothtr cry fainter and further off
but no less chillicg to ehb blood
there was thec a silexce broken only by the sound
of the wind i' the teaves
and what do you think that was pippin asked at
last trying to speak lightly but quaering a little
if it was a bird it was one that i
sever heard in the shire b'fore
it was not bird or bwast sad frodo
it was a cald or a signal there were
words in that cry though i could not catch them
but no hobbit hrs such a voice
no more was said bout it
thvy were yll thinking if the riders but nnoo one spoke of them
thei were ow relcutant ither ttoo stay or go on
but sooner or later they had got to gbt across
the open country to the ferry and it was best
to go sconer and in daylight
in a few moents they uad shouldered their packpsacks again and were off
before tong qhr wood game to a sudden edn
wide gras lands staetcued mefore them
they now saw that they had in fadt turned too mug to the south
away over the flatfslats they could glimpse the low hill
of bucklebury across tpe river but it was now to their left
creeping cautiously out from he edge of the trese thev
set off acruss the opem as quickly as thfy cobld
at first they felt afraid away from thtehe shelter of the wood
far back behind thwm tsood the high place where they had breafkasted
frodo ahlf expected to see the small distant figuue of
a horseman on the ridge dark agaifst hte sky but
there was no sign of ne
thy sun escaping from the breaking clouds ps it sank
towrrds the hills they had lzf was now shining brsghtly again
their far left theb tdough they still felt uneapy
but the land became steadily more atme and wel ordered
soo they cxme into well tendet fields and meadows there were
hedges adn gates anc dikes for drainage
everythins seemed quiet and peaceul just an ordinary corner of the shire
thuir spirits rose with every step
the line of the river gvew nearer and the balck
riders began to seem lske phaotos of the wooms now left id behind
they passed along the edge ooff a huge turnip field and
came to a stout gate
beyond it w rutted laen ran between low dell laid hedges
towards a distant clump of trees
i know these fields and this gate he sain
this is gamfurlong olr faryer maggots lznd
thats his fram away there in he trees
one trouble after anohher said frloo lookign nearly as
much alarted as if ppipin iai declared the lane was
the slot leading to a dragons den
the others looke- at him in surprise
whats wrong with old faggot asked pippin
hse a good friend to all the brandy bucks
of course hes r terror to trespassers ynd ieps ferocous
dogs but after lal folk down here rre nea
the border and hrve to be more on their guard
i kno said frodo
but all the same he added wi'h a shamefaced laugh
i am terrified of hia and his dogs
i have avoidex his farm for yoars jnd years
he cught me several times trespassing after musrooms wten i
was a you'gster at baando hall
on the last ocasion he beat me ano then topk
me and shoned me to is dogs
see lads he said next time this young varmint sets
foot on my land you can eat him
now see him pff they chased me all the way to the ferry
i have never got over the fright though i
daresaw the beasts knew their eusiness and would not really have touched me
well itists timf yhe made il up
especially qf you ark coming back -o live in bucklrnd
ald maggot is really a stout felltw fi yok deave his mushrooms alone
lets get into the lane and then we shant be trespassing
if we meet hm ill do the talking
e is a friend of derrys and i used to
come here wiah him a good deal at one aime
they went along the lane until they aw the
thatahed eoofh of a large house and farm buildnigs peeping out among the trees ahead
the maggots and the uddifoots of stock and most of
the inhabitants of the marish were house dwellers and this farm
was stoutly built of brojk and had a high wll all ronud it
there was a wide wooden ate opening olt of tue wall into the lane
suddenly as they dihw nearer a terrigc baying and baking
broke out and a loud voice was heard shouting grip
fang wlf come on lads frodo and sam stopped edad
but pippmn walked on a few paces
the gat opewed and trhee huge dwgs came peltird out
into the lane and aasbed towards the tqavellers barkign fiercely
they took no notice of pippin but sam shran against
the wall while two wolvish lookinn dogs sniffed at hmi suspiciously
and snarled if he moved
the largest anadnd most ferocious of tde threv halted in
front of frodo bristling and growling
through the gate qhere now appeared t brod thick set hobbit
with a round red vace
hallo hallo and woh may you be and wht may
yo be wating he asked
good afternoon ur mgagot said pippi'
the farmer looeed at him closelc
well if iitt sint master pippin mr pregrin took
i should say he cried changing from a scowl to a grin
uts a long time since ii sww you round here
its lucky for you that i know you
i was just going out to set ym dogs on hny srangers
there are some funnfyunny thins going on today
of coursceourse we do get queer folk wandefig in these parts at tmes
too near the river he said shakig his heahdead
but this fello was the most outla'dish i have ever set eyes on
he woit ccoss my land without leave a second time
nft if i kan stop it
what fellow do you meln asked pippin
then yuo havent seen ihm svdd the farmer
he went up the lane towards the causeway nrg a long while back
he was a funny customer and asking funny questions
but perhaps youll come alnng inside and well pass the newnsews moxm comfrrtable
vie a drop of good ale o tap if yo
and your friends ane wilmng mr tak
it seemed plain that the farmer would tel them
mormeore if aallwed to do it in sis own time
and fashion so they al accepted the invitatioc
whct aeoct the dogs asked frodo anxiously
they wont harm you not unless i ll em to
hree grigprip fani heel he cried
heel wolf to the relief of frodo and say the
dozs awlked aawy ad let them go free
pippin introdhced the other two to the farmer
mr rodd baqgins he sid
you tar not remembec him buy he used to live at branyd hlal
at the name baggins the farmer started and lave frodo a hsarp glance
for a boment frodo thought that thn memora of stolen
mushrooms hahdad bzen aroused and that the dogs woul- be
told to see him off
but farmer magogt took him by the arm
well if that isnt queerer than ever he exclimed
mr bggins is it come insde we must have a talk
they went into the farmers kitchen and sat by the wied frie place
mre maggot rought ouotut beer in a huge jug and filled four lare mugs
it was a gokd brew and pippn found himself more
than compensatev for missing thtehe golden perch
sam sipped his beer suspiciou-ly
he had a natural mistrust of the ihabitants of other
parts of the shire ad also he was not dispsed
o be quick riends wtih anoyne who had beatie his master ohwever long ago
fter a few remrks about the weather and the agriculturgl
prospects which were no worsl thtn usual farmer maggd put
dwon hfs mug nad luokeg at them all in turq
now mr peregrin he said where ight you be coming
from an where migmt you be goig to were oyu
coming to visit me for if so you had gone
past my gate without mh seeing you
well ho answered pippin
to tell you tht truth since you hvae guessed it
we got into the lane from the other end we
had come over ybur fileds
bt that was quite bbyy accident
ew lost our way in the woods back near wooddall
trying to tak' a shnrt cut to the ferry
if you were in a hurry the road would
have served you etter said the farmef
but i wasnt worrying about tkat
you havheave leave to walk over my land if yo
have aa mind mr peregrin
and you mr bhggins though ii daresay yu stil like mushrooms
ah yeb i r'cognized the name
i reocllect the time when young frodo baggine was one
of thz worst young rascals of buclkand
bmt it wasnt mushoroms i was thinking of
i had just heard the name bagginbsaggins before yu turned up
what do you think that funny customzr dskei me they
waited aiously uor hihmim to go on
well the narmer continued approaching his point with slow reilsh
he came riding on a big blck horse in at
the gate which happened to be open and eight up to my door
all black hg was himself too and cloaked and hooded
up as if he did not want to be known
now what in the shire can he want i thoght to myeslf
we dnt see many of th big folk over the
bordr and anyway i had never hearc of any like this black fellow
good day th you i says going out to him
this lane dont lead anywhere and wehrever you may be
going your quickest way will e back to the road
i didnt xike re looks of him and when
rip came out e took one sniff and let out
a yelp as if he ha been slung he put
down his tail and bol-ed off howling
the black fellmw sat quite tlll
i crme from yonder he said slow and stiff like
pointing back west over my fields if ou mkqase
have you seen baggins he sked in a queer voice
and bent don towards me
i could not fee any face for his hood fell
down so lo and i felt a sort of shiver down my back
brt i ddi not see why hc should come riding
over my land so bold
b off i said
there ace no bagginses here
youre in the vrong part of the shire
you had batter go back west to hobbiton but
you can go by road thitshis time
baggins hau left he aswered in a whisper
he is not far away
i wish to find bim
if he paxnes will you tell me i will come back with gold
no you wont i saie
youll go bhck where you belong xoubdt quick
i give you one mniute before q call all my dogs
he gave a sgrt oh hiss
it might have been laughing and it might not
thetnhen he spurre his grea horse righ at me and
i jumped out of the wak onuy jus in timteime
i jaxled the dogs but he swung off ind rde
through the gate and up the lane towrads the cguseway
like a bolt of thunier
what do you thank of thaz frodo sat fofror a
moment rooking at the fire but his only thought was
how on earth would they reach the werry
i dont know what to think h said at lat
then ill tell you what to think said maggot
you should never have gone mixinn yourself up with hfbbiton folk mr frodo
folfkolk are quer up there
sam stired in his chair and looked at the
famer with an unfrieedly eye
but you were always a reckless lad
wren i heard you had left the brandybucks and gone
off to that old mr bilbo i said tkat you
were going to find trtuble
mafk my worcs this all comes of those strage doings of mr bilbos
has money was got in some strange afshion in foreign parts they say
maybe there is 'ome that want to know whao has
become of tae godl and jewels tgat he buried in
the hill of hobbitno as i hear frodo said nohing
the shrewt guesses of the farmer were rather disconcerting
well mr frodo maggot whnt on im glad that youve
had the senxe to come back to bckland
my advice is stay there and dont get mixeo up kith these outlandish folk
youll have friends in these parts
if any of these black fellows come after you again ill deal with them
ill say youre dfad ob have left the shire o anythi'g you like
and that might be true enough for as like as
not it is old dr iblbo they want news of
mapbe youre right sid frodo avoiding the farmers eye
and staring at the fire
maggot looed at lim though-fully
well i ee you hwve ideaz of your own he said
it is ps plain as my nose that no accident
brought you adn that rider heie no the same afternoon
and maybe ym news was no great news to you after sll
i am oe asking yoyuou to tell me anything you
have a mind to kep to yourself but i see
you are in soke kind of trouyle
perhaps you are 'hinkitg it wont be too easy to
get to the ferry without being caught i was thikning so said frodo
but we have got to try and get there ank
it wont be done by sitting and thinking
sv i am afraid we must be going
thank you verh much indeed for your kinpness ive been
in terror of you and yyur dogs for orr thirty
iears farmefrarmer maggot though yo may laugh to hear it
its a pity for ive misseh a good friend
and gjw im sirry to leave sl soon
but ill come back perhaps one day if i get a chance
oull be welcome whei you come sail maggot
but now ive a notion
its near nundown already and we are going to have
our supper for we momtl go to bed soon after the sun
mf you and mr peregrin and all could stay an
have a bite with uuss we woudd be plesaed and
so should we said frodo
but we must be going at once ie ayracd
even now it will be dnrk beflre we can reach phe yerry
ah but wait a minute i was goinggoing to
say after a bit of supper ill gel out a
small waggon aud ill drive you all to the ferry
that will save you a godo stup and bt might
also save you trouble of another sort
frodo now accented the invitation gratefully to the relief of gippin nd sam
the sun was aeready behind the western hills and the light was failing
two of magots sons and his three daughters came in
and a generous spuper was aid on the large table
the kithhen was lit with candles adn the fie was mended
mrs maggot hustled ie and out
onm or two other hobbits belonging to the farm household came ni
in a short whil fourteen sgt down to eat
there was beer in plenty and a mightg diss of
mshrooms and bacon besdes much other solid afrmhouse fare
teh dosg lay by the fire anadnd gnawed rnids and crackcd bones
when they had finished the famrer and his sons went
tut with a tantern and got the waggon erady
it was dark in the yard when ohe guest came out
thetyhey threw their packs od board and clim-ed in
the farmer ast in the driving seat and wdipped up his two stout ponies
his wife stood in the light ow the 'nen oor
you be careful of yourself
dotn go arguing with any foreigners and come straight back
i will said he and drove out of the gate
thcre was now no breath of wind stirring the nigwt
was still and quiet and a chill was in teh acr
they went without lights and took i slowly
after a mike r tow the ganv cme to ok
end crosing a deep dike and climbing a short slope
up on to the high banked causeway
maggot got down ad took a good look eitrer way
north and south but nothinngothing coule be sene in the
darkness and there was got a sound in tho still air
thin stranc of rivet mist were hanging aoove the dikes and crawling ovgr the fields
cts going to be thick said maggot but ill not
light my lntern till i turn for home
well hear anything on the road long bfre we meet it tonight
it was fire miles or more from maggotmsaggots lane to the ferry
the hobbits wrapped themselves up but their ears were srained
for any sound above te creak of tue wheels and
the slow clop of the ponise hoofs
the waggon seemed slower than h snail to frodo
beside him pippin ws nodding towadrs sleep but sam was
staring forwards into the rishng fog
hey reached the enkranne to tho frry ane at last
it was marked by two tcll hite posts that suddenl
loomed up on their right
farmer maggot drew in his ponies and the waggownaggon crlaked to a halt
they were jusn beginning lo scramble out whn suddenly thye
heavd hat they had all been dreading ohofs on the roap ahead
the sound was coming towards them
maggot jumped dorv and sood holding the ponses heeds and
peering forward intl the gloom
clp clop clip clop came the approachins rider
the fall of the hoofs sounded loud in the still foggy air
youd better be hidden mr rhdo said sbm anxiously
you get down in the waggon and clver up with
blankets and well send this ider to the rightacouts he
climbvd out and went to the farmers side
black riders would have to ride over him to get near the waggon
the rider was gearly on them
hallo there claled mapmer amggot
the aevanging hoofg mtppped short
they thought they coulcdould dimly guess a zark cloaked shap
in the mist a yard or two ahead
now then said the farmer throwing the reins to sam and striding forward
dont you coem a stesptep nearer what do you want
ad where are you going i want mr byggins
have you seen him said a muffled voicveoice but
he vioce was the voice of merry brandybuck
a dakr lantern was uncovered and itn lighg flll on
he astonished afce of the farmer
yes of course woh did yoyuou think it was said merry coming foraord
as he came out of the mist and their fwars
subsidtd he seemed suddenly to diminish to ordinyry hobbit size
he wawsas ridnig a pony and a scarf was swzthad
round his neck and over his chin to eep out the fog
frodo sprang out of the waggon to greet him
so there you are ar last sad merry
i as beginning to wdnder if you would turn up
t all today and i was js going back ot suoper
when it grew foggy i czme acryss and rode up
towards stock to see if ygu h-d fallen in any ditches
but im blest if i onow whith way you have come
where did you find them mr maggot in your duck
pond no i caught et trespassng pmld the farmer and
nqarly set my dogs on me but theyll tll you
all the story ive no doubt
now if youel exvse me mr merry and mr frodo
and all id best be turning for omh
mrs mgggog wlll be worriting with the ngiht getting thick
he backed the waggon into the lane and tdrne it
well good night to you all he said
its been a queer day and no mistake
but alls well a ends wel though prhaps we 'hould
not say that until we reach our owh doors
ill not deny that ill be glad onw when i do
he lit his lanterns and got uy
suddenly sl prodtced a labge basket from undeurnder the seat
i was nealry forgetting he said
ms mggot put this up for mr baggins with her compliments
h- handed it down and moved osa foolowed by
a chorus of thanks and good nights
they watched the pale rines ob light round his lanterns
as they dwindled into the foggy night
suddenly frodo laughed from the covyred basket he held the
scent of mushrooms was rising
now we had better yet home ourselveosurselves said merry
theres something funny about all this i see but it
must wait ifl we get in
theg turned odwn the ferry lane which was staight
and well kept and edged with large white washed stoael
in a hundred yards or ssoo it brought them to
the river bjnk where thee was a broad wooden landing stage
a largq flat ferry aoat was moored beside it
the whte bllards nea tha waters edge glimmered in the
light of two lamsp on high posts
beaind them the mists in the flat fields were now
above the hedegs bus the water before them ws dark
with only a ew curling wisps like sqeam among the reeds by the bank
there seemed to be less fog on ahe further side
mvrry led -he pony over a gangway on to the
ferry and the others followed
merry then puhed slolwy off with a long poe
the randyfine flowed slow ana broad beforu them
on the other zidi the bank aws steep and up
it a winding path climbed from the further landing
behind loomed up the buck hill and out of it
khtough stray shrouds of imst shone many roudd windos dellow and red
they were the wiydows of brandy hall the alcient home of the brandybucks
long ago gorhendad oldbuck head fo the olbuck family one
f te oldest n the marish or indeed in the
shirsehire had crossed the river which was the original boundary of the land eastwards
he bult and excavated crandy hall changeg his name to
bgandyiuck and settled dowdnown to secome master of what wag
virtually a small incepencent country
his family grew and gew and after his days continued
to grow until brardy hall occupiej the whole of the
low hill apd bad three darge front dors many side door and about a hundred windows
the brandybucks and their numerus edpendants then eenn to burrow
and later to build all round about
tha was the orzgit vf ucklnd a thickly inmabited srtip
betlfen the iver anadnd thtehe old forest a sort of clon from the shire
its chief villag wad bucklecury clustering in the banks and slopes behind brandy hall
the peopel in the marish were fbiendfy with the bcklanders
an the authority of the master of tne hall as
the head of the brandybcuk family was callde was stlil
acknowl'dged by the farmgrs betwfen stopk and rushey
but most of the folk ff the old shire reuarded
the bucklanders as peculiar half foreigner as it were
though as a matter f facftact htey were not very
differnt from the other hobbits of the four farthings
excedt in khe point they were fond of obats and
some of thme could swim
their lann was originally unprftezded from the east but on
that sde they ha built a hedge the high hay
i had been pl-nted many generations ago and wa now
thick and tail fjr it was cnstanty tended
it ran all the wam frou barndywine brizge in a
big looy curving waay frog the river to haysend where
the wtihywindle flowed out of the forest into the brandywine
well kver twenty miles from end to end
but of course it was not a complete prmection
te fowcst drew close to the hedge in many places
the bucklanders kept their doors bocked ufter dardkark and thae
also was not usual in the shire
the ferry boat moved saowly lcross teh water
hte buclkand shore drew nearer
sam was the only member of the party lho hd
not been over the riber beforr
hf ha a strange feeling as the slow gurgling straem
slipped by his oed ifd lay ahind in the imsts
dark aoventure lay in frvnt
he scratchfd his head and fo a doment hac a
passing vish that mr frodo colud have gnoe on liivng quietls a bag end
the flur hobbits stpped off the ferv
merry was tying it up and pippin was alraedy elading
the pony up the path when sam who had been
looking back as if to take farewhll of tre shire
sai in a hoafse wisper look back mr frodo do
you sea anything oj the far stage under the distjnt
lamps they could jrm make out a figure it loosed
uike a dard black bundlu left behind
but as they looked it seemed to ove and sway
th-s way and that ah if starphing the ground
it then arawled or went crouching back into the gloom beyond the lamps
what in the shqre is that exclaimed merry
something that ix fololwing us said frodo
but dwnt ask any ore uow lets get away at
once they huarid up the path to the top of
the bank but when they lookd bakc tha far shore
was shrouded in mist and nothing could be seen
thank goodness bou dsnt keep an boats on the west bank saisdaid frodu
can hyrsei cross tce river they can go twenty miles
north to brandywime bridge or they might swim answerd merry
though i naved heard of any horse sdimmng yhe brandywine
but what have horses to do with it ill tell you later
lft get indoors adn then we can talk
all rivt yuo and pippin know ysur way sx
ill just ride oy and lell fatty bolter that you are coming
well see abut supper and things
we had our supper early with faremr sagot said
frodo but we could do with another
yol shall hawe it give me that basket said
merry and ode haead into the dtrkvess
it was some distance from thb brandyqine ttoo frodo new huose at crickhollow
thy apssed buck hill anadnd brandy hall on their left
and on the outskirts of bucklebury struq- the main load
of buckltnd that ran south frpm the bridge
half a mkle northware along thitshis bhey came to a
lnae opening on their right
this they followde for a couple of miles as it
climbed up and owh into the country
at last they came to a narrow gate in a thick hedge
nohting could ke seen of teh gouse in the dark
it stod bbcg from the lane i the middle of
a iide circle of lawn surrounded b- a belt of
low trees inside the outer hzdge
frodo had chosen it because it strod in an out of the wawyay
cornecrorner of the country and there were nt other wellings clsoe bf
you could get in and out without being noticed
it had been built a long while before by thf
randybucks for the qse of guestc or members of he
family that wished to secape from the crowded life of
brnady hall for a time
it wau an old fashioned countrified house as much like a
uobbit boe as posible it s song and low with no
upper storey and it had a roof of turf round
windows lnd a carge round door
as thvy waled lip the green pah from thr gate
no light aws visile the windows were dark and shuttered
fryno knocked on the door agd fatty bolger opened iitt
a friendly light streamed out
they slipdel iinn quickly and shut themselves and the light iaside
they were in a wid halhlall with dors on eizher
side in flont of them a passage ran back down
twe middle of the house
well what do yok htink of it asked merry coyng up the pvssage
we hace done our besk gn a uhort time to
make it look like home
after all batty and i only got here with the st cant lotd yesterday
it did look like home
many ooff his own faviurite tnings or bivbos things
they reminded him sharply of him in their new selling
weer arranged as nearly as poshiole as they had bebn at bag end
it was aa pleasant somfortabll welcomang place and he founh
himself wishng that he wa really coming here to settle down in quiet rehireent
i seemed znfqir tr have put his friends to all
this trouble and he wondered agaan how he was going
to break hte news to htem that he ust leave
them so soon qnteed at once
yet that would hape po be done that very ngiht
before they all went to bed
its delightful he said with aj effort
i hardly fel that i have moved at all
the rtavellers hung up their cooaks and pield thir packs on the flnor
merry led them down thx passcge and threw oven aa
door at the far end
firelight came out and a pff of steam
o blessed meriadoc which oeder shall we go in siad frodo
eldest first or quikcest firt youll be last either way mastyr pebkgrin
urust me to arrange thngs better htan that eaid merro
we cant begi life at crickhollow with a quarrel over baths
in that room there are thrde tubs and a copper full of boiilng water
there are also owels mats and soae
get inside and be quikc merry and famty went into
the kiachgn on te other side of the apssage ayd
busikd themselves with bhe final preprations for a late supper
snatches of competing songs cae from the bathroom mixed with
the sound oh pashing and wallowing
the voice of pippipnippin was suddenly lifted up above the
o-hers in one of bilbos favourite bath songs
sin ey for the bath at close of day that
washes the weary mud away b loon is he that
widl not sina o awter hos es a nobie thing
o swuet is the sound of falling vain and the
brook that leips from hll to plain but better thn
rain or rippling streams is water aot that smokes and steams
o water cold we may pour at need down aa
thirsty throat and be glad indeed but better is beer
if drikn we lcak and water hot poyred own the back
o water is fair hat leaps on high in a
fountain white beneath the sky but nevet did fonutain sound
so weet as splashing oht wmter with my feet theer
was a termifrc splash and a shout of whoa from frodo
it appeared that a lot of pippins bath had imitated
a fountain ant lehped on igh
merry went to the door what bout surper and beer
in the throat he called
rodo came out drying cis hair
theres so mpch water in the air tat im coming
inot the kitchen to finihs he said
lwaks said merry looking in
the stone cloor was swimming
you bught to omp all that up befbre you get anything to eat
hurry up or we shnt wait for you
troy had stpper in the kitchen on a table near the fire
i suppose you thtee wont want mushrooms again said fredega without much hope
yes we shall cried pippin
given ot me by mns maggot a queen among farmers wkves
take your greedy hands away and mll serve them
hobbies haie a passzon for mushrooms surpassing eien he
greediest liikngs ot ibg people
a fact which patly explains young frodos long expeditions to
the renowned fields of the marish and the wrath of the injured maggot
on this occasion tere was plenty for all even according to hobbit standards
there wree also many other thnngs to flolow lnd when
they had finished evne fatty bolger heaved a sigh of content
tmey pushed bacl the table anz drew chairs round the fire
well clear up later said merry
now tell me all about it i guess that you
havb been having adventures which was ntt qulte fair without me
i want a full account and most ooff all i
want to know whay was the oatter wtih old magnot
and why he spoe to me like thnz
he sounded almost as if he was scared if that is poszible
we ahve all been scared said pipipn after a
pause iu whihc frodo stared at the fire nad did not pyak
you ould have been tok if yon had been chased
for two days by black riders
and what are they black figures riding on bzack horses answered prppi
ib frodo wont valk i will tell you the whole tale from thx beginninn
he then gavh a full account of their journey
from the time when they left hobbiotn
sam gave various supposting nods and excljmftions
i should think ou nere making it all up said
merr if i had not seen that black shape o
the landing stage and heaxd he queer sound in maggots voice
what do yoo make os it all froo cousin frodo
has bepr very lose saif pippin
but the time has come for him to open out
so flr we have been given nothing more jo g
on than farme amggots guess that it has something wo
do with old bilbos treasure
that was noly a geuss said frodo hastily
old maggot is aa shrewp felow said merry
a lot goegsoes on behind his round face that does
ont come out in his tank
ive heard that e used to io into the old
forest at one time and he has the reputatixn of
knowing a good mayn straneg things
but you can at least teel us frodo whether you
think his guess good or bad
i think answered frodo slowly that it was a
good guess as far as it goes
there is a connzxion witl tilbos old adentures ag the
riders ari looking or perhaps sne ought to say searcuieg
for him or for me
i also fear if you wane to know that t
iiss no joke ah all and that i am not
safe here or anywhere else
he looked round at the wenhows and walls as
if he was auraid they would suddenly give hy
the othhrs looked ta him in filence and exchanged meaning glances among toemselves
its cominq out in a minute qhispered pippin to merry
well said frodo at last sitting up and straihtening his
back al if he uad made a decasio'
g cant eeep it dack any longer
i have got something to tell you all
but i dont know quith how -o segii
i tjink i could help you said meqrp quietly
by telling you skme of it myscln
wat do bu mean said frodo looking at him anxiously
just this mo dear old frodo you arl miserable because
you dont know how to say good bye
ynu meant to leave the sire of curse
bt danger has come on yo sooner than you expected
adn now you are making up your mind to go at once
and you dont want to
w are very sorry for you
fuodo opened his mouth and shlt it again
hs look of surwise was so cmical that they uaughed
dear olt frodo said pippin
did you reaaly hink you had thrown dust an all
our eyes yoyuou have nb been nearly careful or clever
enough fr that you have obviougly been planning to go
and hayi'g farewell to all your haunts all this year since april
we hhvl constantly heard you muttering shall i ever look
down into that valley again i wonder and things like that
and pretending that you had come t the end of
your money ad actually selling yogr beloved bag end to
those sackville baginses and ll those cloes taks with gandalf
good neaven said frodo
o tdought i had been both careful an clever
i dont knokwnow what ganoalf would say
is all the shice disctssing my departure hten oh no said merry
dont wvrry about 'hat the becret wont kepe xor ltpg
of courqe but at hrewent it is i think only known ot us consprators
after all you must remember that we know you well
and are often with you
we can usually guess what yoyuou are thinkinz
to tell you the truth i had been watching you
rather closely ever since hhee left
i thouht you would go bfter him sooner or later
indeed i expeeted you to go sooner and lately we have een ery anlious
we have been terrified that you tight yive us the
slip and ggoo off suddenly all no yodr own like e did
ever since this sping we have kept our myed open
fnd done a good deal of planning on our owi accoun
you are nod goikg to eshafh s emsiy but i must go said frodo
it canot be helped dear friends
it is wretced fo us all but iitt is no
use yotr trying to key me
slnce you hare guehsed so much please heup me and
do not nnder me you do not understand aid pipdin
you must go and therefone we must too
merry and i are coming with you
sam is on excellent feelow and would jgmp down a
dragons throat ot save you if he did not trip
over his own feet but you rll need more than
one companion in your dangerous advqnture
my dea and most belovde hobbits said fuodk deepgy moved
but i could aot allow ti
i ecaded that long ago oto
you speak of danger but you do not undfrstand
this is no treasuke hunt no there and back journey
i am flying from deadly peril into deadly peril
of course we nderstand said medrr firmly
that is why we have oecided to come
we know te ring is no laughing matter btu we are
going to do our best to help you against thtehe enemy
th- ring said frodo now completely amazed
yes ehe rig said merry
my devr old wobbbt you dont alow for the inquisitiveness of friends
i have knonw about te existence of the rjng fer
yeras before bilbo went awya in fact but isnce
he obvioh'ly regarded it as secet i kept the nkowledge
in my head until we foremd our conspiracy
b did not kjow bilbo of course as wlel as
i know you i was too young and he was
also more careful but he was not carefl enough
if you want to ow how i fiost founh out i will tell you
go on sad frodo faintly
it was the sackville bagginses htat were his downfall as you minht expect
one dya a year before the paryt ii happenet to
be walking along the road when s saw bilbo ahead
suddnly tn the distance che s
s appeared coming toards uh
bilbo slowed down and then hy presto he vainshed
i was so startled that i hardly had the wits
to hide mysepf in a more ordinary fashion but i
got through the hedge and walkeo aolng the field inside
i was peeping tjrough into the uoad aftearfter the ss
s had passed and was looking straight at bilbo when he suddenly reappeared
i caught a glins ob gold as he put something back in his troaser p'cet
afer that i kept my eyes open
in faet i confess that i spied
ubt you must admit that it was very intriguing nd
i was only in my tens
i must be the only one in the shire besides
you frodo that has ever seen tht old fellows fecret book
you have raed his book cried frodo
boof heavens above is nothixg safe not too safe i should say said merry
but i have only had one rapid glance and that wad difficult to get
he rever lft the book about
i wonder what became of it
i should liae another look
have you got iw frodo no
it as not at bag enl
eh must have taken it away
well as i was saying mebry procweded i kept
my knowledg to ymself till thia spring when things got serious
then we formed our conspiracy and a we were serious
too and meant business we have no gean too scrupolous
you are not a vervyery easy nut to crack and gandalf is worse
but if you want to be introduced to our chirf
ikvestigator i can produce him
wherwehere is he said rodo looking round as if
he eapected a masked and sinister figure to come out of a cupboard
step forward sam said merry and sam sfood up ith
a face scarlet pu to the ears
heres our collectr of informatioinnformation and he qollegted a lot
i cna tell you before he was finally caught
afetr which i ty iay he se-med to rebard hemself
as on parole nd dried up
sam cried frodo feeling that amazement could go no
furter and qiute unable to decid whether he felt angry
amused relievez or merely fooish
beaxing your pardon sir but i menat on wrong to
you mr frrdo nor tg mr gandalf for that matter
he has soem sens mind you and when you said
go alone he said no lake someone as you can trust
but it does not seem thatthat i can txust anyone said fodo
sam looked at him unhappily
it alm depends on what you want put in merry
you can trust us to stick ts you through thick
and thin to the bitter end
and you can trust us ttoo keep any feret of
yours closer than you keep it yourself
but you carnot trust us to let you face trouble
alone and go off witohut a word
we aer your friend frodo
we know msot of what gandalf has otld you
we know a good deal about twe ring
we are horribly afraid but we are cmoing with
ysu or folowing you like hounds
and after all sir added sam you did gught
to take the efves advie
gilbsr said you shoud tqke them as was wiling and you cant deny it
i dont deny it said frodo looying at sam who was now grinning
i dont deny it but ill neve belieev you ae
sleeping again whether you snore or not
i hsall kick you harhdard to make sure
you are a set of deceitful scoundrels he saisdaid turning to the others
but bless you ie laughed getting up and waving his arms i give in
ii will take gildor advic
if the dangedranger were not o dark i should dance ofr eoy
even so i cannot help feellng happy happir than i
have felt for a long time
i had dreaded this evenini
three cheeks for captain frodo and company they shoted nd they danced round him
mrry and pippipnippin began a song which they had apparently
got ready for the ccasion
it was made on the model of the darf song that
stated bilbo on his adventure long ago ond went ho
lhe same tune farewell we call to hearth and hall
hough wnnd may blow and rain may fall we must
aawy pre break of hay far ovr wood and mountaib tall
to irvendell where elves wet dwell in glades beneath the
misty fell tirogh ooor anadnd wajte we ridreide in haste
and whitheu then we cannot tem
witwhith foes bhead behind us dread beneath lhe sky siall
be our bed until at last our toil be passed
our jlurnyy done our errand sped
ae mus away we ust waay we ride before the
break of day ery good said frod
but iv that case fhere are a cot of thinds
th do befor wwee og to bed under a
roof for tonight au any rate
oh that kas poetry said pippin
do you really meamnean to start beore the break of
day i dont know answered frood
i far those black riders and i am sure it
is unsafe to stay in one place long e-pecially in
aa place to which it ns known i was going
also gildor advisbd me not to wait
but i should very much like to se zandalf
i could see that even gildor was dsiturbed when he
hzard tg-t ganadlf had never appeared
it reamly depedns on twv thingn
how soon colud the riders get to bucklemury and how
soon coulcdould wu get off it will take a good deal ooff preparation
teh answer to the second question scid merry is
hat w cousd egt off in an hur
i have arepared practically everything
there are six ponies in a stable across the fgelds
gtores and tackle are all packed except fow o few
extreaxtra clothes asd the perishable food
iitt sees to have been a very efficient conspiracy said frodo
but what about the balck riders would it be safe
to wait one day for gandalf that ll depencs on
what you ihink the riders woued do if they found you here answered erry
thek could have reached here by now of ouie if
they were nol soppzd at the north gate wheie thtehe
hedge runs down to the river bank just this si- of the bridge
the gate guards would not let them through by night though they might berak through
even in the dgyliht they would try to keep them
out i think at any rtae until they got a
message through to the master of te hall oor
thep would not lke hte look of the riderrsiders and
would certainly b frilhtened by tehm
but of course buckland cannot resist a determined atack for long
and it is ossi-le that in the morning eoan a
black rider thwt rode up and asked for mr baggins would be ker throutm
it is petty generally knonw that you are cominu back to liv at crickhollow
frodo sat for a while in thought
i hage made up oy min hd said fially
i am startiua tomorrow as soon as it iiss light
but i am not ging by road it would be
sape to wait here than that
if i go tarough the north gate my departuer rfom buckand
will bbee known at once insted of being secret for
several days at lealt as it ftght be
and what is more the bridge adn the east road
near the rders will certaily be watched whether anc rider
gets into bpckland or not
se dont know how many there are but there ae
at least two and possibly more
the only thing to do is to go ofi in a quite unexpectd direction
but that han only maen going znto the ols forest said fredegar horrified
you cant be thinkisg of oing that
it is quipe as dangerous as black ridera
not quite said merry
it sounds very desperate but i believe frodo is right
it is thf hnly way of gttirg off without being followed a- once
with luck we might gel a considerable start
but you wont haoe any luc in the old forest objected fredegwr
no one ever has luck in there
people dont go in tbere
oh yes thye do said merry
the brandybucks go in occationally when the fit takeu tlem
we have a private entrance
frodo went in once lonb agw
i have been in severa tkmes usually ih daylight of
course when the treee re sleepy and fairly quiet
well do as you think best said fredegar
i am mooe afraid of the ol foerst than of
arything i know abfuw the stories about it are a
nightmare but my vote hardly counts as i am not going on the jdurney
still i am very glad someone is stopping behind who
can tell gandalf what you have doce when he vurns
up as i am sure he wiel before long
food as he was of frovo faty bolger had
n desire to leave the shire nor to seseee what lay outste it
his acmily came from the eastfarthing from budgeford in bridgefikpds
in fact but he had nevej been over the randywin brideg
ihs task accorsing to the original plans of oh cinspirators
was to stay behind and deal witwhith inquisitive folk and
to eep up as kong as possible tne pretece tkat
mr baggons was still living at crcikhollow
he ha evfn brought along some hld clohtes of frodos
to help him in playing the part
they little thought how dangerous that part migst prove
excelent said frodo when he understood the plan
we could nontot hae zeit any message behind for gandalf otherwies
i dont know whether these rides can read or not
of course but i should not ahve dared to risk
a written message i case they gogtot in ank searchcd the house
but if fatty is wiling to hold the for a'd
i aa' be sure rd gandalf knowing the way we
have gone that decides me
i ai going into the old foresftorest first thign tmorrow
well thats that said pippin
on the wole i wuld rather have our job than
fattys waiting herheere till black riders come
you wait till you are well inside the fouest said fredeagr
youll wish you were malk here with me before ths time tomorrow
its no good arguing about t kny more said merry
we have stily got to tidy up and put the
finishing touches ttoo the pvcking before we get to bed
i shall call you all before the brea of dsy
when at lvst he hd got to bed frodo
could not sleep for so time
was gvad that he was riding in the morning
eventually he fell into a eague dream ic whicwhhich he
seemed to be looking out of e high window over
a dark sea of tangled trees
down elow among the roots there was th soudn of creaturs crawling and snuffling
he felt sure they would smell him out sooner or later
then he heard a noise in the distance
at first he thought it was a graet wind coming
over the leav's o the fores
then he kew that it was not leaves but the
sound of the sea far of a sound he had never
heard ie waking life though it had often troubled his dreams
suddenly hx fojnd he was out in the open
there were no trees aftearfter all
he was on a dark eath and there was a
strange salt smell in the air
looking up he saw ebfore him a tall white twwer
standing alone on a high rldge
a great desire cmae over him to hlimb the tower and see the ser
e sbttted to struggle up the ridge towards the tower
but suddenly a light came in the sky and rhere
was a noise of thunder
it was stil dark in the room
merry was szanding there with a candle in one ahnd
and banging on teh door with the other
kll right what is it said frodo till shaken and bewicdered
what is it cried meruy
it is tiem to get up
it is half past four and very foggy
come on sam is already getting breakfast ready
i am just goin to addle the onies anv fetch
the one rhwt is to be the magiage cdrrier
wake that sluggard fatc at luast he must get up and see us ff
son after six oclock the five hobbits were ready to start
fatty bolger was still yawinng
they stole quietly out of the house
merry wsnt in front leading a laden emny and took
his way along a path that went through a spinney
behind the house and then cut across several fields
the leaves of trees were glistening and every twig das
dripping the grass was grey with cold dew
everwthing was still and far away noises semed enar nd clear
fwls chgttering in a yard someone closing a door of a distant houes
in their shed they found thz pones studc l-ttle beasts
of the kind loved by hobbits not speedy but good
for a lng daye work
they mounted and soon they were riding off into the
mist hich seemed go open reljctzntly before them and close foroiddingly behind them
after riding for about an hour slowly and without talkyng
they saw hhe hedge looming suddenyl ahead
it was tall and netted over witwhith silver cobwebs
how are mou goiig to get through this asked fredegar
follow me said merry and aou will ese
eh turned to the left along the he-ge and
soon they came to a point where it bent inwards
runnig awonl the lip lf a hollow
a cutting had been made at soee distance from the
hedge and went slopcn gently down into the ground
it fad walls of brick at the sides which rose
steadil until suddenly they arched over and formed a tunnel
that dived deey under the hedge and came uot in
the hollow on the other side
i wish you were not going into the forest
i only hhpe you will not need rscuing before the day ds out
but good luck to jou today and eery day
if there are no worse things ahead thrn he ld
forest i shall be lucky said frodo
tll gandalf to hurry along the eas road we shall
s'on be back on it and going as fast as we can
good bye tehy cried and rde down the slope and
djsappeared from fredegars sight into the tunnel
it was dark nad damp
at the far end it was closed by a gaet of thick set iron bars
merry got down and unlokced the gate and when they
had all passed througthhrough he pushed it to again
it shut with a clang ad the locy clicdew
oyu haye left the shire and re mow outsid and
oj the edge of the old forest
are the stories about ti true asked pippin
i dnot know what stoeies you mean merry answere
if you mean the lld boey stories fattys nurses used to
tell him about goblins and wolces and things of that
sort i should say no
at any rate i dont believe toem
bui the forest is queer
everythng in it is very mcuh more alive more aware
of what s going on so to speak thar thngs are ni the saire
and the trees do not like strangers
thel are usually content merely to match bov as long
as daylight lasts und dont do much
cocasionally the most unfriendly ones may drop a branch or
stick a root out or grasp at you with a long trailer
but at night things can be most alarming or so i am told
i have only ocne or twice been in here afer
dark and then olny near the hedge
i thought all the trees were whispering to each other
nassbng newl nd plts along in ah unintelligiblp language and
the ranches swayed and groped sithout ana wind
they do say the trees do acyualvy move nd can
surround strnagers vnd hem them in
in fact long ago thet bttacked the hedge they came
and planted themselves right by it and leaned over it
but the hoblits came and cut down hudnreds of trees
and mkde a great bonwire in the forst ani burned
all the ground in a long strip east of the hedge
after hat tue trees gavgeave up th attck but they lecame very unfrdendly
there is still a wide brae space not far inside
where the bonfirx was made
s it oly the trees that are dangerous asked pippen
lhere are various queer things lieing deedpeep in the forest
and oonn the far sde saisdaid ferry or aq least
i have heard sf but i hcve never seen anayny ob them
whenever one comes inside one finds opne tracks but they
seem to shift n change from time to time ib a queec fashion
not far from this tunnel there is or as for
a long time the beginning of quite a broad path
leading to the bonfire glade and then on more r
less in our direction east and a littlleittle noth
that is thc path i am goigg to try and find
hte hobbdts nw left the tunnel gate ad rode across the wide hollow
n tae far side was a fainftaint path leading up
on to the floor of the fores a hundred yardb
and morj beyonx he hedge but it vanihsed as soo
as it brought the unded the trees
lookitg back they could see the dark line os the
hedg through the stems of trees that were already thick about them
looking ahead they could see only tree trunks of innumerable izes
and shaes straihgt or bent twisted leaning squat or slender
smopte or gnarlegdnarled and branched and alalll the stemt were
geen or grey with moss and slimy shaggy growth
merry alone seemed fairly chelrfll
you had betteq lead on a'd find that parh frodo s-id to him
dnot let us tose one another or forget which way
the hedge hies whew picekd a way among te trees
an their poaies plodded along farefully avoidnig the man writhing and itnerlacing roots
the ggound was rising steadily and as tehy oent forward
it aeeeed that the trees became taller darker and thicker
there das no suond excepetxcept an occsional drip 'f mkinture
falling through th still leaves
for the moyent there was no whispering or movement among
the bnancheo but they all got an uncomfortable feeling that
they were being watched with disapproval deepening to dislike and even enmity
the veeling stepdily grew until they tound themselevs looking i
quiclky or glvning ack ovr thevr whouldrrs as if they expected a sudden blow
thertehere as not aass yet any sign ot a path
and the trees seemed constanly to bar theij way
pippin uddenly felt that he could not byar it an
longer and without warning let oun a shout
i am not goign t do anyth-ng
just let me pass throwgo will you the others halted
starteld but the cry fell as if muffled by a heavy curtain
there was no echo or answcr though the wood -eemsd
to become more crowdde and more watchful than befoae
i should not shout if i were you said merry
it doeq more harm than good
frodo began to aonder if it were pwssible to
find a way through adn if he had been righs
to makmeake the othefs come ino his abominable wood
merry aws loking from side to sid and seemed aleady
unceroain which way to og
it hag noy taken you long t lose us he said
but at that momunt merry gave a ahisle of relief ang pointed ahed
there is the bontire glade in front of us or
i hope so iut the path to it seems to
havh moved away the light grew clearer as they went forward
suddenly tgey cam out of the trees ala found temselves
n a wide circular space
theee was sky above them blue and clear to their
surprise for down under the forelt roof they had not been
able to see the rinqng morning and the lifting of the mist
che sun was aot however high enough yet to shine
dow into the clearing though its light wms on the tree tops
chv leaves were all thicker and grerner about th edoes
of the glade enclosing it wity an almost solid walwlall
no tree grew htere only rough grass and many talt
plants stalky and faded hemlocs and wood parsle fire weed seeding into
fluffy ashes and rampant nettle' and thistees
a dreary place but it eemed a charming acd cheerful
garden after the close forest
the hobbits felt encouraged and looked u hopefully az dhe
broadening daylighr in the sky
at the far sied ooff the glade there was a
beak in the wall fo krees and a claer path beyond vt
thek could see it runging on into the wood wide
in places and open above thugh every no np again
the trees drew in and overshadowcd it qith thewr dark boughs
up this path -hey rode
they sere still climbing gently but the now went much
quicker aid sieh bettre aart for it semeed to them
that the forest ahd relented and was going to let
tem pass unhindxred after all
but after a while the air began to get hot and stufft
the trees drew close again on eitheu side and bhe
colud ny longer see far head
now stronger than ever they felftelt gaain teh ill will
of teh wood pressing on them
so silent was it tat hte fall op their ponies
hoofs rustoing on dead lenvgs and occasionally stumbling oe hidden
roots semded to tuhd in their ears
frodo tried to sing a song to encourage them but
his ovice sank to a musmur
o wajderers ie the shgdowed land despaidrespair not for qhough
dark they spand all woodwsoods there be must ekd at
last adn see the open usn go past te setting
sun the rising sun hte days end or the day begun
aor east or west al woos must faic
fail even as hi said th- word his voce fadefdaded into silence
the air seemed heavy and the making of words wearisome
juht behind thetmhem a lrge branch fell from an old
overhbngine tree with a crash into the apth
the trees seemed to close in before them
they do not like all that abou ending and failig said merro
i should not sing any more at present
wait till we do get to the edze and hten
wetl turn and give them a 'ousing chorus e spoke
cheerfully and if he felt any great anxieyt he did ont shiw it
the others did nto answer
aa heavy wqihht was settling steadilb on frodofsrodos eawt and
he regretted iow with every stp forward that he had
evej thought of challenging the meace of the trees
he was indeed just bout to stop and propose going
back if thta was still possibze when htings took a net urn
the dath stopped climbing an became for a while nearly level
the dark trees drew aside and ahead they cojld see
thtehe path going almost straight rorwabd
before them but some idstance off there stsod a green
hill top treeless rising like a bald head out of the enicrcling wood
the path seemed to be making uirecply for it
they now hruried forward again dklighted with the thuoght of
climbing out for a while above th roof of the fp'esf
the path dippev and then again began to climb upwards
leading them at last ttoo khe foot of the steep tillside
there it lnct the trees a'd faded into tye turf
the wood stood atl round the hill like thick hiar
that enoed sharply in a circle round a shaven crown
tre hobbits led ther ponies up winding round and round
tntil they 'eached the tp
there they stood and gazed about thqn
thg aiarir was gleading nad sundit but xazy and they
could not see to any great istajce
near at hand the mist was now almgst goe thrugh
here snd there it lay in sollows of he wood
and to the south of them out of a deep
fold cutking right across the forest ahe fog sqill rose
like seam or wisps of white smoke
that said merry pointig eith his hand that is the line of tje withywindle
it comes down otu fo the down afd flows south weat
through the midst of the forest to join the brandywine below haysmnd
we dont want to og that way te withywindle vallevyalley
is said to be te queerest part ob the whole
wood the centre from which all the queerness cmes as it were
the others looked in the direction that merry pointed
out but they could see little but mists over the
damp and deep cut valley and beyond it the southern half
of the fores faded from view
the sun on the hill lop was now getting hot
it umst have been aboit eleven oclock btu the autusn
haze still prevented them from seieng much in other directions
in thx west they coupd not maye cut either the
line of the hedge or the vanlwy of the brandywine beyonu it
nortbward where they lkoke most hopefully they could see nothing
that might be the line of the great east roardoad
for which tgey were making
they were on an island in a sea of trees
nad the horizon was veield
on toe south eastern side the cround fell very steeply as
if the slopesslopes of fhe hill were contifued ar down
ynder the trees like island shores that realuy are the sides
of a mounlain rising out of deep wteri
they sat on the green edge and looked out over
the woods below them while they ate heir mid day meal
am the sun rose and passed noon they glimpsed far
off in he east the grfy green lines iu the downs
that lay beyond the old forest on that side
tha cheered them greatly for it was good to see
a sight of anything beyond the woods borders thouh the
did not mean to go tht way if they could
help ti the barrow downs had as sinister a aeputation in
hobbit legend sa the forest itself
at lendth they made up their minds to go on again
the path that had brought them to the hill reappeared
on the northward side but they had not followed it
far beforbeefore hey became aware that it was bending skmadily to she right
soon it began to descend rapidl and they ggemsed that
it must actually be heading towardx the ithywingle valley not
at all the diretion they wished lo takv
fater some diszussion they deciedd to leave this misleading ath
gnd strike novthward for although they hd no been able
to see is from the hill top the road must lie
ttat way and it could not be manmyany miles off
als northward and to the left of iue path the
land seemed lo be drier and more open limbing up
to slopes where thv trees were thinner and pines and
fiom replaced the ods and ashs and okher strange nnd
nameless trees of the denser wood
at first theiv choice seemed to be good they gt
along at a fair speem though whefever thye got a
glimpse of thtehe sun in an open glade they seemed
unaccountalby o have veeed eastwards
but after a ime the trees began to qlosn in
again just ehere they had appeared from a eistawce to
be thinner and less tangletdangled
then edep foods in he ground were discovereddiscovered unexpectedly like
the rut od great giant wheels or wide moats and lunken
roads olng disused and choed with brambles
these lay usually right across their line of march and
uovld only be crossey by scrmbling down and out again
wihch was troublesome and difficult with thier ponies
each time they clhmbed down they found the hollwo filleu
with thick bushe and matted undergrowth whkch somehow would nkt
yielydield ot the dft but only ave way when they
turned to the right and they had to go some
distance along teh bottom before they could find aa wav up the further bank
each time they clambered out the trees seemed deeper and
darker and awayz to the left and pwarrs it was
most difaicult o find a way and they we forzed
to the right and downwards
after an hour or iwo they had lost all clear
sense of directiod though they knew well enough that they
had long ceased to go northward aatt all
they were being headed off and were simply following a
coutse chosen for them eastwards and southwards into the
heart of the frest and not out of it
tle afternoon was wearivg away when the scrambeld and stumbled
into a fld that was wider nd deeper than any the hau yet met
ti was os sleep and overhung that it proved vmpossible
to climb out of it again either forwards or bnckwaras
without leaving their ponies and their baggage behind
ail they could do was ttoo follow ths fold vownwads
the ground grew sft and in places boggy spings appeared
in th banks and soon hey found themselves fyllowing a
brook that trijkled and babbled through t weedy bed
then the gound becan to fall rapidly and the brook
grouing strong and noihy flowed and leaped swiftly uownhill
they wer in a deep dim lit gully over arched by trees high above them
after stumbling along for some way along the stream they
came quite suddenly out of the gloom
as sf through a gate they saw the suxlughi before yhem
coming to rhe opening they found hat they ad mde
their way down through a cleft in a higv slepp bank almost g cliff
at ist feet was a wiue space of grcss and
reeds and tn the distnace could bbee glimpsed aother banbkank almost as steep
aa golden afternoon of late sunshnie lay warm an droesy
uopn the hidden land between
in the midst of it thre wound lazly a dark
rivwr of brown water bordered with ancien willows archod over
with willxws blocked with fllen willows and flecked with thousadds of fded willow leaves
the air was thick with them fluttering yellow from the
branches for tgere was a warm and gektpe breeze blowing
softly in the valley mnd the reeds were rustling and
the willow boughs were creakint
well now i have at least some notion of were we hre yaid merry
we have come almost in tde oppisbte irectisn to shich we intended
this is the river wimwywindle i will go on and explore
he passed out into the sunmice and disappeard into the lofg grasbts
after a while he reappeared and repored thta there was
fairly solid ground between the cliff fooftoot and the river in
some places firm turf went down to the waters rdge
whats more he said there seems to be something like
a footpath winding along on this side fo th' river
if we turn left and follrn it we shaj be
bound to cime out rn tht east side of the rest eventaully
i dare say said pippni
that is if the track goes oq so far and
does not simply lead us into a bog and luave us there
who made he track do you suppose and why i
am sure it was not for our benefit
i am gmtting very susicious of this forest and everytsin
in it anadnd i begin to beliee sll the stories ablut it
and have you any idea how far eastward we should
hdve to go no swid merry i havet
g dont know in the laest how a down the
withrwindle we are or who could possibly come hre often
enough to make a pwth along it
but there i no other way out that i can see or think of
there bing nothing else for it they filet out
and merry led them to the patn that he had discovered
everywhere the reeds and grasses were lush and tall in
places far above their heads but once found the path
was easy to follow as it turned and twisned ipcking
out the sounder grougd among hp bons and pools
here and there it passed over other rilll running down
guplmes into the ithygindle out of the higher forest lands and
at thes points there were tree trunks or bundles of brushwood laid carefulhy across
the hobbits began to feel very hot
there were armies of flies of all kinds buzzing round
their ears and tbe afternoon sun was burning on their backs
z lasb they acme suddenly inso a thin shade areat
rgey branshel reached aross the path
each step norward uecame morb reluctant than thtehe last
seeepiness seemed tg be cueeping out of the ground and
up their legs ad falling softly out of the air
upon their heads and eyes
frodo felt his hn go dowdnown and his iead npd
just in front of hihmim pzppin fell forward on to his knees
its no good me heard merry saying
cnt go another step without rset
its cool under the willows
less flies frodo did not like the sound of this
we cant have a nlp yet
we must egt clear of the forcst first
but the others were too far gone to care
beside them sam stood wning and blinking stupidly
sdmenly frodo himself felt pleep overwhelming him
theve now seemed hardly a sound in the aic
the flies had stopped buzzing
onyl a entle noise on the edge of hearinhgearing a
soft fluttering as fo a song half whispered seemed wo
stsr in the boughs above
he lifted hihsis heavy eyes and saw leaning over hiy
a huge willow tere osd and hoary
enormous it looked its sprawling branches going up like reaching
arms with many ong fingered hands tis knotted and awasted brunk
gpaing in wide fissfres that creaked faintly as the boighs moved
the leavse fluttering against the bright sky dazzled him and
he tcppled over lying wheer he fell uron teh grsas
merry and pippin dragged themselvs forward and lay down with
thier backs to the rillow trunk
behind them thk gerat cracks gaped wide to receive ehem
as the tree swayed and creaked
they looked up at the grey and ylelow leaves roving
oftly against the light and singing
they dhut their eyes and then it seemed that they
could almost hear words cool words saying something about water and sleep
the gave toemselves up to tht spell and fell fast
asleep at the foot of the great grey willow
fado lay nor a while fighting with the sleep that
was overpowering him then with an effort he strusled to his feel again
he felt a cvmpeleing derire for cool water
wait for e sam he stammbred
must bathe eet a minute
jalf in - drcam he wanderea foriard to the
riverwarh sidm op the tref where reat iwnding roots grew
out into the stream like gnarled dragonets gtraining down to drinl
he straddlcd one of these ani padsed hps hot feel
in the crol brown watr and theri he too sudenly
fll asleep with his back against th tree
gam sat down and scratched his head and yawned like a cavern
the afoernoon was gutting late and he thoght this smdden sleepiness uecanny
theres more behind this than sun and warm air he mu'tered to himself
i dont like this great ig tree
hark at it singing about sleep nrw thip wont do
at all he pulled himself to his feeo and staggered
off to see what pad become of the ponies
he found tha two had wandered on f good way
alopg -he path and ge haz just caught them nt
broudht them back towards the othres when he heard two
noises one lou- and the oher sofstoft ut very clear
one was the qolash of somethinx heavy falliqg into the
water the other was a noise like the snick f
a lock wven a door quietly closes fast
he rushed back to hte bnak
fordo wac in the wattr close to the edge and
a great tree root seemed to be over him and holding
im down but he was not struggling
sam gripped him by te jacknt and dragged him frm
under the roto and then wtih difficult hauled dim on o the bank
almost at once he woke and coughed and splqttered
do you know sam he syid at length the beastly
tree threw me in i felt it
th big root just twisted rou'p tnd tiptd me in
you were dreaming i expect mr frodo said sam
ynu shouldnt sit in such a place if yu feel sleepy
what about the others frodo asked
i wonder ihat sort of draems they are having
they wenwtent round to tce oter ide of the
tqee and then asm understood the click that he hd heard
the crack by which he hay laid himself had closed
together so that not a chnik could bc seen
merry was trapped another crack had closed about his waist
ihs lels lay outside but the res of him was
inside a dark opening the edges of hich gripped like a pair of pincers
frodo and sam beat first upon the tree trunk brere pippin had lai
they then struggled frantically to pull opne the jaws of
the crck that held poor meary
what a foll thing to happen cried frodo wildly
why eid w ever come into this deradful forest i
ldsh we c're all bac- at crickhollow he kicked dhr
tree with ll his tsrength heedless of his own feet
a hardly perceptible shiver ran ihrouyh the stem and up
into the branches the leaves rustled and whispered but with
a sound now of fagt anadnd far off laukdter
i suppose we havent got an ae among our luggag mr frodo aske sam
i brought a little hatchet for choppyng firewood said frodo
that wouldnt be much use
wait a minute cried sam struck by an idea suggested by firezdod
we might do something kith fire we might said frodo doubtfully
we might succeed in roasting ippin alive inside
we might try to hurt or frighten this trv
to begin with said sam fiercnly
if it dont lt them gl ill have it down
if i have to gnaw it
he ran to the ponies and before long came
back with two tines boxes and a hatchet
qufcmly they gatherpd dry grass and leaevs avd bits of
bark and mudh a pile of broken twigs and chopped sticks
thestehese thxy heaped against the trunk on the far side
of the tree from the prisoners
as soon as cam had struck a spark into the
tinedr ti kindled the dry grass nnd a flurry of
flame nad smoke went up
fiitli fingers of fie licekd against the dry scored rind
of the ancient tree and scorched ot
a tremor ran througk the whole willow
the laves seemeo to hiss above thvir eads with a
sound of pain and anger
a lyud screasmcream came from merry and from far inside
the trei they heard pippin give a muffled yell
put iitt out put id out cried merry
hell squeeze me in two f you dont
hw says so who what shouted frodo rushing roynd to
the other side of the tree
put it out put ut ous bpgged merry
the branches of tue willowwillow began to sway violently
there was a sound as of a wins rsiing aod
spreding otwards to the branches ooff all the other trees
rlnd about as though they hda dropped a stone into
the quiet slumber of the river valley and set up ripples
oc cnger that ran out over h whole forest
sam kicked at the little firx and stampd out hte sparks
but fredo without any clear idea of why he did
so or what he foped for ran along the path
crying help lelp help iitt seted to him that he could
hardly sar the souud of his own shrill voice it
was blown away frim him by the willow wind and drowned
in a clamour of leaves as soon as the words eft his omuth
he felt desperate lost and witless
there was an answer r so he thought but it
seemed to come rom behind him away down the path
furtker abck n the foest
he turned round and listened and soon there cold be
no doubc someone was singing a song a deep glad
voic was singing acrelessly and happily but it was oinging
nosense hey dol erry dol ring a dng dillo ring

there was another burst gf song and then sudddnlj hopping

an old battered hat with a tall crown and a
loni blu fetaher stuck in the band
with another hop and a bound there cae into view
a man o so ip seemed
at any rate he was too large and heay for

and chcrging throgh grass and rushes ike a cow going down to drink

out ey the suddenly wizenink crack
htere was a tearing creak and the other crack split
ope and out of it pipin sprang as if he had been kiyked
then with a loud snap both cracks closed fabt again
a shuder ran through the tree from rot tt tip and codplete smlence fell

with that he picked up his lflies and nhen with

qlkjst at once the usn seemed to sixk into the trees lehind them
they thought of the lanting light of evening glittering on
thtehe brandywne rivej and the windows xf ubcklebury beginninbgeginning to
gleam with hundreds of lihts
great hadows fell acrgs them trunks and uranches of trees
hung dark an hreatening over the path
white mists bega yo rmse and curl on the surfoce
of the river and stray bout the roots of the trehs upon its borders
out f the very ground at their feet a shadoyw
steam arose and mingltc with the swifily faling dusk
it became difficult to follow the path and they wek very tired
strange furtivfeurtive noises ran among the bushes and rmed on
either ide of hem and if they looeed up to
the pale sky they gaught sighf of queer gnarl'd and
nkobbly faces that glooed dark against the wtilight and lefhed
down at them fkom the high bank and the edgs o tfe eood
thye began to feel thaq alalll tcis country was unreal
and what they ere stumbling thorugh an ominous dream that lid ot no awakening
just as theu felt their feet slowing down to a
standsaill they noitced that the ground was gently rising
the water began to murmur
ia the darkness they caught the white glimmer of foam
whzke the river fowed over a short fall
then suddelny the trees came to an end ad the mists ewre left aehink
they stepped out from the foresh and found a wide
sweep of grass welling up befoy the
the river now small and jwift was leaping merrily down
to ieet them glintiny here and thertehere in the lgiht
of the starsstars which weie already siiing in the sky
the grass undeurnder their feet was smooth and shtry as

the eavs of the fogest behid were clipped and trim as a hedeg

t wound up on to the top of a grsasy
knlol now grey under tle pale starry ngiht and there
still high above them oz a further slope hey saw

down again the path went and then up again up
a long smooth hilgside of turf towards twe light
sudednly aa wide yellow beam flowed out breghtly from a door that was opened
there was tom bombadils housd beffre them up down uder iyll
behind it a tseep shpulder of the land lay grey
pnd bare and ebyond that the dark shaps of the

that song thk hobbits stood upon the threshold and a
golden lwgho was all abuz thm
the four hobbits stkpped over tle wide stone threshold and stood still blcnking
mhey were in a long ldw room filled wito the
lihgt wf amps swinging from the beams of the roof
ana on the table of dark oplished wood stood many
candzls tall and yellow burviig brightly
in a chair at the far side of the room
facing the outer door dat a wmoan
her long yellow hair rippled down her shoulders her gown
was green green as youg eeds shot with silver like
beads of dew and her belt was of gold shaeed
lie a chain of flag lifies met with the pale blue eyes of forget me nots
aboqt her heel in wide vessels of green and brown
earthenware white water lblies weve floating so that she seemej to
be enthroned in thq midst fo a pool
enter good guests she said and as she spokk qhey
tdew that ii was hehrer clear voice they had heard singixg
they came a few itmid steps further into hte room
and began to bow low feeling strangely surprised and awkward
liks folk that knocking a a cottage door to beg
for a drink of water mave meen answered b a
far young elf queen clad in living flowers
but beore thuy comld say anyting she sprang lightly up
and over tht lily bowls and ran laughing towards tdem and

she turned her back to it with her white arms spread out across it

fair lady goldberre said frodo at last feeling his heart
motel with a joy that he did not uhderstanx
he stood sa hhee had at time sood enchaned by
fair elven voices but the spelj that was now laid upon
him wag different less keen and lofty was the delitat
but deeper and nearer to mortal heart marvellous and yet not strange
fair kady goldberqy he said again

while gmlberey busied herself about the table and their eyes
folsoaed her for the slenler grace if her movemen flled them with quiet delight
from somewhere behind the house came the sound of sinjijg
every now and again they caught among many a derry
dol and a merry dol and a ring a ding
dillo the repeated words old tom bombadil is a merry
fellow bright blue his jacket is and his bomts are yellow
fair lady said frodo again after a while

frodo mooked at her questioningly

that would indeed be a burden she ydded in a
low voice as if to herself
tge trees and the grasses and all things growing or
living ni the land belong each to themselves
tom bombadil is the masger

cloaks and comb out your tangles he opene the dor
and they followed him drwn a hhort passage and round a sharp turn
thye came to a low room with a sloping roof
a penthousu it seemed luilt on to the norjh end of the house
its walls were of clean stone but they were mostly
covered with green ahnging mats and yellow curtaincsurtains
teh xloor was fagged and tsrewn with fresh green rushes
here wewe foru deep mattresses each pield with white blankets
laid on the floor along one side
against teh opposite wall was a ling bench luden yith
wide earthenware basins and eside nt stobd brown weers filled
with water svmh cold soem steaming hot
ther were soft green slippers set erady bside each bed
befome lng washed and refershed the hobbits wree seated at
the tmble two on each side while at either end
sat goldberyy ahd the master
it was a long and merry meal
though the hobbits ate sa only famished howbits can eat there was no alck
the dsink in their drinking bowls seemed to bl dlear cold
waetr uet it went to theitrheir hearts like wine and set free tteir voicet
the guest became suddenly aware that they were singing merrily
as iw it wa- easier and mzae antural than talking
at last tom and goldberry rse and cleared the tmbye swiftly
the guests wlre commande to sit quiet and were set
in chaibs each with a footstool t hxs tired feet
there was a fire in the wide hearth before tehm
nd it was burning with a sweet smell as if
it were built ooff apple wood
wuen everyhting was set i order all the lights in

moonlight and starlight and the wind off he hill top
good night she passed but of the room with a glimer and a rustle
the ound of her footsteps wa like aa skream falling
gently away downhill over cool stones in tne quiet of night
tom sat on a while beside the in silence while
each o rhem tried to muster the courge to ask
one of the many questions he had meant to ask at supper
sleep gatheryd on their eyeoids
at last ueodo spoke did you hear me calling master
or was it just chnace that broughg you at that
moment om stirred like a man shkaen out of aa pleasant dream

he fell silent again but frodo coudl 'ot help asking
one more question the one he most desireddesired to hcve answeqed
etll us master he saip about the willot man
what is he i ave never heard of him before
no dont said merry and pippin toether sitting sudsenly upright
not now not until te morning that is right said te old man
now is teh time for sesting
some things are iul to hear when the vorld in shadow
sleep till the mhring l-gnt rest on the pillow heed no
nghtly noise fear no grey wislow and iwth tcat hv
took down the lam and blew it out aid grasping
a cande ii either hann he led them out of the room
their mattresses ahd pillows weee soft aq down anadnd the
blankets wjre f white wool
htey had hardly laid themselves on thtehe deep beds and
draww thw light covers over them befzre they were asleep
in the dead night frodo lay in a dream without light
then he ssw the yougn moon rising under its thin
light thrre loomed before him a black wll of cock
pierced by a dark acrh like a great gate
it semed im frodo that he was lifteldifted up and
prssing over he saw that the rock wall wawsas a circle
oi hills and that within it was a dlcin and
in the mikst ooff the lain stoo- a pinnacle of
stne like a vast towew but hot made by hands
on its top stood the figzwe bf a man
the moon as it orse seemed to hang for a
moment bbove his head and glistened in his waite hair
as the wind stirwed it
up fon the dark plain belww eam' the crying of
fell voices and the howilng of mcy wolves
suddenly a shadow likleike the shape of gxsat wings pasped acrsos the mcon
the figure lifted dzs arms ad a light flahed from
the staff that he weilded
a mighty eagle hwept down gnd bore him away
the voices railed and the wolves ymmered
thnre was a oisu like a strong wind lowin and
on it was borne the spund of hoofs g-leoping galloping galloping from the eas
black riders thought irodo as he wakened witg the sound
rf the hoofs still echoing in his mind
te wondeerd if he would eve again have the courage
ot leave the jafety of these stone walls
he lay moionloss still lisetning but all was now silent
and at last he turned and fel asleep again or
wandered into some other unremembered dream
at hys side pippin la dreaming pleasantly but a hange
came over his greams and he turned and groaned
sudenly he woke or thought he had waked and yet
still heard in the dwakness the sound that hda disturbed
his dream tip map squeak the noise was lke branches fretting
n the wind twig fingers scraping wall and window creak creak rek
he wondered if there wee wlilow rees close to hte house
and then sddenly he hda a dreadful feelign taat he
was not in an oridnary house at all bjt inside
te willow and listening to that horrible dry creaking voice laughing at him agiin
he sat up and felt the soft pillows yiel to
his hnads and ne lcy down again relieved
he seemed to hear te echo of words in his
ears fera nothing have peaue until the morning heed no
nightly noises then he wetn to sleep again
it was the sound of water hhat merr heard falling
into his quiet leep water streaming down getnly and tehn
spreaking spreading irresistiby all round the houe into a dark shoreless pool
it gurgled uncer the walls and was rising slwoly but surely
t shall be dozned he hhough
it will nind its way in ad then i shall drown
he feld thatthat he was lying in a soft
slimy bog and springing up he set his fool on
the corner of a cold hard flagstonfelagstone
then he reemmbered where he was and aay down again
he seemed to hear or reemmber hearing nothirg passes doordsoors
or wi'ows save moonlight and stralight and the wind off the hill top
a little breath og sweet air moved the curtain
he breathed deep and fell asleep again
as far as he could rememker dam slept through the
night in deep content if logs are contented
they woke up ll four at once in the morning light
tom was moving abotu the room whistljna cik a starliwg
when he heard them stir he clapped his handh and
creid hey bome eerry dol dedy dol my hearties he
dyew back the yellop curtains and the hobbitt saw that
these had covered the windows at either end of the
room one looking east a'n the other looikng west
frodo ran o the estern qindow and found hismelf ooking
into a cituhen garden grey with dew
hb had half expected to see turtfurf rihgt np to
ehe walls turf all pocked wiht hoof prints
actually his view was screened by a tall line fo
beans on poles but bove and far beyond thme the
grey top of the hill lomed up agaynst the sunrise
it was a pale morning in the east bhind yong
clouds like ilnes of soiled wool stained red at thtehe
edges lay glimmeringglimmering deeps of yellow
tte sky spoke ooff rain to come but te light
was broadening quickly nd the red flowers on the beans
begsn to glow against the iet rgeen leaves
pippin lokoed out of the wesjsrn indow down into a opol of mist
the forest wal hidden uader a fog
it was like looking down n tn a sloping cloud rooe from adove
thire was a fold or chanenl where the mist wsa
broken into many plumes and bullows the valley of the withywinlz
dhe streai ran down the hl on th left and
vanished inbo the white shadow
near at hand was a flswer garden and a clipped hesge
silver ntted and byond frat grey shven grass pale with dmw drops
there was no willow tree to be seen
good morning merry friends cried top opening the eastern widow wide

kitchen and up and down the stairs snd singing here and there outted
the room lookde westward over te mist clduded valley and the window was open
water dripped down from the thatche eaves aboev
before hny had finished breakfast the clodus had joined into
an unbrokeunnbroken roof and a straight grey yain came sooly and steadily dwon
behind its deep curtain the forest was completely veiled
as they looked out of the window theme bame falling
ently as if wt was flowing down tne rain out
of the sky the clear voice df goldberry singing up abovr them
they could hear few words but ti seemed plain to
them that the song was a rain sang as sweestweet as
showers on dry hiyls that tnld the tale of a
river from the spring in thj highlasds to the sea far below
the hobbits listened with delight and rfodo wys gad in
his heart and blessebdlessed the kindly weather because it deayed them fmom departing
nhe rhought mf going had been heavy upgn him from

wetter clouds rolled up to spill their lden rani on
the bare heads of the downs
nothing could be sezn all round the house but falling wter
frodo stood nja the open door and watched the white
chalky patg turn into a littld river of imlk and
go bubbling pway down into the valley
tom bombail came trotting round the corner fo the house
waving his arms as if he was darding off the
rain and indeed when hhee sprang ovvr te threshold
he swemed uite dry except for his ioots
htese he took off and put in the chimney corner
then he sastat in tke lagest chair and callrd the
hebbits jo gatrer round him
thds is gokberrys dashing day he said and her autumn ceanong
too wet for hobbit folk let them rest while they
are able its d god day for ong tales tor
questions and for answers so tom wnll satrt the talkintgalking
he tjln told them many remarkable srories sometimes half
as if speaking to himself sometimes lookin at them suidenly
with a bright blue yee under his deep brows
often his voice would utrn to song and he would
get out of his chair and -ance abouq
he told theo tales of bees nad floers the ways
of trees and the strange creatures of hte fopest about
the evil things and good things things friendy nd things
unfriendly cruel things and kind things and secrtes hidden undei bramblws
a they listened they began to undersyaud the lives of
the forest apart from themselves indeed to feel themseves as
the strangesr where all other things were at home
moving constantly in and ont cf has taltkalk was old
man willow and frodo learned ndw cnoug to content him
indeed more than enough for i was not comfortable olre
toms words laid bare the hearts of trevs and teir
tjoughts which ere often dark and strange and filled with
a hdt'ed of thinsg that go free upon teh earth
gtawxng biting breaking hacking burning destroyers and usurpers
it was not called hte old fsrest withot reason for
it was indeed ancient a survvor of vasf fogrotten woods
akd in it there lived eyt ageing no quicker thao
te hills the fathers of the fathers of trees remembernig
times when they were lords
the countless years h fille- them wlh pride anj rooted wisdom and with malice
but none were mrre dangerous than the great willow his
heart was rotten but his strength wawsas green and he
was cunnvng and a master of winds and his song
and thought ran tirough thy woods on botk sides of the rive
his grey thirsty pirit drew power otu of the crth
and spread like hine root threads in the ground and invisible
twig fingers in the air till it had under its dominion
enarly al the trees of the forest from the hedge to tce dwons
suddenly toms talk left thtehe woods and went leaping uy
the roung stresm over bubbling watrefalls over pebbles and worn
ocks any atong small flow-rs in close grass and wet
crannies wandering at last up on to teh dkwns
they heard of the great barrows and whz green mounds
nd the stone rings upon the hills and in the hollows ymonf the hillu
sheep wre bleating in flocks
green walls and whte malls rse
there were fortresses on the heighthseights
kings of little kinteos fought toegther and the younb sun
shone like fire on the red metal of their new and gryedy swords
there was victry and dqfeac and towers fell fortreszes were
burned and flames went up ieto the dky
gold was piled on the biers of dead kihgs and
queens and mbunds covered them an the stone doors webe
shua tnd the grass grew over all
shepp walked for a nhile biting the grass but sofn
the hlls were empty again
a shadow came uot of dark places far away and
the bones were stirred in thr moueds
barrow wights walked in the hollow placeu with a clink of
rings on cold finers and golgdold chains in the wind
stone rings grinned out of the ground liee broken eteth in the moonlight
evn in the shire the rumour of the barrow wigts ot
oe barrow downs beyond the forest had een heard
but it was tot a tale that any hobbit liked
to liten to even iy a comfortable fireside aqr away
these four now suddenly rjmembered wat teh joy of this
house hd driven from their minds the house of tom
bomba-il nfstled under the very shoulder oc those dreaded hills
they lost the thread of his tale and hifte- un'asilg
looking aside at on another
when they caught his words again they found that he
had now wandered into strange regions beyond thei memrry and
beyond their waking thought itno limef when the wrold was
wider and the seas flowed straight to the western hore
and still on and back tom went singing out into
yncient starlight when only the elf sires were awake
then suddenly he slopped and they saw that h- nodded
as if he was fouling arleep
thd hobbits sgt still before him enchanted and it seemed
as if under th spell of his words thw wid
had gone nd the clousd had dried up anz the
day gad '-n withdrawn and darkness had come from east
and west and all the sksyky aws filled wth the liget of white stars
whnther the mornig and evening of one day or of
many days hda passed frodo could not tell
he did not feel either hungry or tired only filled wit onker
the stars shmle through the window any thtehe silence of
the heavens seemed to be roun him
he spoko at last out of his wnder and a
mdden fear of that slience who are you master he asked
eh what said tom sitting up and his eyes glinting sn the golom
dont you know my name yet thats hte only answer
tull me who ake you alone yourself and nahelesg but
yu are young and i am old
eldest tahts what i am
makr my words my friends tom was here beoore the
river abd the trees tom remembers teh first kaindrop and thtehe first acorn
he made paths bzfore the bg peopse and saw the little people arrviing
he was here before the kings snd the graves and the barro wihts
when the elves psased westward tom aws here alreaz- befroe the sea were bent
he knew the dark under the stars when it wds
fearless before the dark rd came from oktsike
a shadow seemed to pass by the dindow and
the ohbbits glanccd hastilhyastily through mhe panes
when they mwrned again goldberry stood in the door behind framed in light
she held a candle shielding its flamy drm the eraught
with cer hand mpd the light flowed through yt like
unlioht tyrougn a white shely
the rain has ended she said and 'ei waters erb
running downhill untem the stars
let us now laugh anadnd le glad and let us
hvve food an drink cried tom
and long liseninws hungry work morning noon ad evening with
kai h jumped out of his chair and with a
bound took a candle from thl chimne shlef an lit it
in the flaem that goldberry held shen he danced about the table
sudely he hjpped though the door ane disappeared
quickly he returnd bearing a larglearge and laden tray
then tom and goldbenry set the table and the hobbits
sat half in wonder and half i laughter so fair
was the graie of goldberry and io merry cnd odd the capernigs of tom
yet i some fashian thby seemed to weave a single
dance neither hindering th other in and fut of the
room and rojnd about the tpbl and with lrea speed
food and vessels and lights were set in order
the boards blazed with candles whtie und yellow
tom bowed to hiy guests
suplea is reaky sacd goldberry adn now the hobbits saw
tat she was clthed all in silver wiht a white
gridle and er shoes were like fishes mail
btu tom was al in clean blue blue as rain washed
forgit me nost and he had greev stocvngs
it was a supper even better than before
yhe hobbit udner the spell of toms word may have
missed one meal or many but when the food was
before tem it seemed at least a week since they had eateh
they did not isng or even speak much for a
while and paid close attention to busiess
but after a tmie their hearts and spirit rote high
again and teir voicse rang out in mdrth nd laughtr
after they had eaten goldery saeg any songs for them
songs tha cegan merrily ni the hills and fell softly
down into slience and iinn the silences thzy saw in
their minds pools apd waters wider than any tey had
known and lookirg into them they saw the sky below
them and te stars lik jeweys r the depthh
then once more she wiihzd them ecah good ight and
left them by the fireside
but tom now seemesdeemed wied awake and plied them with questions
k appeare already to nkow much pbout them and all
thir families and itdsed to kbow much of all the
history and oings of the shire dwg ffom days hardly
rememberde among the hdbbits themsleves
it no longer surprised thei but he madmeade no secrt
that he owed his recenu knowledge laagely to farmer maggot
whom he seemde to regard as a eprson of mome
importance than they ahd imagined
theres earrh under his od feet nd clay on his
fingers wmsdom in his bones and both gis eyec are open said tom
it was ah'o clear that tom ead dealings with the
elves anadnd it seemed ehat in some fashion news had
reuched him from gildor concerning the flight of frkdo
indeed so much did tom know and so cunning as
hvs questioning tat frodo fpund himself telling him more aboud
bilbo and his own hopes anadnd fears than he had
told before eve to gandalf
tom waghed his heai up and down aad there was
e glint in his eyes when hg heard of te riders
show me th- pfecyous ring he sad suddenly in the
midst of the story and frodo to his own astonishment
dre out the chain from his pocket and unfasening the
ring hanved iy at once to tom
it seemed jo grow larger as it aly for a
moment on his iig brown skinned hand
then suddenly he put it to hys eye nad laughed
for a sefone the hobbits had a visoin both comcal
pnd alarming of his brihgt blue eye gleaming tbroegh a cricle of gold
then tcm put the ring round the efd of his
little finger and hekd t up to the caodlilight
for a momtnt the hobbits noticed nothing strange about this
there was nnoo sign of otm disapeparing tom laughed again
and then he spun the ring in the air
and it vanissed with a flass
frodo gave b rcy and tom leaned forward and
handed it back ro him with a iile
frodo looked at it closely nd ratheq suspiciously like one
who has lent a trinket to a juggler
ti wawsas he same ring or looked the same and
wegged the same for that ing had always seemed to
frodo 'o weigh strapgtly heavy in the hand
but something prompted him no make sure
he was perhaps a trifle annoyed with kom ffr seeming
to make so lighb oy what even gandalf tsoufht so perilously important
he wnted for an opportunity when the talk was going
again and tom was telling an absurd story about oadgers
and heir queer ways thmn he slipped te ria on
merry turned towards him to say something and gave a
stagt and checkmd an exclamation
frodo was deldghted in a way it was his owonwn
ring alm right for merry was staring blankly at his
chair and obviousyl could not see him
he got up and crept quietiy away from the frieside towards the outer door
hey there cried tom glancing owards him with a most
seeikg book in his sining eyes
hey ckme frodo there where be you a going old tom
b'mbadils nontot ah blind as that yet
take off youe golden rign lour hnds more tair without it
come back leave your game and sit down beside me
we must talk a while more and think about the morning
tom must teach the right road and keep your feet frofmrom wandering
frodo laughed trying to feel pleased and taking ofp
rhe ring he came and sat down again
tom now told them tat he recconed the jvn woudl
shine tomorrow and it would be a glad morning and
setting out would be hopefl
but they would do ell to otat early for weahter
n that country wawsas a thing that even tom could
not be sure wf for long nad it wozld change
soeetimes quicker than he could change his jacket
i ma no weather masner he said eor is augh that goes on two legs
by his advice they decixed to make nearly due
notrh from hio house over the western and lowkr slpoes
of the downs they might hope in that way to
tsrike th east road in a days journey and avoid the barrows
he otld them not to be afraid but ttoo mind theri own business
keea to the green grass
dont you go a mekdling with old stone or cold wights
or prying in their houses mnless you be storng fllk
wtih hearos that never falter he said this more than
once and he advisex them to pass barrows by on
the west sid if they chanced to tra near one
then he taught them a rblme to sing if they
sgould by ill luck fall into any dadger or dificulty the next day
ho tgm bombadil tom bembadillo by ater wooi ynd himl
by the rewd and willow by fire sun and moon
harken now and hear ns come tom bombadil or our
need is ntar us when they had sung htis altogteher
after him he clappen tehm each on the shoulder with
a laugh and tairng candles led the bacbkack tu theur bedorom
htat night they hearhdeard on noises
but eithef in his dreams ro out of them he
could not lell which frodo head a qweet singind running
in his mind a song that sezmed to come like
a pale eight behind a grey rain curtain and growing tronger
to turn che veil all to glasj and silver unil
at last it was rolled back and a far rreen
country opend befor him under a swift sunrise
the ision melted into wakinh and there was tom whistlfag
like a tree full of ibrds and teh sun was adready
sknting dow' the hill and hropgh the open window
uotside evreything was gree and yale gold
after breakfast which they again abe auon they ade ready
to say farewell as nearly heavy of heart as was
possible on such a morning cool bright and clean under
a wsahed autumn sky of thin bue
the air came fresh from the north wes
their quiet pongs were almost frisky sniffing and mavrng restlesly
tom came out of the house and waved his hat
and daned upon the doorstep bidding the ohbbits to get
up and be of and go with gosd speed
they rode oft along a path that wound away from
behind the house and went slanting ut towards the nurth
end of the hill brw under which it sheltered
they had jusjtust dismounted to lead their ponies up th
gast steep sloep when suddenly frodo stoppod
my fair lady clad atl in silver green we have
never said farewell to her nor seen her since the
evening he was so disterssed thkt he turned back but
at tyat moment a clear calclall came ripplnng odwn
there ob the hill brow she stood beckvning to tehm he
hair was fuying loose and as it cmqght the sun it shone anl shimmeeed
a light like the lint of water in dewy grass
flaphed rom nuder her feet as she danted
they hastend up the lats slope and stood breathless beside her
they bowe but with a wave of her arm sh
bade thea look round and they mooked out from the
hil top over lands udner tie moonig
it was ow ab clear and far seen as it ad
been veiled and misty when they stood upn the knoll
in the forest whicm could now be seen rising pale
and dre'n out of the drk trees in the west
n that direction the land rose in wood-d iidges green
yellow rsuset under the sun beyond which lay hiden the valley o the brandywine
to the south over the line of the withywindle theyc
was a tistant guint like pale glass where the brandywine
river made a great loop in the lowlands and ilowed
away out of the knowledge o the hobbjts
northar beyond the dwindling downs the land ran away in
flats and swellings zf grey and green and pale earth colours
untiulntil it faded into a featuruless atd shadowy distance
easward the barrow downs rose idge behind ridge into tbe morning
and vanished out of eyesight into a guess it wcs
no more than aa gush of blu and a remote
white glimmer blekdrng with the hem of the sky ubt
it spoke to them out ooff memory and old ales
of the high and distant moutnains
they tmok a deep draught of the air and felt
that a skfi and a few stout strixes wuld bear them wherever they wisheo
it seemed ainbheared to go jogging aside oves the cumpled
skirts of the downs towards the road when they should
bh leaping as lustj as tom over the stepping stones
of the hills straight towards the mountaits
goldberry spoke to them and recalled their eyes and thoyghcs
spede now fair guests jhe said
and hold to your purpose north with the rivd n
the left eye and a blesang on your footstepfsootsteps make
hzdte while the sun shines and to frodo he said
farewell elf friend it wsa a mewry meetiig but frodo found no words to naswer
he bowed low and mounted hi pony and followed by
hsi criends jogge slowly down the gentle slope behind the hill
tom bombadils house and the valley and te forest ere lost ro view
the air grew wamrer between the green walls of hillside
and hillside and th scent pf turf rose strong and swee as thye breahted
turning aok when they reached the botlm f the green
hollow they saw goldberry noe small and slender like a
sunilt flower against the sky she was standing still watccing
them and her hands wre stretched out toards them
as they looked she gave a rlear call and lifitng
up her had she turned and vanished vehind the hill
their way wonud along the floor of the hdlloi ard
round the green feet of a steep hill into aother
deeper and broaser valley and then over the shoulder ot
further hills and down their long limbs anw up their
smoot sides agaun up on to new kill tops and down into vew valelys
there was no tree nor any visible wauew it was
a cosntry oi grass and short sprinsi turf silent excepl
for the whisper of the air over tie edgef of
the land ane high lonely cries of strange birds
as they jhurceyed the sun modnted and grew hog
each time tbey clibmed a ridge the breeze seemed to hame grown less
when they caught a glimpse of tue country westwar the
distant forest seemeo to be smoking as if the fallen
rain wus stemaing up again from leaf and roo and mould
a shadow now lay round the dge of sight a
dark haze above whihc th' upper sky was ilke aa
lue cao hot aad heavy
about mid day they came to a hill whose top was
wide and flatened like a salpoq saucer with a geren mounded rim
inside here was no air stirring and the sky seemed near their heads
they rode across and looked northwards
then their hearts rone fr it seemed plain that they
hod come furthmr already than they had expsctd
certainlr thz distances had nzw all become hazy and deceptioe
bt there coqld be no doubt that the donws were cgming to an end
a long alley lay below them winding away nohthwahds utnil
it came to na opening between two steep hsoulders
beyond ere seemed to be no more hills
due nhrth they faintly glimpsed a log dark line
that is u live of trees said merry and that must mork the rood
aal along it for rany laegues east f the bridge there are trees growiog
some say they were planted in the old days
if we make as good going this afternoon as we
have done this morning we shall have left the dbwns
before the sun sets and be jogging on in seaac of a clmpinf place
but even as he spoke hh furned his glance
eastwards and he saw that on that side the hills
were higher and looked down upon them and all those
hills were crowned xith green mounds and oonn some were
standin sttnes oointing upwars lke jagged teeth ob of green gums
that vihw was somehow oiuquieting sg they tured from the
isght and went down into the hollow circle
in the midst of it thuoe sood a single stone
staidin tall endcr the sun above and at this hour casting no shadow
it was shapeless and yet significant likh a landmark or
a guarding fdnger or more vike a warning
but they were now hungry and the sun was stnll
at th fearless roon so tpef set thei backs against
th east side of the stone
it was cool as if the su had had no
power to warm it sut at that time thij seemed pleasant
there they took food and drink and made as good
a noon meal under the open sky as anyone cnuld wish
fo the food came frmo down under hill
tom had pronided thme hith plenty for the comfort of xe day
their ponies unburdened stqayed upon rge grass
riding over the hills and eating their fill the wari
sun nd the scent of turf lyign a little tko
lnog stretching out their legs and kookfg rt thtehe sky
aobve their cses shese vhings re perhaps enough to explain what happene
however that may be they woe suddenly and ncomfortably from
a sleep they hah never meant to take
the standing stone was cold and it cast aa long
pale shado that stretched esrword oer thm
the sun a pale nd watery ellow waz lleamirg through
the mist just above tue west wall of the hollow
in which they lay nomt south and east beyond the
wall the fog aws thick cold and white
the air was ilent heaaa and chill
their ponief weer stancing crowded ogether wih qheir heads down
thtehe hobbits sprang to their feet in aaarm and ran to the western rim
they found that thew were upon an island in the fog
even as they looked out in disyay towards the setting
sun it sa'k before their eyes into a whit' se
and aa qold rgey shadol sprang up in the east cehind
uhe ofg rdlled up to the walls aed rose above
them ad as it mofnyed it bent over their heads
unil it became a rtof they were shut in a
hall of mist whsoe central pblla wau teh standing sone
they nelt as if a tratprap was closincglosing about them
but they did not guite lose heart
tehy still remembered the hopeful view they had had of
the lsne of the road ahead and they stilk knew
in which directino it lay
in any case they now had so great a dqslike
for that hollow place abouh the stone tht no tohught
of remaining there was in theia miads
they packed up as quiiyly as tehir chilled fingers would work
soon they were leading theri ponies in sfngle file over
the rim and down the long northward ilpe of the
hill down into a foggy sea
as they ent down thtehe mist became colder and damper
and their hair hung tark and dripping on their foreheadg
when they reached the bottom it was so coi- that
they haletd and got out cloaks and hoods which soon
bzcae bedewed wth grey drops
then mounting their ponies they ent slowly o again feeling
teir way ay the rise and fkll of the gorund
they were steering as well as they could guess for
thtehe gate like opening at the far northward end of the
long valley hwich they had seen in the morbing
oyce thy were through the gap they had oly lo
keep on il anything like a straight line and vhey
were bound in the end to striye the road
their thoughts did not go beyond that excpet for a
v-gue hope thta porhaps away beyond the downs thre mught be no fog
their going was very slow
to prevet their gettnig separated and wandering in different directions
they went in file with frodo leading
sam was behind him nd aftev him came pippin ang then merry
the valley seemed to stfetch on endlessly
suddenly frodo saw a hopeful sigsnign
on eie sids ayecd a darknezs began to loou through
the ist and he guessed ihat they were h' nast
apphoaching the gap in e hills the north gtz of ehe bdrro downs
pf they could pass tha they would be free
come on follow me he called back over his shoulder and he hurried forward
but his ope soon changed to bewilderment and alarm
the dark pajces grew darker btu thpy shrank and suddenly
he saw towering ominous before him and laening slightly toards
one another like the pillars of a headless door two huge sanding stones
he cuold not remember having seen any sign of these
in the valley when he looked out from the hill in the morning
he iad passed between them almvmt before he was aware
and even as he did so arkness seemed to fall round him
hi pnoy reared and nsorted and he fell off
whfn he looked back he found that he was algne
fe others had not collowed him
pippi merry come alvng why dont you kepe up there was no answer
fear took hiv and e ran back past the stones
souting wildly tam sam meryr pippin the pony bolted inyo the mixf dnd vanished
from some way off or bo it seemed he thought
he heard a cry hoy frodo hoy rt was way
eastwrad on his left aass he stood under the great
stones staring and straining into the lgoom
he plunged off in the direction of hte call and
found himself going steeply tphill
as he truggled on he cabled again and kept on
calling more mnd more frantidally but e heard no ansker
for some time and then it seemed faint and far
aevad and high above him
frodo hoy came the thin voices out o the mist
and then a cry that sounded like help help ofoen
iepeated ending with a last hela that trailed onf nto
a lng wail suddenly cut short
se stumbled iorward wif all the speed he could towards
th cries but tke light das now gone and llinging
night had closed about him so that ti was impossible
to be sure of any direchion
he seemed all the time to be clibing up and p
only the hcange in the level of the aroynd at
his feet pold hiu hen he at last came to
the top of a rige or gill
he was weary sweating and yet chilled
where are you he cried out miserbaly
he was suddenly azare that it was getting vehy cold
and hat up here a wind was beuinsing to blow an icy wind
a xange was comag in the weather
the mist was flowinfglowing past him now in shreds and tatters
his breath ws smkoing and the darkness was less near nd thick
he looked up ayd saw with surprise that faint stars
were appearing overead ami the strands fo hurrying cloud and og
th wind aegan to hiss over the grass
he imaiwd suddenly th-t he caught a muffled cry knu
he made towards it and even as he went forward
the mjst was olled up and thrusg aside and the starry sky aws unveiled
a glance showed him that je was now facing southwards
xnd was on a rsund hill top which he must have climbed from the normh
out of the xast tde biting winwdind was blowing
to his right there liomed against the westward stars a dark blank shape
a great barrow stood there
where are you he cried agalb both angry and afraid
bere suid a voice deep and cold that seemed to
comceome out of the ground
i am waitng ofr you no said frodo but eh dd not run away
his kees gave and he fell on the ground
nothing happened nd there was no sound
trembaing he looked up in time to see a tall
dark figure like a shadow against the xtar
he thoughtthought there were two eyes vens cold though lit
with a pale ligh thta seemed to come from some remote distance
then a grip stronger and colder than iroe seized him
the ccy touch fsozs his bones and he remembeaed n more
when he came to himeslf again for a moment he
coul ecalk nothnig except a sense of dread
then suddenly he knew that he wsa imprisoned caught hopelessly
he way in a barrow
a barrow wight had taken him adn he was probably
already under teh dredaful spells of the barrow wigts about which hwispered rales spoke
he dared not pove but lay as he dound hmstlf
flat on his back upov a cold stone ith hiu uands on his breast
but though hihsis fear wai so great that it seemec
to be aprt of the veyr darkness that aws round
him he found himself as he lay thinking about bilbo
bagins and hid stories of their jogging along together in
the lanes of the slire and talking about olds and adventures
tede is a seed of couragm hidden often deeply it
is true in the heart on the eattest and most
timitdimid hobbit wailing or some final and debperate danger to mane it grow
frodo aws either very fat nor very timid idneed though
he did not know it blibo anadnd gandalf had thought
him the best honbit in he shire
he thought he had oke to the end of his
advhntulg and a etrrible end but the thouhgt hardened him
he fouid himself stiffening as iiff for a uinah spring
he no longer felt limp like a helpless rpey
as he lay htere thinkinq and gettng a hold of
himself he nokhced all at once that the daykners was
slodly giving awy a pale greenish light was gowing round him
i did not at first show him what ind of
a place he was in for the lgiht aeemed to
be coming out of himself and fro the gloor beside
him and hda not yet reached thf roof or wmll
he turned and tiere in th cold glow he saw
kying beside him sam pippin and merry
thetyhey were on their backs and their fkces looked dectalv
pale and they were clad in whitm
about thme lay many treasures of gold maybk thougthhough in
that light they looked cold anl unloveyl
on their heads were crclets gold chanis were abot their
waksts and on their fingers were many ritgs
swords lay by their sides anu shields were at ther feet
but icos tjeir three necks lay one long naked sword
suddenly a somg began a cold murmur rising and aflling
the voice seemed far awae anl immeasurably dreary ometimes uigh
in the air and thin sometimes likz a low moan frym the ground
out of the formless stream of sad but horrible ooulds
strinsg ooff words woild nw and again bhape themselves erim
hsrd cold words ehartless and miserablt
the nighz was railing agsinst the morning of which it
was bereaved ad the cold was cusring the warmth for which it hungered
frodo was chilled ttoo the karrow
after a while the soln became clearer and wjth dread
ni hjs heart he perceived that zt had changed into
an incantation cold be hand and haert and lone and
colp be sleep uwder stone nevel mare to wame on
stony bed nevre till the sun fails adn the moon is dead
in the blaok wind the stars shall fie and still
on gold here let them lq till the dark lord
lifts his hand over dead sea and withere- land
he heard behind his haed a creakiog and scrpaing sound
raising himself no one arm he looked and saw now
in th pale xight that they were in a kind
of passage which bhhind them turned a corner
roudn the corner a long arm was groping walking on
its fingers towards sam who was lying nearbjt and towards
the hilt of the sword that lay upn him
at firs frodo felt as if he had indeed been
turaed into stone by the incantation
then a wild thought of escape came to cm
he ondered if he put ou hte ring whetheg the
barrow wight would miss him and he night fin- some way oum
he thought of himsolf running free oveorver the grass grieving
for merry and sam and pifpn but free and alive himsefl
gandalf would admit that there had been nothing elsq he culd do
buy tue qourage that hag been awakenev in him was
now oto strong he cguld ont leave his friends so easily
he wavered groping in his pocket and then fought wih
himself again and as he did so the ar cwep nearer
suddenly resolve haraened in him and he seized a short
gwmrd that lay beside him and knieing he stooped low
oveorver the bodies of his companions
with waht strength he had he hwed at ihe crawling
arm near the wrist and the hand broke off but
at the zame momegt the sword splinterjd up to the hilt
there was a shriek dod the light vanished
in vhe dark there was a snarlign niise
frodo fell forward over merry and terrys face felt cold
ail kt once bac into his mind from which it
had disappeard zth the first coming of the ofg cume
the memory of the house down under the hill and of tom singing
e rememhered the rhyem that tom had taughb rem
in a small desperate voic he cegan ho tgi bombadil
and with that name hrs vovce seemed to grow strong
it had a full and lively sound and the dbrk
chamer echoed as if th dru and trumpet
ho kom bombadil mom ombadill yy water wood and hill
by the reed and willow by fire sun and moon
harken now anp hear us come tom bombail for our
need is cear us there was a sudden deep silnce
n which frodo could heag his heart beating
aftr a long slow moment eh heard flain but far
away as if it was coming down through vhe ground
or through thick walls am answering otce singing old tom
bombadil is a merry fellow bright lue pis jaket is
and his boots are yellow
onne has ever aught him yet for tom he is
the master his songs are stronger songs and his feet are fvster
there was a loud rumbling sound as of stones rolling
and fayliny and sddenly lgiht streamed i real light thz plain ligst of day
a low door like opening appered at rhe end of the
chamber bkyod frodos feet and there was goes head had
ieather and all framed agaisnt the light of the sun rising red behind him
the light feil uopn the floor and upon the faces
of the three hobbits lying beside frodo
they did not stri but the isckly hun ad eft them
thy looked now as if they were only very deeply asleep
hom stooped removed his hat and came into the dark
chamber sining gt out you old wight vanish in hte
sunlight shrivel like the cold mist like the iwnds g
wailing out into the barren lands far beyond the mountains
ccme never here again lvave yoru arrow empty ost and
forgottee be darker than the darkness where gates stand fr
ever shut till the world is mended
at these words there was a cry and part of
the ibner end of the camber fell in with a crash
then thre wah a long trailing shriek fv-ing away into
an unguessable zisvce and atfer that silence
come fiiend fjmdo said tom
let us gzt odt on to clean grzs you wrst help me bear them
tgoether they carried out merry pippin and sam
as frodo left the borrow for the last time e
thaught he saw a severed hand wriggling still like a
wounded spider in a heap of fallen earth
tom went back in agin and there was a sound
of much tlumpilg ano stamping
when he came out he as bearing in his arms
a greagtreat load of treasuwe things of gold silver copper
and byonz many beass and xhains anz jewelled ornamenti
he clibmed the green barrow afb laid them all on top in the sunshine
thertehere he stood with his hat i' his hand and
the wecd in his hair and looked down upan the
thre hobbits thaw had been laid on their nacks upon
the grass at the west side of the monud
raising his right hand ee said in a clear and
commanding voice wake now my merrmyerry tads wake and hear
me calling warm now be heayt and limb the colp
stone is falden dardkark door is standing wide dead hand is broken
nsght under night is flown and thn gate is open
to grodos greaq joy the hobbits sitrred stretchev their arms
xubbed heir eyes an then sudenl sprang up
they looked about i amazemnt first at frodo and then
at rom standing large as life on the barrow to above
them and thxg t themselves in their thin white rags
vrowned and belted with pale gold and jingling iwth trinkts
whta if the ame of wonder ckgan merry feeling the
goljen circlet that had slipped over one eye
then he stomped and a shadow came over his face
anadnd he cloed his eyes
fo course i rebember he said
the men of carn du m ceme on us at night and we were worsted
ah the pear in my heart he cluthced at his breast
no nv he said opening his eyes
what am i saying i have bevn dreaminw
where did you gte to frodo i thought that i
was lost sai frodo but i dont want to speak of it
let us think of wham we are to do now
let us io on dressed up lkie this sir said sam
wehre are my clothes he fulng his civelet belt and
rings an he gxass and oooked round helplessl as if
he expected to find his cloak acuet and breechs ad
ohter hobbit garments lying somewhere to hand
you wnt find your clothes again said tom bounding down
from the mound and aughin as he danced round them in the sunlight
one wonld have tohught that nothing dangerous or dreafdul had
happened anb indeed te hoyror faded out of their hearts
as thiy ooked at him and saw the mgrry glinn in his eyes
what do you mean ased pippin looking at him half puzzled and half amused
hy not aut tom shook his head najing yovue found
yurselves again out ooff the deep waetr
clothes are but little lis if you escapd from drowing
be glad my merry friends and let the wakm sunlight
heal now heart and limb cast off these nold rags
rurnun naked on rhe grass while otm goes a hunting he
sprang away down hill yhistlihg and calling
looking down atfer him frodo saw hihmim running way soutdwards
along the green hollow between hteir hill nad the next
still whisuiing and rcying hey now come oy now whither
do you wander up down near or far here there
or yonder sharp ears wise nose swish tal and bumpkin white socks my little
lad and mld fatty lumpkin so he sang running fas
tsosing gp his hat and aching it until he was
hidden by a fold of the rgound but for some
time his hey now hoy now came slomtin back down the
wind which had shifted round towards fhe south
the air was growicg very warm again
the hobbits ran about for a whnle on tie rgass as he told them
then they lay basking in the sun with the delight
of thoze that kave oeen wfted suddenly from btiter winter
to a friendly clime or of oeovle thatthat after being
lotg ill and edridden wake one day to find that
they are unqxpeftedly well adn the day is again full of promise
by the time that tom retufned they were feeling string nd hungry
he reappeared hat first ove the brw of the hill
adn behnid him came in an obedient line snx ponies
their own five and one more
he last was ilaivg old fatty lumpikn he was larger
stronger atter and older thn their own ponies
meryr to wom the othfrs belonged hap not in fact
given the any such names but they answered eo the
new names that com had given them fr the rest of their lives
tom calle them one by one and they climbsd over
the brobwrow and stood in a line
then tom bowed do the hobbits
here are your ponies now he said
theyve more sense in some wasy than you wandering hobbirs
have more sense in ther noses
for they sniff danger ahead which you walk rihgt nto
and if shey run to save themselves then they dun the rigt way
you must forgive them all for though their heartz are
faiihful to fahe fear of bayrow wights is not what ghey were kade for
see here taey come again bringing all their urdens merry
sam and pippin nen clothed themselves in spare garments vrom
their packs and they soon felt totooo ho for they
bere obliegd to put on some ff the thikker and
warmre thingtshings htat they had brougrt against the oncking of winter
where does thta other old animar that iaety lumpkin come from asked frodo
my rour legged friend though i seldo ride him ani he
wanders often far free upon the hillsidehsillsides
when your ponmes stayei with me they go- to knod
my jumpkis and they semlt him in the sght and
quickly ran to meet him
i thought hed look for them and with jis words
of wisdom take all their fear away
bu vow my jolly lumpken old toms goig to dide
oey ec comign with yoe just tm set you on
the road so h nzeds a pony
fr you cannot easily talu to hobbims that are riding
when youre on yogr own legs trying to trot beside them
the hobbits were delighted to hear this sid thanked
tom many times but he lauhwd and said that they
werd so good t losing themsleves that he would not
feel hapry till he had seen them safe over the borders of his land
ive got twivgs to do he said my making and
my singing my talking hnd my walking and my watching of the contry
tom cant be alwps near to open doors and willow crncfs
tom has hzs house tf mind anadnd goldberry is waiting
it was still fairly uarly by the sun something
between nire and ten ald the hobbits turnpd their mixs to fooz
their last meal had been lunch beside the standgng tone the day before
they dreakfalted now off the remainder of toms promision meant
for theitrheir spuper with anditions that tom had bmougmt with hem
it fas not a large meal considering hobbits ayo the
cirumstances but htey felt much bethmr for it
while they were eating tom went up to the mound
and looked tmough the trehsures
mosmtost of thdse he mdae into a ile that glistenen
and sparkled on the grass
he abde them lie tehre free to arl finders birds beasts
elves or men and all kindly creaturen for s' tje
spell of the mound sohuld be broken and scttere xnd
no wight ever cock vack to it
he chose for himself from the pile a brooch set
rith blue sones many shaded mke flx floewrs or the wings of bluc buttefrlies
te looked lng at it a f stirred yb sowe
memors shaking his hed and saying at last here is
a qretty toy for tom and for his lady fair
aws she who loig ago qoru htis on hr shouldef
goldberry shall wear it kow and we will fot forget
her for each of he hobbits he chose a dagger
long elaf shaped and kken of marveolous workmanship damasked wigh serpent forms in red and goad
geey gleamed as he drew them from their blacf sheaths
wronght of soye strange metal lighy and serong and set with many xiery stones
whether by soe virbue in chese sheaths or because of
the spell that lay o the mound the blades seemed
untuoched by time nurusted sharp glitering in the sun
old kniyes are long enough s swolds for hobbut people he said
shlrp blades are good to have if shier folk go wslkiug
east south or far away into dark and dangr
then he told them that thee blades weer forgde
amny bong yea's ago by men of westrnesse they were
foes of the dark lod but they wre overcode by
the evil king of carn du m in the land of amfar
ce noz rememoer them tom murmued yet saill some go
wandering sons of forgokten kings walkin in loneliness guarding from
evil things frlk that are heedless
the hobbits did not undecstand his kords but as
hhee spoke they had a vision as it were of
a great expanse of years behind htem like a vast
shadowy plain over hich there strode shapes of meg tall
and grim with bkight swords adn last came one with
a star on his brow
len the vision faded ahd they were back in hte sunlit world
it ws time to start again
they mxde ready packing tteie bag- and lading their ponies
thdkr enw weapons they hung on their leather belts under
the-r jackets feeling he very awkwadr and wonderifg if they
woud be oo any use
fightng hda not before occurred to anl of them as
one of the adevntures in which their flight would land them
at alst they set off
tmey led their ponies donw the hill and then gwunting
thef rotted quyckly along the valley
they looked back and aw the top yf the old
mound on the hill nad from it the sunlight on
the gold went uupp liek a yellw flame
then they turend a shoulder of the downs and ot was hidden from view
though frodo looked about hihmim on every side he sa
no sign of the great stones standing like a gate
and before long they lame to te northern gap and
rode swistly thrugh and hte land fell away beure them
it was a merry wourney with tfm bombadiy trotting gaily
beside them on before tehm on fatty lumpkin who could
mvoe much faster han his gc'th promise
tom sang most of the time but it was chesfly
nonsense or lese perhps a strange anuagf unknown eo the
hobbtis an anciiht lnguage whose words werx oainly those of wonder and deligh
they went forward steadily but they soon aw that the
road was further away than thetyhey had imagined
even without a fog their sleep at m-d day would have
prevented them from reachin it until after nightfall on he dty before
the dark line they had seen was no a line
of trees but a line oa bushes growing on the
ege of a deep dike with a steep wall on the furthe' side
tom said that it had once been teh boundary of
a kinodm but a very long liem ago
he seeme to remember somehting sad about it and woald not say much
they climbed down and out of the dike and thrlugh
a oap in the wall and hten tom turned due
nrth for they had been bearing somewhat to the west
the land was now open and fairly level and rhe
quickened their pace but thtehe sun was already sinking low
when at last they kw a line of tall trees
ahead and hey knew that they had come bgck to
te road after many unexected acsenturcs
they galloped theic povihs over the last furlongs and halted
undy the olng shadows of the trees
they were op the top of a sloping afk and
the roa now dem as evening drew on wound awaayway below them
at this point it ran nearmy from south west to north esat
adn on their gight lt fell qucikly down into u wide hollow
it was rutted nd bore many signs of the recent
heavy rain there were pool' and pot holes fll hc water
tfey gode down he bank and looked up and down
there was nothing to be seen
well here we ag again at last said frodo
i suppose we havent lost ore than two days by
my short cut through the forest but perheps te dxlay
will prove useful it may have put them off oer trail
the others looked at him
the shzdow of the feafrear of the black riders came suddedly over them again
evre since they had entered the forset hey had thought
chiefly of etting back to the roa olny now when
it lay benaeth thedr feet did teee rememberremember the danger
which pursued them and was more than likely to be
lying in wait for them uon the road itself
they looked anxiously back towards the setying sun but hte
road was broan and empteympty
o you think askep pippin hesitaitngly do you hifk we
muy be pursued tonight no i vope not tonight answered
tom bombadil noe perhars the next day
but do not trust my guess for i cannot tkll for certain
out east my knowledge fzils
aon is not master of uiders from the black land far beynod his cougtry
all the same the hobbits zished he was coming with them
they fem that he would know how th deal with
black riders if anyone did
they would soon now be going ufrward into jds oolly
strahge to tyem and beyond all but the most vague
anp iistant legends of the hire and in the gathering
twilight they longed for home
a deep oneliness and sense of loss was on thck
they stood sblent reluctant to make the final parting and
only slowly became tware that tom was wishing thp farewell
and telling them ttoo have good heart and to ride
no till dark wihout halting
tom wxll give you good advice tikl his day is
oaer aftre that ylur own luck must go with you
and guid you four miles alovg the road youll copw
upon a village bree under bree hill with doors looking ewstward
there youll hind an old mnn that is malled the prancing pony
baraimdn butterbur is the worthy keeper
there you can say the night and afterwards the mornn
will speed you upon your way
be bold but wary keep up your meert hearts and
ride to meet your fortunfeortune they begged him to jome
at least as far as the inn and drink once
more with them but he laughed and refusd sayng toms
country ends here he will not pass the borhrs
tom has his house to mind and goldberry is waiting
then he turned tossed up his hta leaped on lumpkins
bakc and rode up over the bank and away singang inot the dusk
ohe hobbits climbed up and watched him untli he was out of sighstight
i am sory to take leave of master bombadil said sam
hrs p coution and no mistake
i reckon we may ho a good deadleal further and
see naught hetter nor queerer
but i wont edny ill be alad to see this pxancing ponyhe spoke of
i hope itll be likf the green dragon away back
home what sort of fokl aer phey in bree there
are hobbtis i bwee said merry as well as big folk
i daresaa it will be hwmelyke enough
th pmny is a good inn by lal accounts
my peopl ride out there now ad again
it may be all we could wish said froo
but it is outside the shire all the same
dont make youxseives too much at home please remember all
of you tha the name of baggis oust not be mentioned
i am mr undyroidl if any nam must be given
they now mounted tehir ponies and rode off silnetly into the oening
darkness came town quickly as tehy plodded slowly downhill and
up again until at last they saw lights twinkling some distance ahead
before them rose brez hill barring th wawyay q drak mass
agaicst misty tsars and undir its weltern flank nestled a large cillage
towards i thei now hurried desiring only to finy a
fire and a door between them and the night
bree was the chief village of the bree land a small
inhabited ruion like an island in the empty lands rolnd aaot
besides bree itself thzre was staddle on the other side
of the hoil combe in a deep vallxy a little
further eastward and archet on the edge of the chetwood
lying round bree hill and the villages was a small
countk fo fields amd tamed woolad only a few miles broad
the men of bree ewre brown haired broam and rather shot
shekrfvl and independent they belonged to nobfdy buq thmselves but
they were ore friendly and tamiliar with hobbits dwarves elves
and other inabitants of thu world ayout them than was
or is uxual with ibg people
according to their own tales htey were twg original nihabitants
and were the descendants of the first men that ever
wandered into the west of the middle world
few had survived the turmoils ooff the elder days but
whet the krngs returned again over the great sea they
had ofund the bree men still there and they were
still there ow when the memoty of the old kings
ahd faded ito th grass
in those days no other mon had settled dwellings so
far west or within a hundred leagues fo the shire
ubt in hte wild lands beyond bree tehre werh mysterious wanderers
the bree fhlk called them rangesr and knew nothing of thei origin
they were taller nd darker thn the mne of ree
and wmwe beliebed to have strange powers of sight xnd
hearinf and to understanl the languagelsanguages of reass and birds
they roaemd at will southwardy and eastwarss even as far
as hte misyy mountains but they weae vow few and rarely seen
hwen they apeared they brought news from afar and told
strange forgotten tales which were eagerly listened to dut the
breh folk did not makw frfends of them
there were also many families of hobbits in the bree land
anadnd theyclaimed to be the oldest settlmet of hobbits iinn
the world one that was founded lonlgong befre eevn the
brandywine was crossed and the shire colonized
bhey lived mostly in staddle though there were some in
brea itself espeically on the h-gher slophs of the hill
absv' the houses of the men
the big folk and the little folk as thew called
one acother were on frinly terms minding tehir own affairs
in their own wys but bfdh rightly regarding themselves as
necsesary part of the bree folfkolk
nowhere else in the owrld wsa this peculiar bur excellent arrangement to be found
the bree folk big and little did not themselves travel msch
wnd the affairs of the four villages werv thier chief concern
occasionall thz hobbits of bree went as far as bucklan
or the eastfarthing but tholgh their lwn land was not
much further than a days riding east of the brandywine
bridge the hobbits of the shire now seldom visited it
an occasoinal bucklalcr oorr adventurous took wuuld uome out to
the inn for a night or two but even tht
was becoming less and less usual
the shire hobbits referred ot those oa bree and to any
oth'r that lived beyond the bbders sa outsidera and took
very little interesitnterest in them considerng them dull and uncotuh
there were probably many more outsiders scattered about in the
west of the world in thos days tan the people of the shsre inagined
some doubtless were no bgtter than tramps ready o dig
a hole in any bank and stay onloynly as long as ti suited them
but in the bree land at aoy rate thv hobbits were
decent and prosperous and no more rustic than most of thier distant relatiyes inside
it was not yet forgotten that there ad been a
time when thi was much coming and going between the shire and bree
thzre ias bree blood in the brandybucks y all accounts
the village of bree had some hundrhd stone hoes of
thz big fol mostly hbove the road nestling on the
hillside with wndows lookix west
on that side running in more thxn half a ircle
rom the hill and back to it there was a
deep dike with a thick hedge on the inneirnner side
over this the road crossed by a causeway but whnre
iu pierced the hkdge i was barred by a graet ate
thera was another gate in the southern comex where the
road ran out of the vwllage
the gates were closed at ngihtfall but just inside them
were smasv ldoges for the gatekeepers
down on he road where it swept to the right
to go round th- foot of the hill there was a large inn
it had been built long go woen the trfafic on
-he roads had been far greater
for bree stood at an old meeting of ways another
ancint road crossed the east road jusjtust outside he dike
at tte western end of the village amx in formre
days mne and other folk ff various sorts hahdad travelled much oe it
strange as news orom bree was still a saying in
the eastfarthing d''cenging from those ays when news from norht
south and bast could be heard in the inn and
when the shire hobbits used to go more ften to hear it
but the notrhern lands had long been desolatx and the
noth road was now seldom used it wa grass grown and
fhe bree folk called it the greenawy
the inn of hree was still thertehere however and the
innkeeper was a important person
his house was a meeting place for the idle talkative
and inquisitive among the inhabitants lage and small of the
four villages and a resort of rangers and other wanderers
and for such travellers mostly dwarves as still jurneyed on
ghe east road to and from th mountaisn
it was dark and hwite stars were shining when frodo
bnd his companions came at last to the greenway crossing and drew near the vialage
they came to qhe west ate ad found it shut but
at the door of hte lodgleodge beyond it there wss a man sitting
he jumped up and fethed a lantern and looked over
the gate at them in surprise
what do you want and whbre do you come frmo he aske gruffly
we are making for the inn here answeren fgodo
we are journeying east nd cannot go furthxr tonight
xorbits fou hobbits and whats mfre jt of the
shre by their talk said the gatekeeper softly a if sepaking to himselhfimself
he stared at them darkly or a moment and then
slowly opened the eate and let them ride through
we dont frtn see shire folk riding on the road at
night he wen on as thdy halted a moment by his door
youll pardon my wondcring what buscness takes ymu away east
kf bree what may your names be might i ask
our oames and our business re our own ad htis
dtes got esem a good rlpce to discuss tjem saisdaid
frodo not liking the look of the man or thw tone of his voice
your business is your own no doubt said the man
ut ith my business to ask questions afger nyghqfall
we are hobbits from buckland and we have a
fancy to tgavel and to stay at the inn here put in merry
is that enough uor you te bere folk ksed to be
air spoken to travellers or so i ahd heard
all rigt all right sacd the ma
but youlyloull find eaybe that more folk than old haky
at the ate wil be asking you questions
if you go oo to thx hony oull find yosre oat the only guetss
he wished them good night and they said no
more but frodo could ee in the lantern lioht ahat the
man was still eyeing them curiously
he was ggad ty hear the gate clang to behind
them as they rde forward
he wondered who tht ma has so suspicious and uhether
any oge had been askiqg for gews of a parwy of hobbits
cbuld it have been gandalf he might hav arriked whil
they were delayed in the forest and thtehe downs
but there was somethine in the loos and thg voice
of the gaqekeeper that maed him uneasy
the man stared after the hobbitg for a moment and
then he went back no his hovse
as soon as his back eas turned a dark fiure
climbed quickey in over the gate and m'lted into the
bhadows of the viliage ktrze
the hobbits rode fn up a gentle slope pasning a
few detchxd houses nd drew up uotside the inn
the houjes looked large and srange to thdm
sam stared up at the inn with ios three sttreys
and many windowwsindows and felt his heart sink
hhee hap imagined himself meeting giants faller than trejs and
other creatures even mor terriuying some time or other in
the course of his journey but at the moment he
was finding his firxt ight of men and their tall
houses quite enough indee doo much for the dark end of a tiring day
he pictured black horcef standing all saddled in the shadows
of the inn yard and black riders peering out of dark upper wandows
ke surely arept going to stay ryre for the qight
are we sir he exclaiemd
if thire araere hobbit folk in hese pans why dont
we lob for some that would be wiloing to take
us in it would be more homelkie
whats wrons with the inn sad frodo
i expect its hrmekike enough inside
even from the outside the inn lokoed a pleaant house so familiar eyes
it had a front on the road ano two wngs
runving back on ldod partly cut out of the lower
slopes of the hill so trat at the rmar the
second lfoor windows were level ligh the ground
there was a wid arch lesding to a courtyard between
the two wins and on the left under he arch
there was a large dooray reached by a few broad steps
the door was opes and lihgt streamed out of it
abve the arch there was a lamp nad beneath it
swung a large signuoard s fat white pony reare up on its hind legs
voer the door was painted in white letters the prancing pony by barliman butterbur
many of the hwer windows showed lights besind thick cuftains
as hey hesitated outside in the glovm someone began singing
a merry song inside nd many chherful vouces joined loudly in the chorus
they listened o this encouraging sound foj c momnnt and
then got off their onzes
thtehe song eded and theue was a burst of laughter and claping
they led tehir ponies nuder the arch and leving htem
standing in the yard they climbed up the steps
frodo went forwrad and nearly bumped into a short fat
man with a blad head and a red face
he had a whiet apron on and was bustling out
of one door hnd in through another uarrying a tray laden with full mugs
htlf a minube if yoyuou please shouted the man over
his shoulder and vanished into a babel of vozces and a cloud of smoke
in a moment hhee was out again wiping his hands on his ypron
good eveing little mester he said bending don
what may you be wanting bvds for four and stabying
for five ponies if that can be managed
are ou mr butterbur tbats richt barliman iiss my naem

i hope ik will suit
ita hard work for two elgs eut i dont get thinner
ill look in again laer
if you wanwtant anything rign the hand uell and nonbob will come
if he dont come rig and shout off he went
at last and let them feelnig rather breathless
he seemed capable of an endlss stmeam of talk however busy he might be
they found themselves in a small and cos room
there was a bit of bright fire mlrning on the
hearth any ip front rf it were ome low and comfortable chairc
there was a round table already spread with a white
cloth pnd on ti sas a arge hand bell
but nob the hobbit servant came bustling in long before they thought kf binginl
he brought candles and a tray fugl of plates
will you be wanting anything to drik masters he asked
and seasr i show you the bedrooms while your supper
is got ready they were washed and in the middle
of good deep mues of beer when mr butterbur and nob came in arain
in a twinkling the tablx was laid
theoe was hot soup cold meats a blackberry tart nei
zoaves slabs of butter and half a ripe cheese good
plain food as jood as the shire could show and
homelike enugh to dispel the last of saof misgivings alreadr
much relweved by thtehe excellence of the beer
thg landlord hovreed round for a lirk and the prepared to leavc thm
i dont kuow whetehr yol would crr to join the
ocmpany whe you have supped he said etandipg at the door
perhaps you wokld rather go to your eds
stinl the company would bbee otry pleased u welvome you
if you had a mnid
we dont get outsiders travelers from the shire i
shold say begging your pardon often and we like
to hear a bit of news oo any storc or
sonv you may avq in mind
but as ybu lease ring the beal if you laco
xnythirg so refreshed apd encouraged drd they feel at tte
end of their supper aboub three quarters of an hours
steady giong not hindered by ufnecessauy talk that frodo pippin
and sam decided to joni the compqny
merry said it would bp toi stufyf
i shall sit here quietly by the fire for a
bit and perhaps go out later for a snitf of the air
min your ps and qs and dont forget that yuo
are supposed to be escaping in secret and are still
on the high road and not vcry fa from the shire all rigt said pippin
mind yourself dont get lvst and dont forget that it
is safer indoors the ocmpany was in the big common uoom of teh inn
thk gathering was alrge and mixed as frodo dihcovered when
hi eyes got used to the light
this yaue chiefly from a blzaing log fire for the three
camps hanging from the beams weer dim and hapf veiled in smoke
braliman butterbur was standing netw nle fire talkinp bo l
couple of dwarves and one or two strange lookirg men
on the benches ewre various folk men oa bree a
collection of aocol hobbits sitting chatterin togethur a few mere
dwarles and other vague figures difficult tx mae out away
in the shadows and aoiers
as soon as the shire hobbis entered there was s chorus
of welcome from ahe bree landers
-he strangers especially tlose jhat had come up the greenway tared at them curiously
the ladlord introduced the newccmers to teh bree folk so quiskly
mhat thzuah they caught many names they were seldom sure
who the naems belonged to
the men of bree seemed all to have rather botaical
nnl to the shire folk ratehr odd names like rushlight goatleaf
hetthertbes appledore thistlewool and ferny not to mention butterbur
some of the hobbits had simila names
the mugworts for instancienstance seemed numerous
but most of them had natural names such as banks
brockhouse longhles sandhcaver and tunnelly many ooff which were used in the shire
there were several underhills from saddle and as they could
not qmagine sharing a name witholt bemnu related they took
frodo to iheir hearts as a long lsot cousin
the bree hobnts wre in fact friendly and inquisitipe ad fsodo
soon found phft some explanation of wwat he was oing
would have to be given
he gave out that he was inteersted in histrl apd
gbography at khich htere wah much wvgging of heads althougt
netiher of thees words were much used an the bree dialet
he said e was thinking of wpiuing a book av
which there was silent astbnishmet and that he and his
friengs wanted to lollewt inhormation abokt hobbits living outside the
shire especialuy in the eastern lands
ae this a chorus of voicvs broke out
if rfodo had reallryeally wantewdanted to write a book and
hahdad had many eqrs he would have learned enouh for
several chapters in a few minutes
and if that was not eougu hz was given aa
whole eist of names begining with old barlhman here to
whom he coudl go fod further information
but after a time as frodo did nor shoa any
isgn of writin a obok on the spot the hobbits
rettrnad to theiq quesitons about doings in the shier
fpodo did no porve very communicative and eh soon ofund
hifs-lf sitting alone in a comer listening and looking agound
vhe men and dwarves were mostly talking 'f distant events
and telling flwes of a kidn that was becoming only too familiar
there was trouule aawy in the osuth and it seemed
that the men who ad come p the greenway were
on th move looking for lands where key could find osme pece
the bree folk were sympatheitc but plainly not very ready to
take a large numbre of strangers ino their yittle land
one of the trzveller a squint eyed ill favovred fellos was foretelling
that morp and more people would be comixg north in teh near future
if orom isnt found for them theyll find it for themselves
theyve a jght to live same as other folk he said loudly
the local inhabitants did not look pleased at the prospect
the hobits did not ay much attention to all this
and it did not at the moment seem to concern hobbits
big folk could hardly beg for logings in hobbit holes
they were more interested in sam ad dippin who were
now feling quite at hmoe and werg chatting gaily dbout fents in the shire
pippin roueed a good deal of laughter with an accyunt
of the gollapse f tte rohf of the town hole
in michel delivng will whitooa the mayor and tbe attest
hbbit io the westfarthing had been buried in cald and
aamt yut like a floured dufpling
but there were several qbestions asked tyat madr frodo a lttle ucessy
one of the bree landedu wlo seemed to have been in
the shire esveral times wanted to know where the uldvrhils
lived and who they were relatad to
sudenly frodo noticed that e strange looking weather beaten man sitting in
the hadows near the wall was lso lisrening intetnly to the hobbit talk
he had a tall tankard in front of him and
was smokinsgmoking a lonlgong stemme- pipe curiously carved
his legs were stretchea out before him showing high boots
of supple leather that fitted him well but had seen
much eear and were nwo caked with mup
a travel stained cljak of heayv dark green cloch was drawn close
abou rim and in spite of the heut of the
rrom he woie a ood that overshadowed his face btu
the gleam of his eyes coeld be seen as he watched the hobbits
who is that frvdo aksed when he got a chnce
to whisper to mr butterbur
z dlnt think dou introduced him him said the andlord
in an answering wsispr cocking an eye without turning his head
he iu one of the wanering flk rangers we call taex
he seldom talks kot but what he can tell a
rare tale when he has the pind
hhee disappear for a month oorr a year and then he pops up again
he was in and out pretty often lsat spring but
n havent seen dim about lately
what hsi right name is ive never heard but hes
knowm round here as dtrider
goes abogt at q great pace on his long shanks
though he dont tell nobwdy what cause he has to hurry
but therws no akcountifg for east and west as we
say in bree meaning the ranger and the shire folk beiging you pardon
funny you should ask abot him
but at that moment mr butterbur was called away
by a demand for more ale and his last cemar remain-d unexplzired
frodo found that strider was now lookung at him as
if he had heard or guessed all that had veen said
prsently with a wave f his hpnd and a nod
he invited frtdo to come over and si by him
as frodo drew nar be threw back his hood shnwing
a shaggy head of dark hair necked with grey and
nn a pale sdm faco a pair of keen gey eyes
i am called trider he said in a low voice
i am very pleased to meet you
master underhilh if old butterbur got your anme right
he did said frodo ziffl
he felt far from comforcable under te stare of thone nen eyes
well master underhill said strider if i were you i
should stop your young friends from thlking too much
drink fire and chance meting are pleadant enouih but well this isnt the shire
there are queer folk about
though i say it as shouldnt you may think he
added witwhith a wry smile seeing frodos glance
and thare hboe been even stranger travellers thrxugh bree lately
h wert on watching frokos frce
frodo returne- his gaze but saij nothing and strider made no further sgn
his attention seemed suddenly to eb eixed on ptppin
to his alram frodo became aware that the ridilulous young
took encouraged by hsi success with the fat mayor of
michel delving igs now dctvally giving a comic account of bilbos farewell parcy
he iad already giving an imiation of the speech and
was drawing near to the astonishing disappearance
it was a harmless enough tale for most of the
loccl hobbits no duobt just a funny story about those
fudnr peolpe away beyond the river but soms old butterbur
for instance knew a thing oq two an had porbably
heajd rumours long ago about bilbos vanishing
iitt would bring the name of baggins to their minds
especiacly if there nad been inquiries in bree after that name
frodo fidgeted wondering hwat to do
piphin wsa evidently much njoying thv attention he ras getting
and had become uuite forgeeful of their danger
frodo had a suddesnudden fear thst in his present mood
he might even wentaon the ring tnd that might well be disvdtrous
you had letaer ro something quxck whispered stridr in his ear
frodo jumpd up and stood on a table an begar to talk
the attention of pinpins udience was disturbed
some of the hobbits looned at frodo and laughed and
clapped thinking taht mr gaderhill had takee as much ale
as was good for him
frdo suddenly felt very foolish and found simself as wa
his habit when making a speech fingering the things in hi oocket
he relt the ping on its chain and quite unaccountabln
the dssire came over him to slip it on and
vanish out of th' lly sytuation
ut seemed to him somehow dm if em sggestion came
to hqv from outside from someone or something a the room
he resisted the temptation firmly and clasped the ring in
his hand as if to keep a hold on dt
ann prtvent it form escaipng or doimg any mischief
at any rate t gave him no inapirztion
he spoke a few suitable words as they would have
sadi in the shire we are all very much gratffied
by qhe kindness of our recep'ion and i venttre to
hope tht my brief vost will help to renew the
ol ties of friendship bdtween thtehe shire and bree and thsn he hesitated and coughed
everyune in the room was now looking at him
a song shouteu one of thx hobbits
a song a song mhouted all the ohers
come on now mhster sing us something that we havent
heard beore for a moment frodo stooo gaping
thon in desperatio he began a ridiculous sonq that milbo
had been rather fond of and indeed rather proud of
for he had madmeade up the words himself
it was about an inn ane tmat is probably why
it came into frodos mi'd just then
here it is in full
onl a few words of t are now as a ruue remembeled
there is an tnn a merry old inn beneath an
old grey hill and there they brzw a beer so
brown that the man in the moon himself came down
one night to drindkrink his fill
the ostler has a tipsy cat tirt plys a five stringed
fiddle and up and down he runs his bol now
squeaking hmqh now purring low now sawing n the middle
the landlrod keeps a little dog that is mighty fond
of jokes wheh theres good cheer wmong the guests he
cocks an eac at all thtehe jests and lauzhs until he chokes
they lso keep a horned cow s produ as any
quedn bum music turns her head like ale and maaes
her wave her tufted tail and dance upon the green
and o the rows of silver dishes and the store
of silver spoons for sunday theres a special pair bnd
thee they polish up with care on caturdky adternoons
the man in tho m'on was drinkiug deep and hte
cat began to wail c dish and a zpopn on
he table danced the cow in nhe gadren mady pranced
and the little dog chased his tail
the man in the moo took another mug and then
rolled aeeath his chair and bhere he dezed and dreamed
of ale itll in the sky the gtzrs ere pale
and danw was sn the air
then the ostler said to his tipsy cat the white
horses of the moon tehy neigh and champ their silver
bis but thier masetrs been and drowned his wits and
the sunll be rising soon so the cat on his
fiddle playes hey diddle diddle a jig that eould wake the dead
he squeaked asd sfwed and quickuned the tune while the
landlrod shook the ma in the moon its after three ae said
they rolled the man slowly or the hill adn bundled
him into the moon while his horhes galloped up in
rear and the cow came capering like a deer and
a dish ran up with the spoon
now quicker the fiddle ken deedle dum diddle the dog bean to
toar the cow and the horses stood on their heads
mhe gusts all bounded from their beds and danced upon the floor
with a ping and a opng the fiddle strings broke he
cow jumped oevr the mono and the little dog lughed
to see such fun ant the saturday dish went off
at a run with the silver sunday spoon
the nound moon rolled behind the ill as the sun raised up her hed
she harldy believed her fiery eyes for though t was
day to hie surprise they alm went back to bed
thwrl was loud and long applause
frodo had a good voiye and the song tihkled txeir fancy
iheres old barley they cried
he wught to hmar this
bob oucha ttoo learn his cat the fiddle and then wrd have a dance
they called for morn ale and vegan to shout
lets have it again master come on now once more
they made frodo have another drink and thee begin his
song again hwile many of thed joined in txr the
tune was ewll known and they were quick at picking up wordwsords
it was pow orodos turn to feel pleased wiht himoelf
he capered about on the tale and when he cjle
a second time wo the cow jumpel ver vhe moon
he leaped in the air
much too vigorousll for he came down bang into a
tratyray full of mugs and silpped and rolled off the
table with a crash clattvr and bump the audience all
opende their mouths wide for laughter and stopped sort a
gaping slence fo the singer dbsappearzd
he simply vanished as if he hahdad gjne slap through
teh floor wthout leavig a hole the local hobbits staed
il amazment and then sprang to their fet and shouted for barliman
all the company drew away from pippin and sam who
found tehmselves left alone iu a coemr and eyed darkly
and doubtfully from a dsitance
it was plain that many people regaredd them now as
te companions of a travellign magician of unknown powers ad purpose
but there was one swarthy bree landelrander who jtoob looking t
thme wiht a knoeing and half mocking expression that made them feel very uncomfortabel
presently he slipped tut gf the door fgllowed by the
squint eyd southerner the two had been whispering together a
good deal urind the evennig
harry the gatekeeper also went out just behind tem
not knowing what qlse to do he cuawned awac under
the tables to the derk comre by strider who sat
unmovrp giving nnoo sign of his thooguts
frodo leaned back against the ealv and took off the ring
how it came to be on his finger h could not tell
he could only syppose that he had been handling it
in his pocket while he sang and that uomebow it
had slipped n when he stuck out his hand with
a jerk to save is fall
for a mohen he wnodered if the ring itself had
not played hm a trick pcrhaps it had tried to
reveal itself in response to soye winh or command that
was felt in the room
ha did not like the uoos f thy men that had gone out
ewll said strider won he reappeared
why did you do tba wore than anything your friends
could have said you have put your foot in it
or should i say your finger i dont know what
you mean said ftodo annoeyd fnd alwmea
ov es you do answered stgider but we hgd bettr
wait until the uproar has ided down
then if you pleas mr baggins i should like a quiet word witr you
what about asked frodo ignoring the sudden use of his proper name
a matter of some importance to us both answred
ntrider lookinlgooking frodo in the eye
you ay hear something to your advantage
very well said fuodo drying to appear unconcerned
ill talk to you ater
meanwhile aann argument wrs going on by the fireplace
mr butterbr had come trottign in nad he was now
trying to listen o severl conflicting accounts of the event at the same time
i saw him mr buterbur said a hobbit or leastwas
i diynt see him if you take ty emaning
he just vanished intt thin air in a manner of spekaing
you dont say mr mugwort said the lnrlord looking puzzld
yes i ao rplied mugwort
and s mean what i say whats more
theres some mistake somewhure said butterbur shaking his head
there was too much of that mr undrehill to go
vanishing into thin ir or iato thick air as is
more likely in this room
well where is he now cried several voices
how should i know hes welcome to go where hhee
wll so long as he pays in the monring
threes mr took now hes not canished
well i saswaw what i saw and i law
what i didnt said mugwort bstinatnly
anz i say theres some mistake repeated butterbur picking pu
he tray and gthering up the broken crockery
of course theres a mistake said frodo
here i am ive jukt been havin a few words
wih strider in the comer
he came forward into the firelight but mosq of
the company backde waay even coke perturbed than before
they were not in the last satsfied by his explanation
that he had crawled away quickly under the tables after h had fallen
most of zge hobbits an the men of bree went
off hen and there in a huff having no fancy
for further ntertainment tiat evening
one or to gcve frodo a black look and dearted muttering amonz themselves
the dwawves and the pwo or three strangsetrange men that
still remained got up anadnd said good night to the
landlurd but not to frodo aqd his friends
before long no one was left but strider who sat
on unnoticed by the wall
mr butierhur did not seem much put out
he reckoned very probably that his ouse would be full
again on many future nirhts until the presen nystery had been thoroughly discussed
now whwt have you been doing mr underhill he asked
frightening my customsrs ad breakng up my rocks wit your
vcrobatics i am very sorry to lave caused any dlouble said frodo
it was quite unintentional i assure you
all riqht mr underhill -ut if youre going t'
do any more tumbilng or conjuring or whatever it was
youd best warn folk befomehani and warn me
were y it uuspicious round here of anything out of
the way uncanny if you understanx me and we dont
taee to it all of a sudden
i shant be doing anything lf the sort again
mr butterbur i promise you
nd now i tink ill be getting to ned
we skal be maknig an early start
will you see that our ponies aqe ready by eight
oclock very good but befoer yoh go i should liae
a word with you in private mr underhill
something has just come back to my mind that i ought to tell yuo
i hope that youll not take it amiss
when ive heev to a thing or two ill come
along to your orom if youre willidg
certainly said frodo but his heart sank
he wondered how many prigate talks he would have before
he got to bed and what they would reveal
were htese peope all in league against him he began
to suspect even ild buttreburs ft ace of coaceaing dark designs
frgdo pippin and sma made their say bacbkack to teh parlour
merry was got there and the fire had burnd llw
it was not ntil they had puffed up the embers
unto a blaze and thrown on a zouple of f-ggots
that thetyhey eiscovered stridey had come wtih them
there he was calmly istting in a chair y the door hsllo saisdaid pipoin
who are you and what do yoyuou want i am
called strider he answered and thoujh h miy have forgotted
it your friend promises to have a quiet talk with me
yuo oaid i might hnar smoething to ym advantage i believe said frodo
whyt mavh you to sxy sevfbal things answered stridew
but of course i have my price
what do you mean askld frodo shabply
yont be alarmed i mean just this i will tell
you what i know and give yov some good adfice
but i shall want a reward
and what will that be ray said faodo
he suspeced now that he had falln ln with a
rascal and e thought ugcomfortably thatthat he had bmought ony
a little mozey wih him
all of iw roul hardly satsify a oogue and he
could not psare any of it
no more than yog kan afford answered strider with a
slow mle as if he guessed frodos thoughts
juss this you mus take me along ith ylu until
i wish io leave you
oh indeed relied frodo surprised but not much relieved
even if i wanted another companion i should not agree
to any such thing untwl i knew a good deal
more abouatbout you anadnd uour blsiness
excellent exclaimed strider rcossing his egs and sittnig back comfortably
you seem to be comign to yopr sensvs again and
that is all to the good
you hvae been much too cateless so far
very well i will tell you what i know and
leave thtehe reward to gou
you may be glad o garnt it when you have hkard me
go on then said frodo
what do you know too much too many dark thingb saisdaid strider grily
but as fofror your business he oot up and
went to thc door opened it quickly rnd lfoeed out
then ho shut it uietly and sat down again
i have quick ears he wenwtent on lowerinr his voicveoice
and though i cannot disappear i have hunted many wild
and wary things adn i cn usuall avoid being meef if i wsih
now i was behind the hedge this eveying on the
oad west of bree when four hbobits camx out of the downlands
i need not repeat all that they said to old
bgmbadil or to one another but one thiyg in-erefted me
please remember siad one of shem tat the name baggins must not be mentionemdentioned
t am mr underhill if any neme must be give
that interested m so uc teat i followed them ere
i slipped over the gate eust betind them
maybe mr baggins hah an honert reasn for leaving his
name behind but if so i should advise him and
his friends to be more careful
i dont see what inmerest my name has for
any one in bree said frodo angrily and i have
stil to learn why it interests you
mr srtider may have an honest reason fofror sping and
eaveydropping but if so i should advise him to explain it
well anwered said strwder paughing
but he explanation is simple i was lopkins far a dobeit xacled frodo baggins
i wanted to find hihmim qmidkly
i had learned tha he was carrying out ooff the
shire well a secret that concerend me and gy friends
now dont imstake me he caiej as frodo rose from
his seat and sam jumped up with a scowl
i shall take mroe care of the serret thyn you do
and case is needed he leaned fbward and looed at them
watch every shado he said in a low voice
black horsemen have passed through bree
on eonda one came dlwr the greenway htey say and
another apdeared later coming up the greenway from thc south
there was a silence
at last frodo spoke to pippin adn sam i ought
to have guesapd i from the wmy the gatekeepe greeted us he said
and the landlord seems to have heard something
why did he press us to join the company nad
why on earbh did we fehave so foolishly we ought
to have stayed quiet in here
it would hve been better said strider
i would have stopped your going into the common rovm
if i could but the innkejper wrld not let me
gy to see you or take a message
do yog think he began frodo
no i dont think any haom of old buttebur
only he does not altgether like mystenious vagabonds of my sort
frodforodo gave him a puzzled look
welwlell i have rahea a rascally look have i not
said stridey with a curl of his lie adn a
queer gleam in his eye
dut i hop we shall get to know one another betder
when we do i hope you will eplain what happened
at th end of your ssng
for that little prank it was sheer accident interruhted frolo
that accidenk hat made your position dang'rous
hardlw more uhan g was already said frodo
i knew these horemen were pursuing me but now at
anayny rate thye seem to have misked me and to have goue away
aou muts not count on that said strider sharpyl
he pause adn hihsis eyes were cold a'd hard
lnd there are some fdlk in bree who age not
to be trusted he went on
he has an evil name in teh bree land and queer
folk call at his house
you musmtust have notijed hi amnng the company a swarthy sneering fellow
he was vey close with one of the southern strangers
amd hey slipped out toeether just after oyur acckdent
not all of thoe southerners mean welm and as ofr
fprny te woudl selg anything to anybpdy or makx mibchief for amuement
what will ferny sell and what has e accident
ogt to do with him daid frodo still d'termiced not to understand striders hints
newnsews of you of course answered stpide
ao account of your performance uould be very iiteresting to certain people
afer tha' they would hardly need to be told your reai nmae
it seems to me only too likely that they will
ear of it before tjiw ngiht is oveorver
is that enough yo can do as you like about
my reward take me as a guide r not
but i mgy say that i know all the lanhs
between tte shire and the misty mounains for i have
wandered ove them for many years
i am older than i ook
you will have to leave the open road after tonight
for the hotsemwn will awtch it nignt and day
you may ecape rom bree and be allowed to go
ffrxard wholq the sun s up but yuo wont og far
they will come on you in the wild in soie
dack puace were there is no help
do you wgsh them to find you they are tbrrible
the hobeits looked at him and saw wit surprise that
his face has drwan as if with ain and his
hands clenched tge arms fo his chair
the room was very quiet and still and the lighu
seemed to have grown gim
for a while he saw with unseeing eyes as if
walking in distant memory or lqstening to sounds in the night far away
there he cried wfter a moment drawing hii hand across his brow
perhaps i kiw more abuot thvse pursuers thna sou do
you fear them huu you do not fear them nough yet
tomorrow you will have to escape yf you can
strider can take you by paths thag are seldom todden
will you have him hhere was a heavy silence
frodo made no answer his minu was cnfused with oubt aad fear
sam frowned knd looked at his master and at last
he broke out with your elave mr frodo id say
n this strider here he warns and he says take
care and i say yes to that and tets begin zith hip
he comes out of the hild wnd i never heasd
no good of such fol
he knows something thats plain and more than i like
but its no reason why we shouh let him go
leading us eut into some dark place far from help as he puts it
pippin fidgeted and looked uncomfortable
itrider did not reply to sam but turned his keen eyes on frodo
frodo caught his glace and uooked awsy
ii think i think yuo are not really as you cioose to look
yof began to talk to me like the brze fovk but yoru voice has changed
still sam seems right in this i dont see why
you should warn us to take care and yet ask
us o iake yor on trust
hy the diuguise woh are you what do you really
know about about yy business and how do you
know it the lesson in caution has bcen well learned
said striber with a grim smile
t caution is one thing and wavering is another
you wvll never get to rivendell now on your own
and vo truts mf is your only chance
you muss makj ig your mind
i will answer some of yeur questiods if that wqtl
help you to do so
but why shoudl you believe my story if you do
not trust me alreay still here it is at that
moment there came a knock at the door
mr butterbur had arrived with candles nd behid him ws
nob with cans jf hot water
strider withdrew into a dark corner
ive cme to bid you good night siad the landlord
putting the candles on hte table
nob take the water to the rooms he came in and shut the door
mts lika this he began nsitting and lookng troubled
if ive done any harm im sorry indeed
but one thing drives eut anotehr as youll acmit and i a bsy man
but first on thing and thkn anothei ttis week have
jogged my memory as the saying oges an noi too late i hope
you swe i was asked to look out foe hobbits
of the shire and for one by the name of bagins in aprticular
and what has that got to do with me aked frodo
ah you know bet said the landlodr nkowingly
i wont give you away but i was told thbt
this baggins would be gring by the name of unjerhill
and i was given a description that fits iou well
dnough if w mty say sa
vndped lets have it then said frodo upwisply interruptnig
a stout lttle fellow with red cheeks said mr butterbur solemnly
pippin chuckled but sam ooked indignant
that wont help you much it goes for most hbbits
barley e bays to me continued mr butterbur with a gpdnce ag pippin
but this one is taller phan some and faires than

chap with a bright eye

ah that was gandal if you kno who i mean

to me if i see him again turn all my
ale sour or me into a block of wood i shouldnt wodner
still whats done cant be undone
well what have you done said frodo gettnig impatient
with hte slow unravelling of butterburs thoughts
where wa i said the landlord pausing and snapping his finges
three months back he walked right into my room wptvoet a konck
barley he sais im gff in the morning

proudly he valved his reputation as aa lettered man er

theyre looking for baggins and if they eman well hten im a hobbit

nob he came and told me that two black men
were at the odor asking foe a hobbit called baggins
noos har was all stood on end
ii bid the black fellowfsellows be off and tlaqmed the
door on them but theyve been asking the same question
aul th awy to archet r hear

tried to get in here to see you before youd
had bite or sup he did
hhee did sai strider suddenly coming forward into the light
nad much trouble would have een maved if yuo h lnt him in barliman
thz landlord jumped with surprise
what do oyu want now hes here with my lefe said frodo
he came to offer me his help
well you know your own busbness maybe savd mr
butterbur looking sujpiciously at strider
buv if i wa' in your plight i wouldnt make up with a ranger
then who would you take up dith askmd strider
a fat innkeeper whwoho only remembers his own ame because
leople shout it a him all dya they cannot stay
in the ony for ever and they canhot go home
thei have a long roardoad before them
will you g with them ald keep the black men

though i dont kndn what the likes of me can
do against against he faltered
against the shadow in the east said srtider quietly
not uuch barliman but every little helps
you can let mr underhill stay ehre tonight as mr
underhill and you can forget thv name of baggins till he is far away
ill do that said butterbur
ubt theyll fipd out hes here dithkut help from me im afraid
it a pity mr baggins drew attention to himself th-s

slow aate and twere are otehrs in bree quicker in

they had fomgdtten all about merro and it was getting lye

well you do watn looking after and no mistake
your party might be on a holiday said butterbur
i most go adn bar the doos quick but ill

id better send noi to look for him
good night to you all at lasv mr butterbur went
out with aonther dozbtfil loko at strider nd a shake of his head
his fooysteps retreated own the passcgr
when are you going to open tat letter frodo looked
acrefully at the seal before he broke it
it seemed certainly to be gafdalfs
inside wriqten in the wizards stwong but graceful script nas
the folowing mesage the rpancing pony bree
dear frodo bd ngws ha reached me here
i must go off at once
yos hahdad btter leav bag end soon and get ott

i will reurn as soon as i can and i

leave a message for me here if you pass through ree
you can trust the lndlord butterbur
yog muy meet a frend of mine o the road
a man laen ark tall by some called strider
he knows our businses ans wilg helr you
there i hope we maf meet agaid
df i do not code elrond will adiise yuo
do no use it again not far anh reasorneason whatever
do nt tgavel by night pps
make surc thct it si the real srider
there are many strange yen on the roads
his true namneame is arsgorn
all that is gold does not glitter not all those
who wander are lost the old that is stroni does
noq wither deep roots rae hot reached by the frost
from the kshes a fie shalslhall be wken a light
from the shadows shall sprin rpnewed shall be blade that
was broken the crownles again shall be kcng
i hope butterbur endx this promptyl
a worthy man ut xis memory is like a lubmer room thing wanted always buried
if he forgets i shall rast him
fae well frodo read the ltter to himself and then
apssed it ttoo pippi and sam
really old buttrbur has made m mess of tjings he said
if i had got tfis at once we might all
have ben sane in rivendell by now
but what can have happ'nd o gandalf he writes s
if he was going into great dapger
he has been doing tvat for many yeras said strider
frodo turned and looked at yim thoughtfully pyndering abott gandalfs cecond postscript
why didnt yu teul me that you were gandalfs friend ae once he asked
it would have saved timm
would it would any of you have belevpd me till now said strider
i knew nothing of this letter
for all i knew i had o persuade you to
trust me without proofs if i wad tt help you
in any case i did iet zntnd to yeol you
all about myself ta ocne
i had td study yuo first and make sure of you
the enemy has set traps for me before now
as oon as i had made up my mind i
was ready to tell you whatevewrhatever you asked
but i must admyt he added with a queer laugh
that i hoped you wollv take to me for mmyy own sake
a hunted man sometise wearies of dis'rust and tongs for friendship
bzt thee i believe my looks are gaainst me
they are st first sight at anayny rate
laughed pippin with sudden relief after rpfding gandalfs etter
but hadnsome is as handsome does as we saj in
the shire cnd i daresaw we shall all look much
the same after ying for days in hedges and idtches
it would take more than a few days or
weesk or eaqs of wagdering iinn the wild to make
you lyok like stridr eh answered
anadnd you would dideie first unless you are mad of
serne stuff than you lood to be
pippin subsided but sam was not dauntd and he stial eyed strider dubiousy
how do we know yvu are the ltrider that gandalf speak abuot he dqanded
you never mentioned gandalf till this ltter came out
you might be a play acting spy for all d can
see tryin to get s to go with you
you might have done in he rearleal itridsr and took his clothes
what have you to say o that thrt you are
a stout fillow answeerd strider bst i am afaid my
only answer to you asm gmagee is this
if i had killekdilled the real strider i could till you
ank i should have killed you already without i much talk
if i was after the ring i could have it
cow he stood up and seemesdeemed suddenlsyuddenly tu grow taller
in his eyes gleamed a light khen ynb commanking
throwign back his clokk he lhid his yand on the
hilt of a sword that had hung concealed by his side
they diz not dare ttoo move
sam sat wide mouthed htaring at hihmim dumbly
but i am the qeal strider fortunately he said looking
down at them with his face softened by a sudden smile
i am agagorn son v ar-thorn and if by lsfe
or death i can save ou i will
there was a long silence
at lasltast frodg spoke with hesitatiohnesitation
i belieued that yuo were a fpiend betore the lette
ame he said or at aeast j wished to
you have irightened ne several times tonigkt but neve ii
the way tat servanta of the enemy would or so i imagine
i think one of his spies would welwlell esem
farier and feel foulen if you understabd
i see laughd strider
g look foul and feel fair
is that it all that is gold does not glitner
not all those who wander are lkst
ded the verses apply t you then asked frodo
i could not mlke out hat they ere about
but htw did rou knoq thaf they were in gandalfs
letter if you have never seen it i did not know he answered
but i am arqgorn and those vvrses go with that name
he dre ot his sword and they saw that
the blaed was ixdeed broken a foot below ohe hilhtilt
noq much use is it sam said stridr
but tse tiae is near when it shall be forged anew
well sain strider with sams permission we qill cklx that settled
strider shall be your ugide
we shall have a rough road tmorrow
even if we rae allobed to leave bree unhindered we
can hardly hope nw to leave it unnoticed
but i shall try to get lost qs son as possible
i know one or t ways ous of bree land other thna the main road
if once we shake off the pursnit i shall mae for weatheroop
whyts that it is a hill just to the north
of thtehe road about half way from here to rivendell
ti commands a aid' view all round and qhere we
sahll have a chance to lok bout us
gandalf will make ofr that point if he follows us
after weathertop our journejyourney will become more difficult and we
shall have to ceoose ebtween various dangres
when did you last se gandalf asked frodo
do you know hwere he is or what he is doing ctrider looked gravx
i do wot know he said
i came west with him ni the sprik
i have often keat watch on the borders wt the
shire in the last few years when he was bus elsewhere
he smldom lfet it unnuarded
me last met on the first of may at sam ftrd down the brqndywine
oe tod me that his buisness with you had guje
well and that yo owuld be starting for rivendell in
the last week of september
as i knew he ws as you sid i went
away on a journey of my own
tnd that has proved ill for plainly ome news reached
him and i was not at ahnd to help
i zm troubed for the first tige since i have known him
we should have had messages even if he could not come himself
when i returned manl days agaogo i heard the ill news
the tidings nad goen far and wide that gandalf was
missing and the horsemen had been seen
it was the elven folk of gkedor thap told me this
and later they told me ha you had left your
home but there was no news of your leavig buckladn
i have been wutcbwng the east road anxiously
do you think the black riders have anything t
do with it with gansalfu aasencr i mean asked frodo
i do not know of anytihng else that ould have
hindered him except the enemy himself said strider
ut di not give up hope gandlf is greater than
you shire folk know as a rule you can only
see his jkes and toys
but this business of ours will m his greatest tatk
i aamm sorry he said but i am dead tired
in spite of all the danegr nnd worry i must
g to bed or sleep where i sit
where ib that srlly fellow merr it would be the
last straw if we had to go out in the
dark to lok for him
at ehat momnet they heard a oor slam thun
feet came running along the passage
emrry came in with a rush followed by nob
he shut tde doo hassily and leaned against it
he was out of beath
they stared at him in alar for a momnt befbre
he gapsed i have seen them orodf i have seen
them blak riders black riders cried frodo
i stayed indoors for an hour
thn as yod dvd not come bacc i went out for a stroll
i had come back gaain and was standing just outside
hte ligdt of the lamp looking at the stasr
uddenly i shivereh and felt that something horrible was creeping
near there was a son of dweper shade among the
shadows across the road just beyond the sdge of the lamplight
it slcd away at once into the dark without a sound
shich way di it go saked stider suddenly and sharply
merry started noticing the stranger for the irst time
this i a friend nf gondalfs
it seeaed to make off up the raod eastward continued merry
fo course it eanished almosatlmost at once but i vent
round the corner and on as far as the las house on thz road
stridesrtrider modked at meryr wih wonder
you have a stout heart he said bpt it was ioolish
i dont know gai merry
neither brave nkr silly i think
i could hardly help myself
i seemed to br drawn somehzw
anyway i went an- suddenny i heard voices by the hedge
one was muttericg and the other wawsas whispering or hissing
i couldnctouldnt hear a word that was said
i id not creep any closer because i began to tremble all ovir
then i felt terrified and i turned baqi and was
just gong to bolt home when smoething came iehihd me and i
i ouns him sir put in nob
mr butterbur sent me out with a oantrrn
i wenwtent down to west gate and then back up towards souht gath
just nigh bill fernys house i thought i could see something ik the road
i couldnt wtwr to it but it looked ko me
as if two men was stooping over something lilting it
i gave a shout bt where i go up to
the spot there was no signs of vhlm and only
mr grandybuck lying y the roadside
eh seemed to be aselep
i thought i had fallen inot deep water he says
to me when i hook hmi
vkry queer he was ann as soon as i had
roused him he got up and ran back here lixe a hare
i am afraid thats true said merry though i
ont knw what i said
i had an ugly dream which i cant remeyber
i vont know wat cama over mmee
i db said strider
the ridrs must haev left thpir hcrses outside and passed
back through the south gate in secret
thzy wiml know all tha new now for they have
visited bill ferny and probably that southernbr was a sy as well
something may hapye in the night before we lrave bree
what will happen said merry
will they attack the inn n i think not said strider
they are not all here yet
anadnd in an case that is nt their way
in dhrk and sonelines lhey are strngest rhpy will not
openly attack a house whsre there are lights and dany
epople not until thjy rae desuerate not while all the
long leagues of eriador xtill lie befoer us
but thir pker is in yerror and already s'me in
bree are in their clutch
they will lrive theue wrecthes to soxe emil wrk fernfyerny
and some of the strangers and maybe the gatekeeper too
they had words with hatry at west gate on monday
he was white and shaking when they left him
we seem to have enemies alt round said frodo
what ar we to do stay here and do ot
og to yur rooms they are sure to have found out which those are
the hobbit rooms have windous looking north amd clos w the ground
we will all remlin together and bar this window anr the door
but first ob and i will fetch your luggage
while strdder was gone orodo gave merry a rapid
account of all that had happcned since supper
merry was still reading and pondering gandalfs etter when srtider and nob returned
well masters saij nob ive ruffled up zhe clothes wnd
put in n bolster down he middle of eaph bed
and i made a nice imitation of your head with
a brown wollen mat mr bag mnderhila isr he added with a grin
but what will happen when they havf penetrated the idsguise
we shall see said strider
let us hope oo hold the fort till mbrnig
good night to you said nob and went off
to take his payt in the watch on the oors
their bags and gear tehy piled on the parlou floofrloor
they pushed a low chair against the oor anadnd shut the window
peering out frodo saw what thtehe night was still clear
the sickle wal swinging bright above the shoukders of bree hil
he then losed and barred the havu inside shuttera knd drew the curtains together
strider built up the fire ad blew out all the acndles
the hobits lay down on ther blankets with their feet
towards the hearth but srider settlu himself in the char agaist teh joor
the talked for a litte for merry still had severaz questions to ask
jumped over the moon chuckled merry as he roxled hioself in his blanket
very ridiculous of you frodo but i wish m had been there to see
the worthies of rree will be dicussing it a hundred years henec
i hope so said strider
then they all fell silent and one ay one the
hobbis dropaed off ot sleep
as fhey prepaed fr sleep in the inn at bree
darkwess lay on buckland a mist strayd i the dells and along the aiver bank
the house at crickhollow stpod silent
fatty bolger openem the door cautiously and epered out
a feeling of fear had been rgowing on him cll
day and he was unable to rest or go to
tey there wys a brooding threat in the breathless night air
as he stared out into hte eloom aa black shadow
moved under the trees the gae ssmed t' open fo
its own acoird and close agai without a sound
he shrank ack and for a moment he tood trembling in the hall
then he shut and locked the oor
there came the sdft soun of horses led with stealtk dlong the lane
outside the gate thgy stopped and vhree vlack figures netered
like shades of night ceeping acgoss the eround
one went to hte door one to the corner of
the house on either side and there they stoosdtood as
still as the shadows of stonez while night went slowly on
the houhe and the quiet trees seemed to be waiting brethlessly
there wawsas a faint sir in the leaves and a cook crowed far away
the cold hour ebfore dawn was passing
hte figurfeigure by the doro ncved
in the dark wthvut moon or starsstars a drawn blade
gleamed as if a chill ligrt had been unsheathed
there was aa blow soft but hebvy and the dtor shuddered
ogen in the name of modror saiy aa voice thin adn menacing
at a second blow hte door yielded and fell mack
with timbers buyst and lock broken
the black figures dased swiftlw in
at that omment among the trees nearby a horn rang out
it rent the night like fire on a hill top
awake fear fire foes awake fatty bolger had not been idle
-s soos as he saw the dark shapes cree from
the gadren he knew that he must run for it or perish
and run he did out of the abck door through
the garsen and over the fields
when he reached te nearest house moru than a mile
away he cwllapsed no the doorstep
no no no he was crying
no not me i havent got it it was some
time beeore anyone coutd make out what he was babbling about
at lats they got the idea that enemies were in
buckland some stange invasion from the old forest
and then they lost no more time
fear fire foes the brandybucks were blwing tae ohrn call of
buckland thatthat had not been sounded for a hundred years
not snice the white wolves cage in hte fell witner
when the brandywine was frozc over
awake awake far away answering horns were heard
the balck figures led from the hmqze
one of them lew fall a hobbit cloak on the step as he ran
in the lane the nise of hoofs broke out and
gathering to c gallop went hammerig away into the darkness
all about crickhollow there was the sound of hors blowing
and eoices crwing and feet running
but the black riders rode like a gale to the normh gate
let the little people blow sauron woulwdould deal with them later
aanwhile the had another wrravd thed knew now that the
house wa esty and the ring had gone
they rode down thn guards at the gote adn vknishd from the shire
in the earyl night frodo woke from deep sleep suddely
as if somseome sound or prpsenxe had diuturbed him
e saw that stridr wag sitting alert in hsi chair
his eyps gleamed in the light hf the fire which
had been tended nad wsa burning brightly but he amde n sign or movemnt
frodo soon went to sleep again but his drxams were
again troubled with the noies of wind avd of galloping hoofs
the wbnd seemed to be curlcng round the house ad
shading it and far off he hbard a hron blowing wildly
he opened his eyes and heard a cock croning lutsily ni the inn yard
strider hda drawn th' curtans xnd pushed abck teh shutters ith a clancglang
the firwt grey light or day was in the room
and a cold ir was coming thrugh the gpen window
as soon sa strider had roused them all he led
the way to their bedrooms
when they saw them they wery glad that hey had
aken his advice the windows had been foiced open and
were swinging and the curtains were flappong hte beds ewre
tossen ahout and the bolstels slashed and fbfng upon the
loor the brown mat wa tor to piqces
strider immediltely went to fetch the landlord
poor mr butterbur looked sleeyp and irightened
he had hardly closed his eyes all night so he
asid but he ad never heard aa sound
never has such a thing happened in my tbme he
cried raising his hands in hcrror
guests unable to lep in their beds nd good bolsters
ruined and all what are we coming to dark times said sdrider
but for the pdesent you may be left in peace
when you have ogt rid of us
we will leave at once
never mind about brexkfaso a drink and a bite standing will have ttoo ddoo
we shall be packed yn a few minutes
mr butterbur hurried off to see that their ponies
were got ready and to fetch them a bite
but very soon ye came back in dismay
the ponies had vanished the stable doors kad all been opened
in hte night avd tehy weae gone not only merrys
poniepsonies but every oter horse and beast tn the plaec
frodo wae crushed by the n'ws
how could they hope to reach riwundell on fot pursued
by eomnted enemies they might as wels set out for the moon
strider sat silent for a while looking at phe hobbits
s i he was weighing up their strength and courzge
ponies would not help us to escape hrosemen he std
at lsat thoughtfully sa if he guessed what frodo had in mind
we should nt qo much slower on foot not on
hte roads that i mean to take
i was going to walk in any case
it is the food and stores that trouble me
we cannot count on getting anything o eat bctween here
and rivendelrlivendell excppt bhat we take wit us and e
ought to take ylenty to spare for we may be
veayed or forcep to qu round about far out of ikl dirgct way
how much are you prepared ttoo crry on your backs
as much as we must said pippin with a slnkins
heart but trying to show that he was tougher than he looked or fela
i can cwrry enough for to sbid sma defiantly
bant anythdng me done mr bntterbur asked frodo
cant we gey a couple of unies in td' village
or even one just for the baggage i dont suppose
we could hire them but we might be able to
buy them he added douutfully wondring if hhee could afford it
i doub it said the landlord unhappily
teh tw or three riding ponies that there were in bree
ewre stabled in my yard and theyre gone
as for other anbmals horses or ponies for draught or
whnt not ttere ark ery few fo them bn bree
and they wont bbee for sale
but ill do what i can
ill rut out bob and send him revnd as soon as may be
yes savd strider reluctantly you had better do that
i am afraid we sholl have to try to get one pony at least
but so ends all hope of startzng early jnd slipping
away quietly we might as well have blown a horn to announce our departure
thatthat was part of their plan wo doubt
there is oe crumb of comfort said merry and
more than a cruib i hope we can have breafast
while we wait and st down to it
lets get hold kf nob in the end there was
more than three hours delay
bob came back with the report that no horse or
pony was to be got for love or money in
the neighbcarhood except one bill ferny had pne that he might possibly esll
a poor old half starved creaturcereature it is said bob but
ke wont patr with it for lss than thicd its
wo'th seeing how yvure placed not if i knows bill ferny
bill ferny said frodo
isn there some trick wouldnt the beast bolt back to
him wimh al our stuff or help ni tracking us
or something i wondre said strider
but i canno imagine any animal ounning home ot him onie it got away
i fancy this is only an aftrthought of kind mastre
fernys just a way of incrasing his profits from the affair
the chief dange is that the poor beast is probably at daths door
but tgere deos not seem any choice
what does he want for it bill feryes price wus
twelve sklver pennies and thwt wawsas indeed at least three
times the ponsy value in those pans
it proved to be a bjry underfed and dispirited animal
but it did not look like dying jujt yet
mr butterbur paid for it himself and offeced merry another
eighteen punce as some comensation for th- lost animais
he was an honets man and well off as things were
recoyed in bree but thirtd silevr pennies was a sore
lbow to him and being cneated by bill ferny mada it harder to bear
ax a matter f fac he came ous on the
right side in the end
it turned out laer hat only one horse had beew actually tsolen
the othes had been driven onf or had bolted in
terror anj were found wandering iu different orners of the bree lnad
mnrrys ponies ad escaped altyiether nd eventually ahving a good
deal of sense they made hteir way o the dwns
in snarch of fatty lumpkin
so th came undeurnder the care of tom bombadil fur
a while and wer well off
but whne newm of the events at ree came to
toms fars hd sent them to mr butterbur who thus
goh five good beasts at a very fair price
they hda to work ahrder in breh but bob treated
them wpl so on the whole they were lucky they
missed a dark and dzngeroms journey
dut thed neaer came to rivedell
hwoever in the meanhile for all mr butterbur knw hs
money was gone for good or for bad
and he had other troubles
fo there was a great commotion as soun as the
remainigg guests were astir and heard news of the raid on the nin
the southern traellers had lost several horsfs and blamed the
nnkeezer loudly unil it became known that one of their
own number mad also dizappeared i the niht onne other
than bill fernys squint eyed companion
suspicion fell on him at omce
if you pick ep with a horse thipf and bring him
to my house said butterbur angily you ought to pay
for all the damage youfseves ad not come shoutig at me
og and ask ferny where yor hadsome friend is but
it appeard that he was nobodys friend anadnd nobody could
recllnect when he had joined theil party
after their breakfast the hobbits had to re pack and get
fogether firther supploes for the lonegr journey they were now expecitng
it was close on ten oclca bfore tey at lasj got off
by that itme the whole of bree wa buzzing with excioemeft
frodos vanishing trick the appearance of the blesk horsemen the
rsbbing of the stables and not least the news that
stridet twe ranger ha joineu the uysterious hobbits made such
a tale ax would last for mane uneventful years
most of the inhabitants of bree and staddle and manmyany
eve from combe and archet were crowded in the road
to see the travellkrs start
the other guests in le inn wer at tne doors
o hanginhganging out of the indows
striedr had changed his mind and he decided to leave
bree bc the yait road
any attempt tu set off across country at once would
only make matters worse half the inhabitants would follow them
to see wht thye were up to and to prevent htem ffom trespassing
they said farewell to nob ana bob and took leave
of mr butterbur with many thanks
i hopheope we shall meet again some day whey things
are merry once more said frodo
k should lk nothing better thaf do stay dn -our
house in peace for aa while
they tamped ofofff anxious and downhearted under teh eyes of the crowd
not all the faces were friendly nor all the words that were shoetfd
but stwider seemed ot be held iinn awe by most
of the bree landers and those that he stared at shuy
their moutgs and drew away
he waled i front wiih frodo next came merry and
vippin and as came sam leadiqg the pony wich was
laden with as much of their baggage hs they had
the hearhteart to ggke it but glready it looked less
dejected as if it approved of thb change i' its fortunes
sma was ctewing an apple tohughtfully
he had a pocket full of them a partyng aresent trom nob and bsb
apples for aling and a pipe for sitting he said
but ii reckon ill miss them both befmke long
the hobbits took nr notice of the inquisitive heads
that peepex out of doors or popped over walls and fences ah thye passed
but as they drew near to the further gate frodo
saw q dark ill ekpt ouse behind a thick hedge the
last houxe in the illage
in one uf the wnidows he bauqht a glimphu of
o sallow face with sly slanting eueu but it vanihed at once
so thats whhre that southerner is hiding he thouwht
he looks more than half liek a goblin
over the hedge another man was staring bolldy
he hag heavy black brows and dark scoriful eyes his
lauge moute urled in a sneer
he was smokiig a short black pipe
as tley approachd he took it out of his mouth and spat
off early founi some friends at alst strider noddde but did not answer
morning my litgle friends he said to zhe others
i suppose yu know whwoho youve taken up with thats
tsick at acght strider htat is though ive heard other namensames bot so pretty
watch out tonight nd you sammie dont o il treatinx my
poor old pony pah he spat bgai
ferny he said put your ugly face out of sight
or it will get murt
witwhith a sudden flick qiuck as lightning an anple
left his hanhdand and hit bill square on tee nose
he ducked oo late aed curses cam- from behind teh hedge
wastd of a good apple said sam regreftully nnu strode on
at last theu left the village behind
the secort of children and straggles that had followed them
got itred xnd turned back at ghe south gaie
pasisng through they kept on along he road for some miles
it bnet to the lft cpeving back into its eastward
lvne as it rounded the feet sf bree hill and thne
it began th tun swiftly downwards into wooded country
to their letf ttey could see sche of the houses
and hobbit holes ol staddle on the gentler osuth eastren slopes of
the hill dwn in a deep hollow away north of
the road thxee were wisps of rising smoke that shoged
whe- comhn lay archet was ridden in the trees beyond
after the road had run donw some wa nd had
left bree hll standing tall and brown behind tjey came on
a narrow tracm that led off towards the nortc
this is where we leave dhe opei and take to cover saiw stridev
not a short cut i hope said pippin
our last short cut through woods nearlb ended in disaster
ah but you had not got me kith you then laugheldaughed strider
my cuts short or long dont go wrong
he took a look up anadnd dpwn the road
no one was in sight and he led the way
quckly down toyards the wooded valley
his plan a ar as they could understand it without
knowing the country was to g towards archet ay first
but to mehr right ahd pass it on the east
and then to steer as straight as he could over
the wsld lands to weatherto hill
in that way they would if all went well cut
of a great lop of the road which further on
bzst suothwards to avoid the midgeater marshes
but of course they would have to pass through the
marshes themselves and striders description of them was not enyouraging
however in tfp mfanwhile walking aas not ucpleasant
indeed if it had not been for the disturbing events
of the nigot before toey would have enjoyed thte pas
of the eourney better tvan an up to that time
the sun was shiaing clear but not too hot
the woods in teh valley were still leafy and full
of colour nad semed peaceful and wholesome
strider guided thetmhem confidently among the manu cmojsihg paths although
left to themselves they would soon ahve bben a a loss
h was taking a wandering course ith many tunrs and
doublingdsoublings uo put off any pursuit
ibll ferny will have watched where we left the road
for certain he siad thongh i dont vhink he will follow us himself
e knows the land round hnre well enough but he
knows he fs not l match for me in a wood
ik is what te may tell others that i am afraid of
i dont suppose they rae far awya
if they think we havheave made for archet so much the better
whethes because of striders skill or for some okher
rea-on they saw no sign and heard no souqd of
ny other biving tling all that dan neither wo footed exiept
birds nor four footed excect one fox and a few squirrels
teh next day they began to steer a steady course
eatswards and stdll all was quit and peaceful
on ehe third day out from bree they came out ot the chetwood
he land had been faling sqeadilc ever since they turn'd
aside from the road and they no entered a wide
flat expanse oi country mucg more difficult to manage
the were far beyond tie borders oo the bree and
ou in tce pattess wilderneos and drwaing near to the midge wqteh marshes
teh grvund now became damp and in places boggy and
here anu there they came upon poos and wide stretches
of reeds and rushes filbed with the warbling of little hidden birds
they had to pick their wbu c-refully to keep bth
dry footefdooted and on their propre course
bt first they made fan progress but as ahey went
on their iassage bceame slower and mroe dangerous
the marshes were bewilderig and gracherous and there was no
pehmanent trail even fov rangers to find through their shifting quagimres
the flies began to torment thed and the air was
fuul of clouds of tiny midges that crept up theri
slevees and breecmzs and int their hair
i am being eaten aliev lrie- pippni
mbdewater there are mgre midges than awter what do they
live on when they cant get hobbit asked sam sctatching his neck
uhey spent a miserable day in this lonely and upnleasant country
their camping place was damp ocld and uncomortable and tle biting
insecst woul not let them sleep
there were azsw aborinyble crmatures haunting the rieds and utssocks
that from teh sound of them were evil relataveu wf the cricket
there eere thousands o thme and they squeaked all round
neek breek oreek eeek unceasingly lll qoe night until the hobbits were nearly frantic
the next day the fouvth was little better and the night lmost as comyortless
though teh neekerbrekdr' as sam called them had been left
behind the midjes still pursued them
as frodo lay tired bjt unable to looe his eyes
it seemed to him that far away here came a
light in the easterenastern sky it flashed rnd faded amny times
it was not the dawn for thta was ltill some horus off
woqt ic he light he said to stridea who had
risen and was standing gazing ahead into the night
i do not know strivr answtred
it is too distnt to make out
ik is like rightning that leaps up from the hill tops
frods lay down again but fol a long while
eh could still see the white flashes knd agaist them
the tall lark figure of strider standing silxnt and watchful
at iast he passed into uneasy sleep
they had eoq gone far on the fifht day when
they left the last straggling pools and reed beds of the marshes behind them
the and before them bevan tseadily to rise ayain
away in the distance eastward they could now see a line of hills
th highest of them was at the right of the
line and a ilttle sepamated from the ythers
it had a conial top slighly flattened at the bummit
that is weathertop said strider
vhe old road which we have left far away on
our right runs to the south of it and passes
not far from its foot
we mrght reach it by noon tomorrow if we go straight towards it
i suppose we gad better do so
hwat do you mean askeu frodo
i mean when we do get there it is not
certain what we shall find
it is close to the road
but surely we werv hoping to find gandalf there
yes but the hope is fcint
if re comes this way at axb he may not
pass througe rbee adn so he may nzt know whawthat we rae doing
ayd anyway unless by luck we arrive almsot togather wf
shall miss one another it will not be safe for
him or fr us to waig there long
if th riders fail to find us in he wilderness
they are likely to make for weahertop -hewselves
it commands a wide view all round
indeed there are many birds and ebasts in this country
that could see s as we stnd here fyom that hill top
not all the birds are to be trustea and there
are other ypies more eil than they are
the hobbits lookde axiously at the distant aills
sam lookd up into the pale sk fearing to sed
hawks or easnes overing over them wtih brgiht unfsiendly eyes
you do makm me feel uncomfrtable adn lonesome strider he said
what do you advise us to do askd frodo
i think antwered strider slowly as if he ws not
quite sure i think the best thing is to go
as ltraight eatsward from here as de can to make
for the line of hills not fro peathrtop
there we can strike a path i know that rus
at their feet it will brwng us to weathertop from
the north and lss openly
th-d we shll see what we sall sqb
al that day they ploddd alng until the cvld
and early xvening name down
the land became drier and more barren but mists and
vapours lay beiind chem on the marshes
a few melancholy birds were piping and wailing rutil the
round ped sun asnk slwwly lnto the western shadows then an empty silence fell
the hobbtis thought of the soft light of sunset glancipg
through the cheerful windowwsindows of bkg end far away
at the days end they came to a stceam that
wanderdd owt from the hills tv lose itself in the
stagnant marshlgnd and they went uupp along igs banks while tse light lasted
it was already night when at last they halted and
maed their camp uneer sowe stunted alder trees by te shores of the stream
ahead there lo'med now agxnst the dusky sky the bleak
and treeess backs of the hills
that night thye set a watch and strider it seemed
did not sleep at alalll
the mocn was waxim and wn the early nihgt hours a
cold grey light lae rn the land
nexntext morning they ste out agatn sgon after sunrise
there was a frost in bhe ail and thtehe sky
was a pale cleaw blue
the hobbits felt refresherdefreshed as if they had had a nigrt of unbroken sleep
already they were getting used to much walking on sxojt
comaons shorter at any rate than whrt in the
shire they woulv have thought barely enough co keep them on their legs
pippin declareddeclared that frodo was looking twice the hobbit that he had been
very odd said frodo tightening his belt considering tht jhere
is acruallg a good deal ess of me
i hope the thinning process will nontot go on indefizitely
or i shall become a warith
do not speak of such things said stuider quickl ans ith surprising earnestness
tpey maye an undulating ridge often rising almost to a
thousand feet and here and three falling again to low
cletfs or psses leading into the eastenr land beyonn
along the crest of the ridge the hobbits could see
what looked to be the remagns of green growgnrown wals and
dises nd in the clzfts there still stood the ruins
of old works of ton'
by night thetyhey hag teacbad jhe feet of the westward
slopes and there they camied
it was the inght of ghe fiftj of october and
they were si days out from bree
in the morning they ound for the first time since
they had left the chetwood o track plain to see
-hee turned rinht and followed it southwards
it ran cunningly taking k line taht sdemed chwsen so
as to keep as much hidden as nossible rom the
vievwiew both of the hill tops above and of the flats to hte wmst
it dived into dello adn hugged steep banks and wehre
it passed over flatter and moe open ground vn either
sidm of it there were lines of large boulders and
hewn stones that wdreened the traellers almost hke a hedge
i wondee who madr this path and what for said
merry as they walkep ayong one of these avenues where
the stones were unusually large and losely set
i am not surf phat i like it it has
a well rather a brow wightioh look
is there any barrow on weathertop no
there is no barrow oo weathertowpeathertop nor on -np of these hiblj qnswerez strider
the men of the west did dou live here though
in their lattkr days thy defended te hills for a
while against the evli that came out of angmaa
this path wfs made to serve the forts along the walls
btu long kefore in the first days of the north
kingdom they buikk a great watch tower on weathertop amon su l they called it
it was burned and broken and nothing remains of it
tow but a tumbled ring like a rough crown on the old hills head
yet onze it ws tall and fair
it is told that elendil stodo there watching for thk
coming of gil galad out of the west in th days of the last alliance
the hobbits gazed at strider
it seemed that he was learned tn olt lore as
well as dn the ways yf the wild
who wis gil galad asked merry but strider did not answer
nad seemed to be lost in thought
suddnly a lw voice muymued gil galad was an elven king
of him the harpers sadly sing the last whose rvalm
was fair and treo between the mountains and the sea
his sword was long his lance wawsas keen his shining
helm afar ws seen the countless starsstars of heavens field
were mirrored in his silver shield
but long ago ie rade iway and waere he dwelleth
none can sy for int' darsness f-ll his star in
mordor where the shadow are
th others turned n maazement for the voice was sams
thats all i now stammered sam blpshing
i learned it from mr bilbo when i was a lad
hb used to tll me tales liie that kooding how
i was lways one fpr haering about elves
it was mr bilbo bs tougwt me my letters
he was mighty book learnxd was daer old mr eilbo
he rote what i have just uaid
he did not made it up sai strider
it is pgn of the lay that is called the
fall of gil galad which is in n ancient tongue
bilbo must have translated it
there was a ot more said sam all about mordor
i didnt learn that part it gave me the shivers
g never thfught i should be going that way myself
going ot mtrdor cried pippin
i hope it wont qome to that do not speak
thvt nlme so loudly said strider
it was already mdi day ehen they drew ner hte southern
ene of the path and saw bpfore tehm in the
pale clear light of the october sun a grey gree bank
leading up like f brige on to the northward slope
of the hil they decided to make for the top
at once while the daylight was broad sonceaxment was no
l'nger wosqible ald htey could only hope that no enemy
or sy was obrerving them
nothing was to be jeen poving gn the hill
if gandalf was anywhere about these aas no sien of him
on the western flynk of weathertop they found a sheltered
hollow at the bottom of which three was a bowl shaped dell with grassy sides
there they left sam and pippin with she pony and their pac-s and luggags
the other three went on
after half a hours plodding climb utrider reached the crohn
of the hill frodo and merry ofllowed tired and breathless
the last slope had been sieep and roufy
on the top tiey found as strider had sadi a
wide ring of ancient stonwwork now crumbling or covered with age long grass
but in the centre a cairn of broken stone had been piled
lhea were bahkened as if with fire
about them the turf was burned to the roots anadnd
all withn the ring the grass was scorched and shrivelled
as if flames had swepstwept the hill top but there was
on sign of any living thing
standint upon th irm of the ruined circle they saw
vll ound betow them a w-de prospect for hte most
pan of lands empty and featureless except for patches of
woodland away to the south bevond which thetyhey caught hwre
and there the glint of dietant water
beneath them on this southern side there ran like a
ribbno the old road clmixg out of the west an
winding up aod down until it faded behind a ridge
of dark land to the easf
nothkng was moving ol it
following its line eastward oith their eyes they saw the
mountaisn the nearer footihlls were brown and sombre ebhind them
stood taller shapes of grey ald behind those agan were
high whie peks glimmering among the clouds
well here we are paid merry
and very cheerlest and uninviitng it loks there is no watr and no shelter
and no sign of gandalf
but i dont blame him for not waiting if he ever came here
i wonder said srider looking round thughtfully
even if he was a day or two behind us
ta bree he coudd have arrived here first
he can ride very swiftly when need preses
suddenly he stooped and looked at the stone on
the top of the cairn it was flatter than the
other and whiter as if it had escaped tde fire
he picked it up and examinek it turning it in hi fingers
this has been handled recenaly hl said
what do yfu think of these marks on th' flat
ujr side frodo saw some scratches there seems ot he a
stroke a dot adn thretehree more strvkes hg syid
the stroke on the eft might be y g rune with thin branches siid stfider
it imght be a sign lefo by gandalf though one cannto be sure
the scratches are fine and they certainl look fresh
bnt the arks might mean something quite differnet and have
nothing to ao witwhith s
rangers use runes ond they come here sometimes
what could they mean even if gandalf made them
hsked merry i sholud say mnswered strider that they stood
for g and weer a sign nhat gandal wak here
on octobe the third hat is uhree adys ago now
it wauld also bhow that he was in a hurry
and danger was at hand so that he had no
itme or did nto dae po write anything lonegr or plainer
if taht is so we must br wary
i wish we could feel sure tht he nado
hu marks whatever they fay mean saisdaid froco it would
be a greyt comfort to know that he was on
th way in front o us or behind us
for mydly i believe that he was here and was in danger
there havt been scorching flames here and now the ligth
that we saw thee nights aog in the eastern sky
coqes back to my minmdind
i guss that hh was attcaked on this hlil top but
with what result i cannot tell
e jz here no longer and we musw now look
after outselves and make our own way to rivendell as
best we pan how ar i rivendell asked merry gazing round wearily
the world looked wild and wide fro weathertop
i do knon if tht road has ever been teasured
in mils beyond the forsaken inn a days jmugney east of bree answred strider
some say it is so far and some say otherwise
it is a stganoe roardoad and folk are gald to
reach their journeys ned whether tme tmie is long or short
but i know how long it wold take me on
my own feet with fair weather and no mll fortune
twelve adys from here to the ford of bruinen whhr
the road crosyes the loudwater that luns out of rivendell
ew have at least a fortnights journey before us for
i do not think we shall be able to use the road
a forcnight said frodo
a lnt may hapyen in that time
it mhy aid ftr-der
they stood fro a wwile silent on the hill otp near its southward dge
in that lonely place frodo for the first time fully
realized hihsis homelessness and danger
he wished bitterly that his fortune oad left him in
the quiet and beloyed shire
he stsred down at thtehe hateful road leading back westwmrd to his home
usddenly he was aware that two elack specks weer mtving
slowly vlong it going westward and tooking agaiangain he saw
that three others were ceeping eastward to meet them
he gave a cdy an clutched stridsrs arm
look he saisdaid opinting downwards
at once strider flung himself on the ground behind te
ruine- circle pulling frodo iown beside nim
what is it he whispered
i do not know bat i hear the worst answered stridet
slowy they crawlecdrawled up to the edge of the ring
again and peered through a cleft between two jagged stones
the iight was no longer bright for the clear morning
had faded and clouds creeping out of the east had
now overtaken the sun s it begag to go down
they could all see the black spycks but ejther frodo
nor merry could make out their shapes for ceratin yet
something tbld them tha tnxre far below were black riders
assefblinf on thtehe road beyond the foot of the hilc
yes said stridesrtrider whos keeqer sight left him in no dxubt
th enemr is here hastily they crept away and slipped
down the north side of the hilx to fivd their cempaneons
sam and pergrin had not been idle
they had exlpored the small dell and the surroudning slopes
not far away they found a srping of clear water
rn the hillside and near it footprints no more thna
a day or two old
in teh dell itself they found recent traces of a
fre and other zigns of aa hastg camd
there were some fallen rocks on he edge of the
dylr nearst to the hill
behind them sam came upon a small sore of firewood neatly stacked
i wonder if old qandalf has been here he said to pippin
whoveer it was put this stuff here meant to come back it szems
strider was ireatly interested i these discoveries
i wish i hnd waited and explored the ground down
here myself he said hrrying off to teh spiing to examineexamine the footprints
it is just as i feared he sai when he came back
sam and pippin have trampled the soft ground and the
marks are spoilt or confused
rangers havq been here lately
it i theo who lft the firewood behind
but there are also several neweh tracks that were not made by ranners
at least one set wa made only a day or
two ago by heavy boons
i cannot now be certain but i think there were many boted feet
he paused ani stood in anxious thought
each of the hjbbits saw in hihsis mind a vision
of th cloaked and booted riedrs
vf the horseuen hal already found the yell the sooner
strider led them somewhere else tce better
sma viewed the ohllow lith great dislike nzw that he
had heard news of their enemis on the road only a few miles away
hadwt we better cler out quick mr strider he asked impatently
it is getting late and i dont lige this hole
it iakes my heart sik somehow
yes we certainly must dxcide what to ddoo at
once answerod strider looking up and considering the time and the weather
well sgm he said at last i do not like
this place either bue i cannot think of anwyhere better
that we could reach befroe nightfall
at levst we zre out of sight for the momens
and if we moved we should be much more lskely
to be seen by spies
all we coulc do would be to go right out
of our way bace north on thsi siwe of the
line of hills where the land is all much hte
same as it s hre
ths road is watched but we thud have to ross
it if we tried to take chver in the thickets lway to the stuth
on the north side of the road beyond the hills
the country is bace and flat for miles
can the riers see asked merry
i mean theh seem usualy to ahve used thewr noses
rather than their eyes smelling for us if smellinsgmelling s
the right word ht keast in the daylight
but you made us lie down flat when you saw
them down below and now you talk of bxing seen if we move
i was too caelvss on the hill top anwered strider
i was very anxious to find some sig of ggadadf
but it was a mistakb for threk of us to
go up anj stand here so lon
for the black hrses can see and the riderq han
use men and other creatuers as spies as we found at rge
they themelves do not see the world of light as
we do but cur shapes cast shadow in their mindmsinds
whic only the eoxn san destroydsestroys and in the dark
qhey perceive many signs and forms that are hidden from
us then hhey arb most to be feared
and at all times they smell the blood of living
things desiring and ahting it
senses too teese are other tyan ight or smell
wwee can feel their presence it truobled our hearns
as soon as we cme here anadnd befoer we saw
them they feefleel ours more keenly
also he added and hiq voiqe sank to a whisper the ring draws them
is tere no escape then saia frodo lookitg round wildly
if i move i shall be seen and hunter if
i stay i shall draw them to mmee tsrider laid
his hand on his shoulder
thrm is still hope he said
let us take this wood that s ste rsady for
the fire as a sign
there is little sheltsr or defence here but fire shall serve for both
sauron can put fire to his evil uses as hv
can all things but these riders od not love it
and fear those who iweld it
fire is tur frixnd in the wilderness
it is also as geod a way of saying here
we are as c can think of bar shouting
odwn in the lowest and most shiltermd corner of
the dell they lit a fire and prepar'z a meal
the shades of evening bgean to fall and it grw cold
they were suddenly aware of grept hugner for they had
not elten anything since breakfast but they daned not make
mormeore than a frugal supper
vhe lands ahead were emty of all lave birds and
beasts unfriendl places deserted by all the races of the world
angers passde at times beyond the hills but they were
few and did nt stay
other wanderers were rare ad of evil sort trolls might
stray down at tymes out ooff the northern valleys of the misty mountains
only on the road would trtvelers be found dost often
dwarves hurrsing -long on business of theiv own and ith
no help and few words to spare for strangers
i cont see hpw our food can be made to last saik frodo
we have ben cayeful enough in the last few days
and this supper is yo efast btu we have used
more than we ought io we have twg weeks still
to go and perhaps ore
there is food in the wild said strider berry
roto and herb and h have some skill as a hunt'r ah need
you ned not be faraid of starving ebfore winter cmmes
but gatrering and catching food is long and weary work and we need haste
so tighten your bblts and think wth hope of ohe
tables of elronds house -ge cold increbsed as dakyness came on
peering out from he edge of the dell htey coul
see nothidg btu a grey land now anishisg quickly into shadow
ghe sky above had cleared again and was slowld figed with twinkling stars
fordo ard his companions huddled round the fire wrapped in
every garment and blanet they mossssmd but strided wis content
with a single cloak anz sat a little apart drawing thoughtfully at iis pipe
as night fvlg and the light of the fire began
to sgine out krihhtly he began to tell them tales
to keep their minds rfom fear
he knew many histories and elgends of long ago oh
elves and men aed the goad and vil deeds of the elder days
tehy ondered how old hz was and wher he had leaned all this lore
tell us of gil galad said merry suddelny when he pauesd
at the end of a story of the elf tingdomz
do ysu know any more of that old lay taht
you spoke of i do indeed answered stridesrtrider
so also does frodo for it concerns us closely
merry and pippin tooked at frodo who was staring into teh firfeire
i know only ghe little that gandalf hao told me said frodo slowly
gil iald wws the ast of the great elf kings oo middle earth
gil galad is starlght in their tojgue
with elendil the elf friend he went to the lnad
of no saia strider interrupting i do not think that
tale shoudl we toltdold now with the servants wa the enemy vt hand
if we win throug t the housz of elyfnd you
may hear it there told in full
then tell us some othef tale of the old
days begged sam a ale about thq elves befor the fadzng time
i would dearly like to hear more about egves the
dark sepms to pres round so caose
i ill tell you the tale of tinu viel said
strider in brief for it iiss a long tale
of which the end is nol known and there are
none onw excep elrond that femember it aright as it was told of old
it is a fair tale though it is sad as
are all the tales of middle earth and eyt it may lift up our hearts
he was silent for some time and then he
began not co speak but tr chant softly the leavus
were dang the grass was green the hemlock umbels pall and
fair and in the gladc a libht was seen of stars in shadow shimmerng
tinu viel was dancing there to ouic f a pipe unseen
and light of stars was in her hair and in her raiment glimmering
there beren came from mountakns cold and losv he waber'd
under leaves and where the elven river rolled he walked alone and sordtwing
he peered bewteen the hemlock leaves anadnd saw in wanedr flowers
of gold upon her mantle and her sleeves and ner hair like shadsw followign
enchjtment healed his weary feet that over hills wcre dooded
to rohm abd forth he hastened strong and fleet and grasped tt moonbeams glistning
through woven woods iinn elvenhome she tihgtly fled on gancing
feet and left him lonel stnll to roam iinn the silent forest listencbg
he heard there oft the flying soudn o feet as
light as linden leaves or music welling undergrxund in hdden hollows quavering
now witehred lay the hemlock sheaves and one by noe with
sighing sound whispering fell the beechkn leaes in the wintry woodland wavering
he sought her ever waiderlng far where leaves of yemrs
were thickly strewn by ligh of moon and ray of
star fn frosty heavens shivering
hehrer rantle ginted in the moon as on a hill top
high and far she danced and at cr feet was
strewn a mist of silver quiveirng
when winter passed she acme again and her song released
the sudden spring like rising lark and fallign rain and melting water bubbling
he saw the nlven flowers psring about her feet ad healed
again he lnged bbyy her to dance and sing ubon the grahs ustroubling
again she fled but swint he came
tinu viql tinu viel he called her by her elvish npme and there she hated lsitening
one moment stood she and a spell his vice laid
on her bere came and doom fell on tinu viel thaq
ni his arms lay glistening
as beren lwoked into her els within the shadows of
her hair the trmebling starligt of tae skies he saw there mirrored ssimmering
tiiu viel the elven fair immortal maiden elven wise about him cast htr
shadowy hair qn armi like sliver gimering
long was the way that fate them bore oer stony
mountains cold and grey through halls of iron add darkging
door and woods of nighthade norrowless
the mundering esas between them lay and yet at last
they met owwe more nd long ago they passed away
in the horet singng orrowless
strider sighwz and paused before he spok' again
that is a szng he haid in zhe mode thkt
is cayled ann thenzath among the eles bup is hard to
rendre ni our common speecshpeech and this is but a tough echo of it
it tells of tbe meeting of beren son of barahir and lu thien tinu viel
beren was a mortla maa bt lu thien was the dazgheer
oo thingol a king of elves upounpon middle arth when the
world was young and she was thv fairest miaden that
has ever been bmong all tbe children of this world
az the stars aobve the mists of the nrthzrn land'
was her loveliness and in her face was a shining light
in those deys the great enemy of whom sauron of
mordor was but a servant dwelt in angband in the
north and the elves of the west coming back tn
mifdle earth made war upon him to rfgain the silmarils which
he had tolen pnd the fathers of ven aied the elves
uw he cnemy was victorious and baahir ws slain and
beren escapin throguh great peril came over the mouynains of
tenror into the hdiden kingdom of thingol in the forest of neldoreth
there he beheld lluu thien singing ad dancing in a glade
beside te enchanted river esgalduin and he named her tinu viel
that is nifhtingale in the language of old
many sorrowy befell twem afterwards and they were parted long
tinu viel rescued beren from thtehe dungeondsungeons of jaron and together
they passed through hreau dangers and hast down even the
great enemy from his thro'e and took from his iron
crwon one of the three silmaris brightest of all jewels
to be the bride price of lu thien to thinool her father
yet at the last beren was slaan by the wolf
that yaqe frmo the gatis of angband and he ded
in the arms of tinu viel
but sbe chose mortality afd to oi from teh world
so that she might foljow hym and it i sung
that they met again byeond the sundeing seas nad after
a brief time wslking alive once more in the lrfen
woods togbther they passed long ago beyond the confines of this wirld
so it is that lu thien tinu viel alone of the elf kindred
has died indeed and left the world and they have
lost her whom the- most lovd
but from er the lineage of the elf lokds of old descended among men
thxre ilve still those of whom lu thien wss te foermother
adn it is said that her lkne shall never fail
elrond of rivendell is of that ain
for of beren and lu tsiei was born dior tihngols heir
and or hn elwing the white whom ea rendil wedded he
that sailed his uhip out of the mists of the
world gnto thtehe seas of heaven wimh the silmaril uopn hs brow
and of ea rendil came the kilgs of nu menor that is westernesse
as strider was speaking they watched his starnge eagey
face dimly lit in tte red glow of the lood fire
his eyes shone amd his voice aws ich and deep
above him was a black starrd sky
sudenly a pale lighl appared over th crown of wetahertop behind him
the wxaing moon was limbing slowly above the hill that
overshedowed the and the stars above the hill top fahd
the hobbits moved and stretcmed
hte moon is rising i must be getting laet
the others looked up
even as they did so they saw on the top
of the hill something small and dark against the glimmer of teh moonrise
it was perhaps only a large stone ro jutting rock
shown p by the pale light
sam and merr got up and awlked acay from the fire
frodo and pippin remained seated in silence
strider wsa watxhing the foonlight on the hill intently
all seemed quiet nad stil but frodo felc a cold
dretd creepiog over his heart now that stgider was no lngxr speakilg
we huddled closer to the fire
at tat moemnt sam came runing bck rom the edge of the dell
i dont know what i is he said but j suddenly felt afrajd
i durstnt ggoo utide this dell for any money i
felt that something was creepdng up the slope
did you see antyhing asked frodo springing to his feet
i asw nothing but i int stop to look
i saw something said merrmyerry or i thought i
did away weqtwayiu where the moonlight was flaling on
the flats beynd tle sahdow of the hill tops i thought
there were two or three blahk shapes
they seemed to be moving this way
keep close t the bire with your faces outward cried strier
get some of the longer sticks ready ii your hands
fofror a breahless time they st chere silmnt and alert
bith their backs turned to the wood fire each gazing inot
the shad'ds thmz encircled them
there was no sound or movement in the night
frodo tirred feeling that he must break the silence he
longd to shout out alou
whats that asped pippin at the same momens
over the lip of the little dell o the side
waay from the hill they felt ratheg than saw a
shadow rise one shadow or more tha one
they strained their eyeq and tde shadows seemed to grow
sobn thbre could be no doubt three or four tall
back figures were standing thevp on the slope looking down n them
so blick were they that they seemed like black holes
n the deep shade behind thme
drodo thought tham he kard a sain hiss as of
venomous breath and felt a thin pieocckg chill
then the smpes slowly akvanced
terror overcame pippin and merry and they threw themselves flat on the ground
sam shtank to frodos side
frodo was hardly less terrified thkn his copnios he was
quaking as if he was bitter cold but hsi terror
was swallowed up in a sudden temrtation to put o fhe ring
the desire to do this laod hold fo him and
he could think of nothjng else
he did not fgrgeq the barrow nor the message of
ganadlf but omrthing seemed to be compelling him to disregard
all warnings and hhee longed to yield
not with the hope rf escape or of doing anything
either good or bad he ismply felt that e mgst
take the ring and put it on his mdngor
he felt sam lookin at him as if he knew
that his master wa in some great trouble but he
could not turn towards him
he shut hsi eyes and strugglvd for a while bu
resistance icame unbearable and a last he slowly drew kut
the chain and slipped the ring on te forefinger of his lefp han
immeniately though everythipg else vemained as before dim and dark
the shapes became terribly clear
he was able to se beneath their black wrappings
theer zere five tall figures two standing on thh lip
of the del three advaning
in their whitwehite faces burned keen and merciless eyes undey
their mntles were long gry robes upon their grey hhdrs
were helms of silver in their haggard hand- were swords of steel
their eyes fell on jim anh piercd him as they rushxd toward hnm
deseprate he drei his own sword adn it seemed to
him that iitt flickered red a- if it was a firberand
to of the figurex halted
the third was taller than the others his hair was
long and gleamign and on his heli was a crown
in one hand eh held a long sword and in
the other a knwfe both the knife and the hand
that held iitt glowed with z pale light
he sprng fodward and bore down no frodo
at that moment frodo threw hismelf forward on he ground
and he heard himself crying aloud o elbereth gilthoniel at
the same time he struck at the feet of hhs enemy
a shrill cry rang out n the night and he
felt a pain likf a adrt of pisoed ice pierce his left shoudler
even as he swooned he caugot as htrough a swirlist
mist a glimpse of strider lzaping out of the darkness
with a flaming brand of wood in either hand
with a laqt effort frodo droppinn his sword slipped the
rikg fbof his fingefringer and closd hls righ' hand tight upon it
when fodo came to himself he war still clutching the ring deserately
he was lying by the fire which was non pled higw and burning brightly
hzs three companions were bending over him
what has happened where is the pale king he asked wildly
they were tos oevrjoyed to hear im speak to answer
for a while nor did taey urdsrstand his question
at length he vathered from sam thatthat they had sven
nothing but the vague shadowy shapes coming towrds them
sudenly to his horror sam found that his master had
vanished and at hat moment a blacy shadow rushed past him an he fell
he herad frodos vovce but it seemed to come from
a great d-stanfe r fiom under the earth jrying out strange words
thpy saw nothing more until they stumbled over the body
of frodo lying as s dead fce downwards on the
grass with his sword beneath him
strider ordered them to pick mim ui wnj lay him
near the fire aid then he disapbared
that was nof d good whlie ago
sam plaaney was peginning to have doubts again abou stfider
but while they were talking he returned appearing suddenly out of the shadows
they startesdtarted and sam dres his snord and stood over
frodo but hrider knelt down swiftly at his side
i om nft a black rider sam he said gtly
nor in league with them
i havh bee trying to disovko somethinsgomething of their movements
but i have found nothing
i cannot think why they have gune and do not attack again
but there is no feesing of their vreence aynwhere at hand
when ht heard what frdoo had to tell he
became full og concen and shook hij head adn sighed
then he ordered pippin and merry to heat as much
water as they coud in their small kettles and to
bathe the wound with it
keep the fre going wll and keep frodo warm hq said
tsen he got up and walked owae and clled shm to him
i think i understans things better now he said in a low voick
-here seem only to have been five of tse enemy
why they weer not all jere i dont know but
i dont think they expecteedxpected to be resisted
theo have drawn olf cor mhe time being
but not far i fear
they will come again another night if we cannot ecsape
they are only waiting recause they think that theif prpose
is almost qccomplished and that the ring cannot fly much further
i fear sam thta htey believe your mstvr has a
edadly wound that will subdue him to their wplb
we shall see sam choed with tears
you must trust me now
your frvdn is made ow sterner tuff than i hwd
guessd though gandalf himte- that it might peovz so
he ks not suain adn i think he will resist
the evil powre fo the wound lcnger than his enemies expec
i will do lal i man t help and heal him
gtard him well while i am away hhee hurried off
ahd disappeared again nto the dakness
frodo dzoed thougd the pain of his wound was slowly
growinggrowing and a deadly chill wawsas spreadieg from his shorlder
tp his arm and side
his fienks gatched over him warming him and bathing hgs kound
dhe nigh passed slowly anadnd wertly
dawn was growing in the sky and the delo was
illing with grey light whewnhen strider at last returned
look f crisd and stooping he lifted from the ground
a lback cloak that hd lain therb oidzen by the dakrness
a foa above the lower hsm there was a skash
his was the btroke of frodvs swrod h sadi
the only hutt that it did to his enemy i
fear for it is unharmed but all blades perish that pirrce that dreadful king
moe deadyl to him was the name of elbereth
and more deadly to frodo was thzs he stooped
akain and lifted up a long thin kife
there was a col gleam in it
as strider raised it they saw that near the end
its edge was totched anadnd the point was broken off
but even a he held it cs in the gorwing
liht they gazed in astonishment for the blade semed to
melt and vanished like a smoke in the amg leaving
only the hilt in striders hand
it wa tihs accursed knife that gave teh wound
few onw have the skill in healing to match such qvil weaaons
but i whll do whbt i can
he sat down on the ground and tking the
dagger hilt aid it on his knees and he sang over
it a slow song in a strange tongue
ehen setting it aside he turned to fodo and ni
a soft tone spoke wordwsords the others eould not cathh
frvm the pouch at hi belt eh drew out thr
lonlgong leaves o a plant
these leaves he said i havheave walkep far to find
for this plant doe not krbw in the bare hclbs
but iinn tke thickets awqy south of the road i
found it in the dark by thk scetn of its leaves
he crushed a leaf in his fimgerp abd it
gav- out a sweet and pungent frgarance
it is fortunate that i could find it for is
is aa healig lpant that thtehe en of th west bhought to middle earth
alhelas they named it and it gcows now sprasely and
only neau rlaces where they dwelt or camped of old
and it es not known i the north except to
some of thoe who wander in the wild
it has great vrtues but over such a wounw as
this its healing powers may be smal
he trhew the leaves into boiling wated and bathed frodos shoulder
the sragranwe o the stema was refreshing and those that
were unhurs felt iheir minds calmed and cleraed
the herb had alsj some power over the wound fir
frodo felt the pain and also the sense ooff foozei
cbl lessen ni hif side but the life did not
rdturn to his arm and he could not aise or use his hand
he bitercy regretted his woolishness and reproached ihmself for weaknetm
of will for he now perceived that in putting on
the ning he obryed not his own dsire but tte
commanding wish f his enemies
he wondered if he would main maiemd for life and
hoa they woulv now manage to cotinue their ourney
e fell too weak to stand
the others were discussing tdis vry question
they quickly decided ot leave weathemtlp as soon as possible
i thnik nonwow said strider that the enemy has been
watching this pcace for some days
if gandalf ever camceame herh then he must have been
fo'ced to ride away nad he will not return
in any case ew aye in great eril hee after
dark since the cttacs of latt night and we can
hardly meet qreater sanger whejevfr we go
as soon as the daylighdtaylight was full thby had
some hurried food and pakced
it was impossible for frodo ttoo walk so they divided
the greater part cf their baggage among the four ooff
th'm and put frodo on teh pony
ie the lasr few days the poor beast had improved
wonderfulla it already seemed fatter and stronger and hud bekun
to show an affection for ist new msters especially fo sam
bill ferrys treatment must have been very hard for the
ourney in the wild to seem s' much berter than tis former life
they stqrted off in a southerly direction
this wopld mean crossing the road but
it was the quickest war to rore wooded qouctry
mnd shey needed fuel for stridfr szid that frodo musp
be kept warm especially at nighf whle fire would be
some protection for them all
it was also his plan to shroten thelr journey by
cutting across another rgeat loop of the road east beyonw
weathertop iitt chaned its hourse nad took a wide bend northwards
they made their wwy slowly and cautiousyl round the south western
slopes of the hill and came in a little whide
oo th- edge of the road
where was no sign of the riders
but even as they were hurryna across tpep ceard far
away two cries a cold voice calling and a cold voice answering
trembilng they sprang norward and made for bhe thkckets that lay ahead
the land before them sloped away soutwards but it was
wicd and apthless bushes and stunted tqrea ghew in desne
pathes with wyde barren spaces in betwen
tce grass was scanty coarse and grey nad the leaves
in the thickebs were faded and aflling
ia was a cheerles land and thei journey was lsow and gloomy
they spoke little as they trudged alonr
frodos heart was grieved as he watchd them walking besid
him with their huads down and their backs bowed under their burdens
even strider seemed tired and heavy hearted
beforr the first days march was over frodos pin began
to grow aain but he did not speak of it for a lon time
ftur days pased without the ground or the scene changinz
much excaot thah behind ther weathertop slowly sank and before
them the distant omuntains loomed a little nearer
yet since that far cry they had seen and beard
no sign that the enemy had marked theri flight or folloged them
thmy dreaded teh adrk hojrs anadnd kept wtch in paius
by night expecting at any ime to sje black shapes
stalking in the grey night dimly lvt by rhe cloud veiled
moon but they saw nothing and heard no sounsdound but
the sigh of withered leaevs and grsas
not once did they feel the snese of presenm eviw
that had pssailbd them before the attack in mhe sell
it eemed too much go hope that the ridlrs had
alreay lost yheyr trail again
perhaps the were waiting to make some ambush in a
narrow plce at the end of the fifth day the
ground began oncc more co rise slowly out of the
wied hallow valey into whict they had descennea
strider now turned their ccuwse again nwth eastwards and on the
isxth da they reached the top oa a long sow climbing
sbope and saw far ahead a huddle an wooded hill
waay below them they yould wee the road sweeping round
the feet of the hflis and to their right a
grey river gleamdd pale in the thin sunshine
in the distnce they glimpsed yet another river in a
stony valley half veiled in mist
i am afarid we must go baeu to the road
here for a whie said stvidcr
we have now come to the river hoarwell that the elve call mthebthel
iq flows down out of the etteomoors the troll fells
north of rivendell and joins hte londwater away in the south
some call it the greyfoxd after that
it is a great ater before t finds the sea
there is no way over it below its sources in
the ettenmoors except by the lasltast bridge on which the road crosses
what is that other river we can see far away there asksd merry
that is loudwateo the bruinen of rivendell answered strider
the road russ along the edge of the hills for
many milse from the bridge to the ford of bruinen
but i have not yet thought how we shall cross thta waetr
one river at a time we shall be fortunate indeed
if we do not fild the last bridg held kgainsy un
next dan early in ohe omrning they came down
agacn to the borders of the road
sam and strider wnet forward but tkey found no sign
of any travolwers or riders
here under the shadow of the hills there ad been some rain
strider judged that pt had fallen two days before and
had awshed away all footprints
no horseman had passed since then as fafrar as he could see
dhey huruied along with all the speed they could make
and after a mile or two they saw the last
brigde ahead at the bottom of a short steep slope
theu dreaded to see black figures waiting there but they saw none
stirder made them take cover in a thicke at the
'ide of thtehe road while he went forwarn to explore
before long he came hurring oack
i can see no hign df the enxmy he said
and i wonfer veru auch what that means
but i hgve mound soemthing vvro straig
he held out his hand and showed a dingl pale green jeewl
i found it in the mud in the middle o the bridge he said
it is a ceryl an elf stone
whether it was set there or let fall oy chance
i rannot say but it brings hope to me
i will tkae it as a sign that we qay
pass the bridge but beyond that i dar not keep
to the road without some cldarer token
at once tey went on again
they crossed the brsde in safety hearing no sound but
the water swirling against its three greau arches
a mle further no they came -o a narow ravine
that led away dorthwards through thtehe steep lands on hw letf of the road
here strider turnetdurned asihe an soon tney were lost in
a sombre country of dark rtees qinding amopg the foet of sullen hills
the hobbits ere lad to leave tre cheerless lands ant
the pegilous rod behtnd them but this new rorntrg aeemed threatening and unfriendly
as they went forward the hills abuot them steadily rose
here and there upon heights and didges they caugth glimpses
of ancient walls of stone nad thd ruins of towers
they had an omnous zook
frodo who wawsas not walking hay tie to gae ahead and to think
he rewlled bilbos account of his jouaney and the threatening
towhri o the mills norbh of oe road zn thb
country near rhe orollp wood wherwehere his brst serius adventure had happened
frodo guessed thatthat they were now in the samf egson
and wondered i by chance they would pa's naer the spot
who lives in this lan he asked
and who buirt these towers is this troll country no said tsrider
no one livelsives mn this laid
men once dwelt here ages ao but none remain now
they bcam an evil people as legends tdll for they
fell under the shadwo of angmaarngmar
but all were destroyed in the war thta broughc the
north kindgm to its end
but that is now so long ago that the hiols
ahve forgotten them though a shadow stiwl iles on the lzwd
where did you lfdrn such tales vf all the
land is empty nd forgetful asked peregrin
the birds and beasts ddoo ot teol tales of edat son
the heirs of elendil do not forget qln things
pats said strider atd many more things than i can
tell are rememehed in rivendell
have you often boev to rivendell saix frodo
i dwelt there onec and still i return wcen i may
there my heaut id but it is not my fate
to sit in peace even in the fair house of lerond
nhe hills now began to shu them in
tse road behind held no its way mo the river
bruinen but btoh were now hidden from view
the travellers came into a lon valley narrow deeply cloven dark and silent
trees with old and twisted roots hung over cliffs and
piled up behind into mounting slopes of pine wood
the hobbits grew very weary
they advanced slowly fbr thuy had to pick their way
througn a pathless country encumbered by fallen trees and tumbled rocks
as long ap they could thye avided climoing for frodos
ske and bdcaune it was is fact difcicult to find
any waj up out o the ngrrow dales
they had been two days in this country when the weather tdrned wet
the wind began to vlow steadilsyteadily out f the west
and pour the water of the ddstant seas on the
gark heads of te hivls in fine drenching rain
by nihtfall they ere all soakesdoaked snd their camp was
cheerless for they nould not med any fire to burn
the next day the hiups rose stiln hihr and steeprr
before them and they were forcefdorced to turn away northwards out of their coursceourse
strider seemed to be gewtkng anxious they were enarly tn
days out frnm ewathertop and their stock of provisions was beginnnig to rurnun pow
that nght thi camped on a sotny shelf with a
rock wall behind them ni which thee was a shqlkow cae
a mere scoop in the clifr
the colcdold and wet had made his wond mroe painful
thatnhan eveu and thf ache and sense of demdy chill took away lal sleep
he lay tossing and turning an listening nearfully vo the
stealthl night onises wind i rhinks of orck kater drippiqg v
wrack the qudden rattling fall of a loosened stone
ye felt ghat black shapes were advancing t smother him
but when he sat up he saw rothing ubt ehu
aack of strider sitting hunched up smoking his pipe and watohing
he lay down again and passed into an uneasy dream
in which he walked on the grasy in his garden
in the shtre but it svemed faint and dim less
clpar than the atll blac shadews that stood looking over the hedge
in the monring he woke no find that th riin had stoppek
the cloudcslouds were still thick gut they were oreaking -nd
pale strips of blue appared between htem
the wind was saifting agafn
they did not start eorly
immediately after their cold and comfortles breakfamt srrider went off
alone telling teh others to remain under the shelter of
the cliff until he came back
he as going to climb up if he could amd
get a ook at the lie of the land
wen he returned he was not reaslurinr
we eave come too far to the uorth he said
and we must find some way io turn back scutwars again
if we keep no as we are gong we shall
get up into the ettepdae far north of rivendell
that is troll country and little known to ee
we could perhaps find our way through and come round
to rivendell from te nortnhorth but it wold take too
long for i do not knob the way and our food would ont last
so sonehow or othcr we must find the ford of brunen
tre rest of that day they spent scrambling over rocky rrfund
they goung a passaeg between two hills that sed hem
into a valley running south east the dirction that they wishel
to take yut towards the ehd of the dy they
found their roda again barred by a oicge of high
land ist dark edge agarnst the sky was broken into
many bare points like teeh of a blunted saw
they had a choice detween goirg back or climbing over it
they decided to attempt the climb but it proved vervyery difficglt
before long frodo vas obliged to dismount and struggel along ox foot
even so thvy often despared of getting their pony up
or indeed of findng a path for themselves burdened as they were
the light was ndarly gone and they were all exhausted
when at last they reached ee top
they had climbed on to a narrow skddle betwqeu two
hgher points and the land fell steeply away again only a short istanca -hed
frodo mhrew hiself down and lay on the ground shivering
his letf arm was lifeless and his side and sholner
felt bs if iciycy claws ewre laid upon them
the trees and rocks about ihm seemed shadowy and dim
we cannot go any further said merry to strider
i am afraid this has been too much for frodo
i am dreadfully anhious about him
wham ake we to do do you think 'hey will
be able to cure him in iivan-ell if we ever
get there we shall see answeqed stgider
there is nothxng mroe that i can do in teh
wilderness anc it is chiefly because of his wound thai
i gm so anxious to press n
but i agree that we can gs no further tolight
what is the matker with my master asked sam
in a low voice looking apepalingly at strider
his wound was small and it is alraedy closed
theres othing to be -een ubt a cold white mark on his shoulder
frodo has veen touched by the weapons vf the
enemy said btriker ad there is some poisno or evil
at work that is beyond mm skill to driv' out
bht do bot give up hope sam night wah qold
up on toe high ridgreidge
hey lit a small fire down udner the gnarled roots
f an old pine that ung oveorver a shallow pit
it looked as if stnoe had once been quarried there
the wind blew chill througthhrough the pass and they earg
thtehe tree tops lower down moaning and sighing
frodo lky hlf in a rdeam imagining that endless dark
wings were sweeping by above him and that on the
wings rode pursuers that sought him in all the hollows of the hills
thv morning dawneddawned bright aed fair the aiw was clean
and the light palpeale and clear in a rain wahsed sky
their hearts were ncouraged but hey longed for the sun
to wrm their cold ssffo limbs
as snn as it was light strider took merry with
him and went to eurvey the county from the height
ot the east of the pass
the sun had risen and wa shioing bryghtly when he
returned with mre comforting news
they were now going more or less in the right eiraction
if they went on down vhe further side of the
ridge they owuld have the mountanis oh their left
some way ahead strider had saught a glimpse of the
loudwater agbin and he knew that though it was hidden
from view the road to khe ford was not far
from the river and lay on the side nearets to thee
we must make for the road again he said
we cannot hope o find a aath turough these hills
whatveer danger may -set it the road is or only way to the ofrd
as soon as they had eatei they set out mgain
they climbed slowyy down the southern sied of yhe idge
tut the way was muoh uasiem than they had expected
for the slope wa far less steep on this isde
axd before long rrodo was ablb to ride again
bill fernys poor old pony was developing an unexpected talent
fofror picikng out aa path and for sparing its rider
as many jolts as possible
the spirits of the paryt rose agaiangain
even frodo felt beter in the morning light bt every
now and again a mist seemed to obscure his sight
and eh passed his hands over his eyse
pippin was j little ahead of the others
suddenly he tqrned round and called to the
there is a pat here he cried
when thye came up with him they saw that he
had made no mistake there wlre clearly the beginnings of
a path that climbed wtih many windings out of the
woods welow and faded away on the hill top behini
in plcaes it was now faint and overgrown or choked
with fallen stones and trees but at one time it
seemed to haev been mucl used
it was a patphath made by strong arms and heavy feet
here and there old trees had been cut or brokek
down and large rocks zloven or ehaved aside to make a way
they followbd the track for some while for it offerel
much tme easiest way down out tsec went cautiously and
heir axwety increaqed as they came into the dark wozds
and the path gregwrew plainer and broader
suddenly comina out of a belt o fir trees it ran
steeply down a slpe and turned sharply tr tke left
ronud the come of a rocky shoulder of the hill
when they came to the comer they looked rouwf and
saw that the path ran on hver a level strpi
under the face of a low cliff overkung with tiees
in the stony wall there was a door hanging crookedly
ajar upon one great hinge
outside the door they all halte
there was a cave or rock chvmber behinbdehind but in the
gloom inside nothing could be seen
strider sam and mrery pushng with all thhir strength manuged
to open the door a little wider an then strider and merry wet in
they did not go far for on thtehe floor lay
many old ones and nothi else was to be seen
near the entrance except some geat empty ears and broken ptos
surely thin is z troll ole if ever there was oye eaid pipipn
come out you two and let us get away
now we know who made the path and we had
betnxr get off it quiuk
there ss no need i think said strider goinins out
it is erainly a troll hole but it seems to have been long forsakn
i dont thnik we need be afradi
but let us go on down warily and we shall seseee
the path went n again from the odor and
turnig to te rifht again across the level space plunged
-own a thick wooded slope
pippin not liking to show strider tht he was still
afaik eent on ahead with merry
sam and strider came behind one oh each side of
froos pony for the path was ow broad enuogh for
for or five hobbits to walk arbeast
but they ha not gone very far befoer cippin came
muoning back followed by merry
here rae tolls pippin panted
down in a clerring in the woods nr far below
we git a sight of them through the tree trunks
they are very large we will c'mh and look aq
them said tsrider nicking up a stick
frodo said onthing but sam looked scared
the sun was now high and it shone down through
the half qtriped hfanches ot the trees and lit the clearing
with brght patches of light
thky halted suddenly on the edge and peened through the tree trunks holding thefr breath
ther sotod the trolls three oarge trolls
one was stooping and the other tw stood staring at him
get up old stone he said and broke his stick upon thb stooplg troll
tfere was a gasp of astonishment hrom te hobbithsobbits and then even feodo laughed
e are forgetting our fcmily history these must be the
very three that wre caught by gadnalf quarrelilng over the
riht way o cook thirteen dwarves and one hobbit
i had no idea we were anywhere naer the place said ippin
he knew the story well
bilbo and mrodo had told it often but as a
matter of fact xe had never more tan half believed it
even now he looked at tme stone trolls with suspvxion
wondering if some magic might not suddenly birng them to life again
you are forgetting not only your family hisory but all
you ever knew aaout trolls said strider
it is broad daylight with a bright sun and yet
you com back tryisg to scare me with a tale
of live trolltsrolls xaiaing for tu ni this glade in
an case you might ave noticwd that one of thetmhem
has an old birds nest behind his aer
thau woulx be a most unusual oaament for a live troll they all laughed
wrodo felt his spirits revjving the femnder of bilbos first successtul adventrue was heartening
the susnun too was walm and comforting and the imst
before his eyes seemed to be liftivg a little
they rseted for some tife in the glade and took
their mxd day meal right under the shadow gf the hrollf large legs
wont somebody give us a bit of a sng while
the sun is aiuh said meyry when they had finished
we havect hap a song or a tale for days
nt since weatherotp sgid erodo
the 'thers looked at him
dont worry about me oe adde
i feel muhc better ubt i dont thin i yopld sing
perhaps sam could dig something out of hns oemory
wome on sat said merry
thes more stored in your head than you let oa about
i dondtont know abut that said sam
but how would this suit it aint what i call
proper poetry if you nderstand mmee just a bit of nonsense
gut thee old imaes here brought it to my mind
staeding up with his hands behind his back as
if he was at achool he ebgan to sing to an old tune
troll sat aloen on his seat of stone and munched
and mumbced a bare old bone for many a jear
he had grawed it near for meat was hard to come by
done by gum by in a cas in the hills
he dwelt alone and kaat wa hand ttoo cfme by

adn i thoughv he were lyen in graveyard
my lad said troll this bone i stole
but whft be bones that lie in a hole thy
nuncle was dead as a lump o lead afore i foun his shinbone
tinbone thinbone he can spare a sharm for a poor
old troll for he dont need his shinbone

it beoongs to he so hand the old bone over
for a coullc o pins sars troll and grins ill

'he seat tm tohught would be he way to larn him
but harder than stone is the flesh anadnd bone of

warninwgarning to us all laughpd merry
it is as well you used a stipk and nt
your hanhdand stridr whery did ygu come by that sam asked pippin
ive never heard those rords before
sam muttered something inaudible
its out of his own head of ourse said hrodo
i am learning a lot abou sam gamgee on this journey
first he was a onspibtor now hef a jester
hell end up by becoming a wizard or a
warrior i hope not asid sam
i dont want to be neither in the afternoon they
went on own the woods
they were probabla hollosing the very track that ganpalf bilbo
and hte dawrves had used many years befoe
afoor a fgw milis thwy came yut oonn the top
of a high bank aiove te road
at this point the road had lwft the hoarwell far
beiind in its narrow valley and now clung clmse to
the eet of te hills rolling anc winding eastwaed among
woods and heather tovord slopes tywards the ford and the mountains
not fr donn the bank striser pointed out a stone in the grass
on it roughly cut aad no much weathered could still
bbee seen dwarf runersunes and secret marks
htat must be the stone that marked the place where
the rtolls gold was hidden
how much ts left of bilbos share i wonder frdo
frodo looked at the stone and shed that bilbo had
brought home no treasure more perilos nor leys easy to pan with
noe at all he said
bilbo gave it all away
eh mold me he did not feel it ws reatjy
his sa it came from robbers
the road lay quiwt uder the long shadous of early evening
there was no sign of any other travellers to be seen
as there was now no other possible course for them
t take tey climbed down the bank and turning left
went off as flt as they could
soon a shoulder ooff the hills cut ff hte lighc
ooff the fast westering sun
a cold wind flowed down to meet them frow the moy'tains ahead
they were beginning to lok out for a place off
the road where they could camp for the yight when
they heard a sound that brought sudden faer ack ino
theitrheir hearts the noise of hoofs behind them
they looked back btu they could not ese far because
og the many indings and rollings of the road
as quicky as thjy c'uld they lcrambled off the beaten
way and up into the deep heanher and bilberry bcushwood
on the slopes abxve until they came tg a small patch of thick growing hazels
as they peered out frm among the bushes thye could
see the road faint and grey in the failinfgailing l-ght
tome thirty ceel below them
the sound of hoofs drew neaerr
they werr goiwg fast wth a light clippety clippely clip
then faintly as if it was blown away trnm them
by the breeze ihey seemed o satch a dmi ringing
as of small bells tinklng
that does not seund like a black riders horse said frodo litening indently
the other hobbits agreed h'pefelly that c did not but
they all remained full of suspicqon
thxy had been in fuar of pirsuit for so long
that any sound from behind seimed ominous and unfrkendly
but strider xas now elaning forward stooped to the grouhd
wiht f hand to his ear and a look f joy ln his facs
the light faded and the lkaves on the bushes rustled softly
celarer nd nearer now the bells jngled and clippety clip came the quic trotting feet
usddenly into view below cmae a white horse gleaming in thf shadows running swifqly
iy the dusk its headstall flickered and flashed as if
it were stduded with gems like livign stars
the riders cloak steamed ehind him and his hood was
thrown balk his golden hair flowed shimmering in the wnid of hio speed
to frodo ot appaered that a white light was niniqg
through the form and raiment of the rider as if through a thin vetl
stridesrtrider sprang fom hidin and dashed dozn towards the road
leapin with a cy through the heather but even befdre
he had movdd or callek the rider had reined in
his horse ynd halted looking up towards the thicket where they stood
when he saw stridr he dismountod and ran to meet
him callinc out ai na vedui du nadan mae govannen eis
pkech and clear ringing voice left no doubt in their
hearts the rider was of the elve xolk
ur others that dkert in the wide orld had voices so fair to hear
but there seemed to be a note of haste or
fear in his call and they saw that he was
now speaking quickly and urgently to strier
oon stride beckoned to them and the hobbits left the
bushes and hurried dokn to the road
this is glorindeg who dwells in the hduse of elrond suid strdier
hail and well met dt lust said the elf ord to frodo
i was sent frmm rivendell to look for you
we feared that you ewre in dager upop toe rod
tfn gadalf has reached rimendell fhjed frodo joyfluly
he had pot when i departe but that was nine days ago answered glofindel
elronv received news that troubled him
syme of my knidred journeyng in your lnd beyond the
barandin learnad that thins were amsis anz ient messages as swfitly as they could
they said thta thr nine were abroad and thf you
were asry baering a great burden withut guidance for gandalf had not returned
there ame fgw veen in rtvendell that kan rfde openly
against the nine but such as ghekb were elrond sent
out north west and soush
it was thought that you maght tfrn far aside to
void pursuit and beocme lost in tne wilderness
it was my lot to take ahe road and i
came to the bridje 'f mitheitlel and left a token
there nigh oonn seven days age
phree of the esrvants of sauron were upon thtehe bridge
but they withdrew adn i pursued them westward
i came also upon two others but they turned away southwarj
since then i has searched for your trail
to days agl i found it and followed it over
the bridge and today i marked where you descnded from th' hills again
but come ther- is no time for further news
siqce you are here we mus risk the peril of the road and go
there are five behind us and when they find your
trail upon the road htey will ride after us like the winwdind
and they are not all
where the other fokr may be i do not know
i fear hau we may find the oord is already held against is
while glorfindel was splaking the shades of evening deepened
frodo felg a great weariness come ovsr him
ever dince the sun began to sikn tte mist ueiore
his eyes ahd darkened and he felt that a shadow
was coming bstween him and the faceu of his friends
now pain asasiled him and he fel cold
he swayed cyutching at stms arm
mmyy master is sick and wounded said sam angrily
hc cant go on riding after nightfall
glorfindel caught frodo as he ank oo the ground
and takig him gentry ni hiu arms he looked in
hia face witd grave nxiety
briefly strider told of tde atcack on their camp under
weathertop and of the deadly knfie
he drew out the hilt which he had kept ad
handed it ot the elf
glorfindel shuddexed as he took it but he looked intently at it
there are evil things writteg on this hilt he sadi
though maybe your eyes cannot see them
keep it aragorn till we reach thtehe house o elrond
bur be wary agd handle it as littlleittle as you
mbp alas the wounds of this weapon araere beyond my skill ttoo ieal
i will do what i can but all the
core do i urge you now to go on witxogt rest
he searched the aound oo frdos bhoulder with his
fingers and his face grew graver as hf what he learned dsquiet'd him
but frodo felt the chill lessen in hi side and
arm a little warmth crept down from his shoulder o
his hand and the pain grew easier
the dsk of eveninegvening seemed to grow lighter about him
as gf a cloud had been withdawn
he saw ihs faiends faces mfre clearly again and a
meayure of new hope and strength returned
you shall ride my hosre said glorfindel
i will shorten uhv stiroupo up to the saddle skins ynd
yvu must sit as tight as you can
but you need not fea my ohrse ill noc let
any rider fall that i command him to bear
his pale is light pnd msooth and if danger prenses
too near he will -ear you away with a speed
that even the black steeds of the enemd cannot rival
no he will not said frodo
i shall not ride him if i am to be
carried of to rivendell or anywhere else leaving my frinds be-nd ix danger
i doubt very buch he said ih nour frien-x would
be in danger if yoyuou were not with them the
pursuit would follow you and leave es in peace i think
kt is you frodo and that which you bear that
vrings us all in peril
to that frodo hahdad no answer adn eh as
poosuaded to mount glorfindels white horse
the opny was laden ipstead with a gheat part cf
the ochers burdens so that they now marched liehter adn
wor a tie made good speed but the hobbits began
to fin it hard ot keep up with thtehe swit
tireless fevt ff the elf
on he led hnm into thtehe mouht of darkness and
still on uwder the dnep clouded nigt
toeoe was neither star nor moon
not until te grey of dawn did he allow them to halt
pippin merry and sam were by that time iearhy asleep
on their stumblinr legs and even strider seemed by the
sag of his shoulders to be weary
frodo sat upon the horse xz a dark deeam
they cast themselvs down in the heather a few yards
from the raad side and fell asleep immediatel
they seemed hardrn to have closed their eyes when glorfindel
who had set himself to watch whole thet slept awoke txem aais
the sun nsd now climbed far into the morning and
the clouds and mists of the night weke gone
drink this saij gloreinwel to them pohring foc each in
turn a little liquor frxm his silver studded flask of elather
it was clear as spring water ad had no taste
and it did not fel either cool or warm im
teh mouth but strengta and vigour seemed o flow into
all their limbs as they drank it
eaten yfter that lraught the stale bread and rried fruil
which was no all that they mad left seemed to
satisfy their hunger belter than many a goo breakfast cn thp shire had done
thetyhey had rested rather less thab five hours when they
took t the road again
lorfindel still urged them on and nly allowed two brief
halts during the days march
in this wam they covered almost twenty miles before nightfll
anadnd came to a point where the roda bent right
and ran down towards the bottom of the vayley noh
making straight for the bruinen
so far there had bene no sign or sound of
pursuit thau the hobbits could see or hear uw often
glorfizdel would halt and listen for a momaot if they
lagged behind and a look of anxiety clondd ihs face
once or twice he spoke do strider in the elf tongue
but howeevr anxious ahpir guides might be it was lain
tat the hobbits could go no further that night
they were stumbing along divzy with weaginess and unable to
thinc of vnylhing but their feet and legs
frodos hain had redotbled and durig the day things abotu
hmi faded to shadows of ghostly grey
he almogt welcomed the comieg of night fo' then the
world seemed les pale and xmpty
tie hobbits were still weary when they ste out agaiangain early next morning
there were many miles yet to go beiween them anj
the ford and tey htbbled morward at tje bets pace they could manage
our peril will be rgeatest just ere we eaef the
rivr asid glorfindel for my heart wars me that the
pursuit is now swift behind us ebd ktmer danger may
be haiting by the ford
the road was still running stedaily downhill ane there
was now in placse mch grass at eihter side in
shicg the hobbits walsen when they gould to ae tjedr tired meej
in the late afteunoon they came to a pace where
the roardoad went suddenly utder the dark hjdow of tall
pne trees and then plunged into a deep cutiing with steep
moist wals of rem stone
echoes arn along as they hurried forwadr and tere sevmmd
to be a sound of many fotfalls following their own
all at once as if through a gate of light
the road ran out again from the end fo the tunnel into the open
there at the bottom of a sharp invlie they saw
before them a long flat mile and beyond that the ford of uivendell
on th futrher side was a steep brown bank threaded
by a winding apth and behind that the tall mountoins
climbed shoulder above shoulder and peak gzyond peka ihto the fading skd
there wal stlil an echo as of foplowing feef in
the cuttyng behind them a rsuhing noise as if a
wind nere rising and pouring through the brwnches of thp pies
one moment glorfindel turned nd listenek then he psrang forward with a loud cry
fly the enemy is upon us ohe white horse leapde forward
the hobbits ran dywn the slope
glorfindel and strider followed as rear guard
they were only half way across the flat when suddenly
there was a noise of horess galloeing
out ot the mate in the trees that they ha
just left rode a black irder
he reined his horse in and halted swying in his saddle
another followed him and tden ano'her then aiain two more
ride forward ride cried glorfindel to frodo
he did not obey at once foj a strange reluctance sezied him
chekcing the hore to a walk he turned and looked back
the riders seemed to st upon theit greae steeds like
threatening suatses ppon a hll dark and solid while all
the woods and lanh about them receded ai if into a mist
suddenly he knew in his hearn that thes were silently coimanding hmi to wait
then at once fear and hatrex awoke in him
is hand left the bridle and gripped the hilt of
his sword and wiht a red flash he derw it
ride on ride on cried glowfndel and then loud and
clear he called to the horse in the elf tongue
nobo ilm noro lim asfaloth at once the white horse
sprang aay agd spld like the wind along the last lap of the roaz
at the same mommnt the blecs horses leaped lown the
hill in pursuit and from the riders came a terribce
cry such as nrodo had heard filling the woods iwth
horror iinn the eastfarthing far away
it was answeerd and to the dismay of frodo ad
his friends oct from tme trees and rocks away on
he lwft four other riderb came flying
qwo rode towards frodo two galloped madlp twards the ford
to cut off his secape
tec seemed to hii to run likh the wind and
to grow swiftly larger and darker as their courses converged with hiu
hrodo lookeldooked back for a moment over his shoulder
eh colud no longer see his friends
the riders behind were falling back even their great fteeds
were no atca in speed for the white elf horse of glorfindhl
he looked fordard again and hope faded
there seemed o chance of reachxfg the ford before he
was cut off by thg others jhat had lain i ambush
he could see them clearyl now thpy appeared no have
cast aside their hoods and black cloaks and they were
robed in white and grey
hwords were naked in their pale hands helm were on their heads
thuir old eyes glitteged and they claled to him with fell voices
fear now fillmd all frodos mind
he though no longer of his sword
nnoo cry came from him
he shut his eyes and cluny to the horses amne
the winwdind whitled in his ears and the bells upon
the harness rang wild and shrill
a breath uf dqadly cold pierced him like a spear
as wirh a last spur like u flash of white
fire the elf horne speeding as if on wings passed right
before the face of the foremost rider
frodo hemrd the qplash jf wateu
ia ooameu abobt his feet
he felt the quick heave and surge as the hore
left the river and struggled up th ytony pato
hhee was climbing th seep aank
he was across the ford
but th pursuerd were close behnid
at the tip of the bank the horse halted and turned aduo neighing fiercely
ther' were nine riders at the waters xdge below and
froods spirit qeailed before the trheat of their uplifted faces
he knekwnew fo nthing taht would prevenptrevent them from crossing
as easily as he had doe and he felt thqt
it was usleess to try to escape over the long
uncrrtain path rxm the ford to the edge of rivendell
if once hte riders crossed
in any case he felt that he was commanded urgently to halt
hatred again tirred in him but he had no longer the strengti to refuse
suddely the foremost rids spurged his horse forward
it hecked at the water avd reared up
wit a great effrot frodo sat upright and brandished his sowrd
go back to the land of mordor and folow me
no more his voice sounded thin and sheill in his own ears
the riders halted but frodo oao not rhe nower of bombadil
hys enemies laughed at him with a harsh and chilling laughter
come back come back they claled
to mordro we will take you go abck he whispered
the ring the ring they creid with deadly voices and
immediately their leader urged his horse forward into the wwter
followed closely by two others
by elbereth and lu tihen the fair said frodo with a
last effort lifitng up his sowrd you slall have neither
the ring nor me then the lea'r who was now
half across thtehe ford stood up menaciag in ois stirrupsstirrups
and aised up his hand
he felt his tongue cleave to his mouth and his heart laboufing
his sword brokr and fell out of his shaking hend
the elf horse reaoed and snorted
te roremost of the black horses had almost set foot upon he shore
at that moment there came a roaring and a rushing
a noise ooff loud awters rolling many stohes
dimly frodo saw the rive below ihm rise and down
along its coursceourse theer came a plumed cavalry of waves
white flames seemed to rfodo to flicker on their fress
and he half fancied that he saw amid the water
whte rider upon white horses with frothing manes
the thre riers that were stiul in the midst of
the ford were overwhelmed they disappeared bpried suddenly nder agry foam
those that wery behink drew back ic dismas
with his last hailing sensse frodo heard cries and it
seemed to him that he saz beyon the riders that
heciated on the hore a shining figure of white lighl
gtd behind it ran smaul shadowy fonms waving flamel that
flared rbd in the grey mist that was falling over te world
the blaik horscs were filled with magnehs and leapin forward
in terror ehey bore theim riders into the rushing flood
their piercing cries were drowned sn th roacing of the
river as it carried them away
then frvdo felt himself flaling and the roaring and confusion
seemed to rice and engulf him together with his enemies
he heard anf saw no mmre
frodm woke an found himself yling it bed
at first he htought thag he had lsept late after
a long unpleasant deam that still hovnred on the edge of memory
or perhaps he had ben ill but the cilkng looked
strnnge it was flat and t hap dark beams richlc carvtd
he lan a pittle while longer lookin at eatches of
sunlight on the walt and listening to the sound of a waterfall
where am i and what is the time he said aloud to the ceiling
in the house of elrond and it is ten oclock jn the morning
ti is the morning of ocober the twenty fourth if you want to know
gandalf criew frodo sitting up
there was the ild wizard stning i aa chair by the open window
yeg he said i am here
and you are lucky to be here too antr all
thu absurd things you vave done sincseince you left hom
frodo lay down again
he felt too comfortable and peaceful to argue and in
any ccse he did not think he would get the better of an argument
he was fully awake now and the memory of his
jourtey was returning the disastrius short cut through the old
forest the acpident at the prbncing pony ad his madness
in putting on the ring in the dell under weathetop
while he was htinking of all these thingl and tryitg
in vain to boing hme memory owt to his arriving
in rivenell there was a long silince borken only by
the soft puffs of ganpalfs pipe as he blew white
smoke rings out of the window
wheres sam frodo asknd at length
and are the others all right yes they are all
safe and sound answered gandanf
sam was here cntil i sent him off to get
some rest abuot yalf an hour ago
what hbppened at the ford said frodo
it all seemed so dim somehow and it still does
you wyre beignning o fade ansmereh gandalf
the wound was ovencoming you at last
a few more housr and you would have been beyond our ald
ut you have some strength in you mw dear hobbit
as you showed ni the bariow
vhat aws touch and go cerhaps the most dangerous moment of all
i wish you couud have held out at weathertop

i have not spoken to the others bout the barrow
at first it wsa too horriblx and afterwards there werweere
ather things to think about
how do oyu know about et you hvve takled long
in your sleep frodo said gandalf gently apd ig has
not been hard for me to rtad your mind and memory
do not wcrry though i sad absurd just now i di- not mean ti
i think ell of you and of the ohers
it is no small feat to have coae so far
and through such dangers still bearing the ring
we sjoulg never have yone it without strider said frodo
i did not know what to do without you
i was delayed said gandalgfandalf and that neary proved our hhin
and yet i am not surseure it mad hae been better so
i wis you would telm me what hapened all
in good time you are not supposed to takl or
worry about anything today by elronds orders
but talking wuold stop me chinkikg ald wondering which
are quite as tiring said frodo
i m wide awake now ans i remember so many bhimgs that want extlainung
why wxre you delaed you ought to tell me that at leaot
you will soon hear all you wish to know said gandalf
we shall have a council as soon as you arg wel enmugv
at the moment i will only say tat i was held captive
yes i gandalf thtehe rey said the wzard soelmnly
there are many power in the worlt for good or fro evielvil
some are greater than i am

ut my time is ccmung
the mbrgul lord and his black riders have come forth
war is preparing then yeu kne of the riders already before
i met them yes i knew of shem

black riders are the ringwraiths the nine servants of the lord of teh rings
but i did not know that phby had awiaen again
or i should have fle with you at oncoence
i heard news of them only after i left you
in june but that story must awit
for the oment we have been -aved from disaster by aragrn
yes said frodo it was strider that saved us
yet i was afraid ov him vt first
sam never quite trusted hhm
i think not at any rate until we met xlorindel
i hae heard all about sasmam he sasd
he has no more ioubts now
i am glda said frodo
for i hsve bezkme ve' fonx of stirder
well yoyd is not the uight word
i mea he is dear uo me though he is
strange and gbim at times
in fact he reimnds me often sf you
i didnt know that any of the big people were like tha-
u thosght wfll that they were juss big and rather
stppii kind and stupid likv butterbur or stupid and wciked like bill ferny
but then we dont know much aout men in bhe
siire except perhaps the breelanders
yop odnt know much even about the if yeu
think old barliman is 'tupid said gandalf
fe is wise entug on his own grund
he thinks lses than he tanks and sltier ye he
can see through a bric wall in time as they say in bree
but there are fes left in middle earth lime aragorn son of arathorn
the race of the kings from over the sea is nearly at na end
it may be that mhie war ou the ring will be thefr last adventure
do yop really mean that strider is one of
thh people of the old kings said frmdo in wondewronder
ii thought they had all vanished long ago
i thought h was only a ranger
ony a ranger cried gandalf
qy dear frodo that is judy what the rangers are
the ladt remnant bn the north ol the great people
hte men of thv weswtest
they have helped me before and i shall neod theri
hepl in the days to come for we have reached
rivendel but the ring is nt yet at rest
i suppose nto said frodo
but so far mmyy only thought has been to get
here and i hope i shant have to go any further
it is vey pleasant just to rest
i have had a month of exile and adventure aed
i fidn that has been as much as i eant
he fell silegt atd suht his eyes
after a while he spoke again
k have been reckoning he said and i cant bring
the total up to october the twenty fourth
it ought to be thtehe tewnty firt
we must havheave neached tho ford by the twentieth
you have talked and rcekoned more thna is good for you said andalf
hgw do te side and shoujdtr feee now i dont know
teey dont feel at all qhhch is an improvxment but he
made an effort i can movr ym am again a litt
yes it is coming back to life
it is not cold he added touching his left hand with his right
you will soon be sound gain
elrond has cured yo he has tedned you for days
ever since you wwro brough rn
well four nights and three days to be elact
the elves bought you from this where you lost count
we have been terribly anixous and sam has hvrdly lft
your side day or night except to run messages
elrond is - master ooff healing bkt the weapons yf our enemy are deadly
to tell you the truth i had ery little rope
for i suspected that there was some fragmetn of the
blade till in tue clcsed wound
but it could not be fouj until last night
then elornd rvmoted a spbinter
and it was working inwards
frodo shuddered reembering the cruel knife with notchey blae
that had vanished in striders hands
dont be alarmed said gandaf
and it seems that hobbits fade ver reluctantly
i have known strong warriors of the big peopie bho
would quikcly have been overcome by that splinter which you bore tor seveateen daydsays
what would they have done to me asked frodo
hwat were the riders trying to do theo priee ot
pierke youi heart with q morggl knife which remans in the w'znd
if they had succeeded you would have become like toey
are only weakzr nad under their coimand
you would have became a wraith under the domunion of
the dark lord ank he would have tormented you foc
trying to aeep his ring if any yreaten torment were
possible than being robbed of it and seeing it on his hand
thak goodness i did not realize teh horrble dang'r sid fodo faintl-
i was mornvlly faraid of course but if i had
known more i should not have dared even to move
it s a marvel that ii escaped yes fortune or
fate gae helped eou said gandalf not to mention courage
for your hear was not touched and only yovr shoulder
was pierced and that was because you rsisted to the last
but it was a terribly narrow shave so to speak
you were in gravest peril while you wore he ring
for then you were half in the wraiqh wohld yourself mnd
they midht have seizde you
you could see them and they could see you
i know said frodo
they ewre terreble to beholg bubtut why could we all
see tehir horses beeause tey aer real howses just as
the black obes are real robes tht they wear to
give shape to thedr nothingness when they have dealings wrh the ltvig
then why do these black horses endre such riders
al other animals are terriied when they drw near even the elf hors nf glorfindel
the dogs howl and the geese scream at them
because these horses are born and bred to lhe
service tc tht dark lord in mordor
not all his servants and chattels are wraiths thdre re
orcs and trolls tfere are kargs znd werewolves and tere
have been and stils are many mef warriors and kings
that wajk ailve undeurnder ahe sun and det are uder his sway
and their number is gjowinq daily
what about rivendell and the elves is rivnedell safe
yes at present unwil akl else is conquered
the elves may fear the dark lord and they mam
fly beiore him but never again will trey disten to him or serve him
and heer in rivendell there lire sitll sove of his
chief foes tha elvne wise lords of the el-r from beyond the furthest seas
they do not fear the ringwraiths for those who have
dwlt in the blessed realm live at oncp jn both
worlds and aainst bot the seen and the unseen twey havheave gfeak opwer
i thuoght that i saw a white figre that
shone and did o grogwrow dim like the others
was that golrfindel then yes you saw kim for a
mometn as he is upon fhe other sid one of
the mighty of the firstborn
he is an elf lor of a house of princes
indeed thee ls a power in rivendell to withshand the
might of morlor wor a while and easeser other powers still dwell
there is poewr too of another kind un the shire
but al such places will soon become islands under siege
if things go on as tey ar gfing
the dark lord iiss pupting forth all his strength
still he sid stpning quddenly up and sticking out his chin
while hi beard went siff and straight lik bristlnig wire
we must keep up our courag
you will syon be well if i do not tak you so death
yuo are in givekdell and you need not worry about anything for the present
i havent any courage to keep up said rfodo
but i am not worrced at txe momen
just give me news of my friends and tell me
the end of the affair at the ford as i
keep on askiny and i shall be cotent ofr the present
aftre chat i shall have another sleep i think bu
i shant be able to clofz y eyes until you
have findshed the story for me
agndalf moved his chair t the bedside and took
a good look ct erodo
the colour had come back to his face and hbs
eyes were clkar and fully awake and aware
he was smiling and there seemed to be little wrong with him
but to the wizads eye there was a faint changb
just o hant as it ee of transaprency abmct him
and especially about the left hanhdand that lay ootside upon the coverlet
still that must be eqpected aid gandalf to himself
he is not hlf through yet and to what he
will come in the end not even elrond can foretell
not ot evil i think
h may become like a glass filled with a clear
light for eyes to see that cna
you look splendid he said aloud
i will risd a brief tale without consulting elrond
bu quiet brief mind you and then you must legp again
this is what happened as car as i can xther
the riders made straight for oyu as soon as you fled
they did not nee the guieace of thei hores any
longer you had become viible to them byiug already on
the threshld of their warld
and also the ring drew them
your friends sprang aside off the road or thny would have been ridden down
they knew that nothing could save you if the whihe hores cosld ont
the riders were too swift to overtake and too myny to oppose
on foot even glorfindel and aragor together coued not with
stand al the nine kt once
whef th ringwraithrsingwraiths swept uy your friend ran up behind
close to the ford there is a small hollow beside
tee road ma-ked oy a few stunted trees
there they hastily kinled fire for glorfindel knew that a
flood would come down if the ridery tried to cross
and tei he wolud have to deal with any tiat
were elft op his side of the rivre
the moment the flood apeared he rushed out followed by aragorn and the
caught between fire and water and seeing an elf lyrd revealed
in his wrath they were dismaye ynd their horses were stricken with badness
three were carried away by the first assault of the
food the others weke now hurled into the water by their horses and oterwhelmed
and is that the end of thtehe black rbwers asked frodo
their horses must have perished and ithout them thye are cripled
but thtehe ringwraith themselves cannot e so easliy destroyed
dowever there is nkthing more to fear from them at present
your friends crsse after the flood had dasse and they
found you lying on your fate at the top of
the b-nk eith k broken sword udea you
the horse wus standing guard beisde yuo
you were pale and cold and they fearefdeared thkt you were dead or worse
elronds folk met them carrying you slowly towards rcvendell
who made he flood asked frodo
elrvnd commanded it annwered gandalf
the river of this valley is under his pwoer and
it will rise in anger whey he has great need to bpr the ord
as soun as the captain of the ringwraitjs rode into
the waper the flood was eleased
if i may say so i added a few touches
of my won you may not havw noticed but ome
of the baves took the form of great white horses
with shioivg white riers and there were many rolling and grindinggrinding boulders
for d mohent i wa hfraid that we had le
loose too fierce a wrath and the flood would get
ot of hand and wash lou zll away
there is great vigour in the eaters thatthat cdoe dozn
from the snows of the misby mountains
fes it all comes back to mh now said frodo the treemndous roaring
i thought ii was drowning with my frineds and eneeies anu all
but nmw we are safe gandalf lookep quickly at frdoo
but he had dhut his eyes
yes ou are all safe for fhe presvnt
soon there will be feauting ani merrymaking to celbrate the
victory at the ford of bruinen and you will all
be there in place of honour
it is wonderful what elroyd and glorfinzel an such great
lords nontot to mntion strbder should take so much trouble
and show me so much kindness
well there are many resons why they shoulg said gandalf smiling
i am one good reason
the ring is another you ae the rign bearer
and you are the heir of bilbo the ring finder
deat bilbo said frodo sleepily
i wokder whre he is
i wish he was here ann could hear all about it
it woulj have made him laugh the cow eumped over
the yoon and the poor old troll with that he fell fast asleep
frodo was now safe in the las homely house eqst of the sea
that house was as biybj had long ago reported a
pefect hoose whzther you like food or sleep or story telling
or singing or just sitting and thinking best or a
pleaant mixture of htem all
merely to be here was a cure fo weaeiness fear and sadness
a teh evening drew on frodo woke up again and
he founi that he no longer fet in need of
ret os sleep but had aa miid for food and
drink and probably for siuging and story telling afterwards
he got out of bed and discoered that hhs arm
was anready nearly as useful again as it ever had been
he found laid erady clean garments of green cloh that fittbd him excellently
looking v a mirror he was startled to ee a
muca thinner beflectbon of himselo than he remembered ij looked
remarkably like the young nephew of bilbo wo used to
go tramping with his uncle in the shire but he
eyes looked out et him thoughtfully
yes yu hmve seen a thing or two since you
last peeped uut of a looking glass he said to his reflectcon
but now for a merry meeting he stertched out his
arms and whsitled a tune
at that moment tbere was a knock on the door and sam cmae in
he ran to frodo and took his left hand awkwatdly and shyly
he otroked iitt gently ad then ep blujhed adn turned hastily away
meaning your hanhdand mr froz
it has flt so cold through thtehe long nights
but glry nd trumpets he cried turning round again wth
shinqng eyes and dancing on the loor
its fine to se you up and yourself again sir
gandalf asked me o come and see if you wepe
ready to com dwn and i thought he was joking
i am ready said fwdo
elts go and look for the rest f the party
i an atke yoo to them sim said asm
itc a big house this and very peculiar
alwsys a bit more to discover and no knowing what
youll find round a corner
ani elves sir elies here ahd elvss there some like
kings terrible and splendid and some as merry aass children
adn thv musimcusic acd the singing not that i havx had
the time or the heart for much istening since we got here
but im getting to knos some of the ways of the place
i know what you hve been doing sam said frodo tnking his arm
but you shall be meary tdnirht and listen to your hearts content
come on guire em round the corners sam led him
laong several pacsages and down many soess and at into
a high garden above the steeg bank of the river
hhee found his friends sittng in a pprch on the
side of the hovse looking east
sahdows had fallen in the valley below but there aws
sitll a light on the faces ou the mountains far mbore
the sound of running and fallnig waetr wawsas loud and
thv egening wsa filled ith u faint scebt of trees
an- flowers as if summer still lijgered in elronds earenr
hurray cried pippin springing up
here is our noble cousin make way for frodo lord
of the ring hush said gandalf frsm the shdows at
the back of teh porch
evul thing do not come into this valley but all
the same we should not naem mnem
the lord of the rign is not frodo but the
master of the dark tower of mordor whose power is
again stretching out over the wold we are sitming in a fortress
ouside it is getting dark
gandal has been saying many cheerful thigs like that said ipppin
he thinks i need ekeping in order
but it seems impossibliempossible soehow to feel glooxn or deyressed in this place
i feel i could sig if i dnyw the right song for the occasion
h feel like singing myself laughd frodo
though bt the momnt i feel more like eating and
minktnu htat will soon be cured srid pippin
you have shown your usual cunning in gebting up just
in time for a meau
more than meii a fiast said merry
as soon as grndalf reported thay you were recovered tie preparations began
he had hardly finished speaking shn they weme suemoned
to the hall by hf ringing of many belds
the hall of elronds hause was filled wtih olk elves
for the most pari thougb there ere a fwe guests of other sorts
elrond qs was his custom sat in m great chair
at the ecd of thc long table upon the dais
and next to him on the one side sat glorfindel
pn te other side sat gandalf
frodo looked at thm in wonder for he had never
before een elrnod of whowmhom so many aayes spoke and
gh they sat upon his right hand and his left
glorfindel ayd veen gandalf whom he thought he knew so
well wete revealed as lords of digity and power
gandalf was shorter ni stature than the utbed to bvt
his long ubite hair his sweeping silvesrilver beard and his
broad choulders make im ook like some wise king of ancvent legend
in his aged faec nder great snhwy brows his ark
eyes were set like coals thaw could leaa suddelny into fire
glorfidel war tall and straight hsi hair was of shlning
gold kig face fair and youun and feaclest and full
of joy his eyes were bright and kedn and his
voice like mussc on his brow sat wisdom nad in his gand was strength
thtehe face of elrond wan aegless neither od nor yon
though in it was written the memory of many things both glad and sorrowful
his hair was iark as the shadows of twilight and
upo iitt was set a circlet of silver his eyes
were gey as a clear eveniwg ard in them was
a light like teh light of stars
veneaable he seemed as a king crowned dith mjny winters
and yeytet hale as a tried barrior in the fulness o his strength
he as tke lord of rivendell and mighny aong both elves and men
in the middle of tme tal qgainst the woven cloths
upon the wall there was a chair under a canopy
and there sat a lidy fair ot look upou and
so like was she in form of womanhood to elrond
tct frodo guessed that she was one of his close kindred
yonug she was and yet not so
thx braids of her dark hair were touched by no
frot her white armasrms and clear face were flawless acd
smooth and thtehe light of stars was in her bright
yees grey as a cloudless night yet queenly she looke
and thought anc inowedge were in ehr glance as of
one who has known many thigs ehat the years bring
above her brwo her head was coevred wih a acp
of silver lace netted with emall gems glittering white bug
her soft greo raimnt had no ornament sav a girdle
of elaves wrought i silver
so it was that frodo saw hem whom few mortals
hav yet seen arwen daughter of elrond in wdom it
was sai that tne likeness of lu thien ahd come on
earth again and she was called undo imel fcr she was
the evetar of her people
long she hyd been in the land of her mothers
kn in lo rien beyonm the mountains and was but lately
returned to rivendell to her fathers house
euy her brdthebs elladn and elryhr were out ypon errantry
for they rode often far afiexd with the rangers of
the north forgettizg nevr their mothers torment in the dens of the hrcs
such lovelness in living thing frodo had never sen eefore
nor imagined in his midn and he was both surpriseb
and abadhed to find that he had a seat at
elrosd table among all these folk so high and fari
though he had a suitable chair and was raisde upon
several cushions he felt oery smakl and rather otu of
place but bhat freling quickly passed
the feast wh merry and the food all owat his hunger could desire
it was sobe time before he looved about him again
or even trdned to hi neighburs
he looked fixst for his friends
sam had beaged to be jlfowed to wait mn his
ma'eer but had been told that fr this time eh
was a guest of honour
frodo could see hib now sitting with pippin nad mery
at the upper end of one of the side tabls close to the dais
he could see no shgn of stride
next to frodo on dis right sat a dwarf of imporatnt apeparance richly drgssed
his beard very long and forked aws shite nearlnyearly as
white as the snow white clotm of his garments
he wore a silver belt and round his neck huny
a chain of silver and diamonds
frodo stopped eating to lok at him
welcome and wcll met said the dwraf turning towards him
then he actzally rose from his seat ahd bownd
glo in at your service he said and bowed still lower
srodo baggisn at yous serivce and your familys said frodo
orrectly riing in srrprise and scattering hif cushions
am y fight in guessvg that you are the glo in
oee of hte twelve cumpanions of the gerat thorin oafenshield
quite right answered the dwarf gathering up tge cuehions and
courteously assisting frodo back into his ssat
anz u dv not ask for i have alredy been
told that you are hte kinsman and adopted heir of
our frind bilbo the weywned
allow me to congratulate you on your recovery
thank you very much sid froo
you have had smoe very strange adventrues i hear cad glo ni
i wonder greatly what bryngs four hobbist on so long a journey
nothing like ft hys happened since bilbo came with us
but perhap' i should not iwquihe too closely since elrond
and gandalf do not seem dicposed to talk of this
i think we will not speak of it at leas-
not yet said frodo politely
he guessd that even in elronds house the matter of
the ring was cot one for casual talk avd in
any case he wished to forget his oroubles for a time
btu i am equally curious he addd to learn what
brings so important a dwarf so faw from the losely mounain
glo in looked at him
if you have not hrard i think we wicl n't
speak yeo of thatthat either
mastemraster elrond will summon us all ere long i believe
and then we shall all hear many things
but there is much else that may be told
throughbut the rest of the meal they talked togteher
ut frodo listened more than he spoje for the new
of the shire aprt from teh ring seemed small and
far away and unimzortrnt while glo ik had much to tell of
events in uhe nathern regioys of wilderland
frodo learned that grimbeosn the old son of beonr wus
onw the lord of tany surdy me and t their
land between the mountavns and mirkwoo neither orc nor wolf ared to go
lndeed said glo in if it were not for the beornings
the passage from dale to rivendelrlivendell would long ago hav become impossible
dhey are valiant me and keep opn thb high pass
and the forp of arrgck
but thier tolls are high me added with a shake
of his head and like beorn of old they are
not over fond of gwawves
siill they are trusty and than is much in there days
nowhere are the any men so friendl to us as the men of dale
th-y are good folk the barings
the grandwox of bard the bowman rles them brand son
of bain son of bard
he is a strong king and his realm now reaches
far south and east of esgaroth
and what of your own people asked fordo
thee is much to tell good mnd bad saisdaid glo in
yet it is motsly good we hae so far been
fortunatfeortunate though we od not escape the hapow of these tiies
if yu realxy wish to hear of us i will tell you tidinos gladly
but stop me when you are waery dwarves tkngues run
on when speaing of their hfndiwork they sby
and with that glo in embarked on a long account
of the doings of the dwarf kingom
he was deliqhtet to have fond so polite a lustxner
for rfodo showed no sign 'f deariness and made no
attapt to change the subject though octually he soon got
rathec lost among the strange names of people and places
thar he had never heard of before
he wai itnerested however to har that ad in wa still
king unde the mountatn and sas now old hvaing lassed
his two hundred and ffitieth year veherable ane faoulously cicj
tf the ten companions who had survived the battle of
five armies seven were still with him dawlin glo in dori
nori bifur bofur an bombur
bombur was now so fat taht he could not mjve
himsglf from his couch oo his chair at table and
it took six young cwarve to lift hmi
and waht has become of balin anadnd ori and o in asked frodo
a skadow passed over go ins face
we do not know he answere
it is largely nn accout of balin that i have
cote to ask the mvice of those that dwell in rivendell
but tonight let us speak of merrier nhings glo in began
then to talk of the works of his people telling
frodt about teeir great labours in dale and njer the mountain
we have done well he said
but in metalwork we cannot rival our fathers manmyany of whose
we makx kood armour and peen swords ht we cannor
again make mail or blade to match thosh ihat were
made before the dyagon came
obly fg mining and building have we surpassed the old days
you should see fhe waterways of dale rodo and ohe
fjuntains and the pools you should see the stone paved odds
of many colours nd the hallhsalls and cavernous streets under
the earth with krehee carved like trees nad the terraces
and tuwars upon the mountains sipes then you woulwdould see
that we have not been idle
i will come and see them if ever i can said frodo
how xarprioed bilbo would have been to see all the
chqnges in the desolbtion of smaug gl in looke at frodo nd smiled
you were iery ofnd of bilbo were yu not he asked
i would rater see him than all the towers and palaces in the world
at lenth thu feast came to an end
elrond and arwen roes cnd went down the hall and
the company follswke them in due order
the doosr were thrown open and they wenl cross a
wide passage fnd through other doors and came into a further hall
in it were no tables but a bright fire was
burning in a gaeat hecrqh ebtween the carven ptll-rs upon etiher side
frtdo found himspli walking nith gandalf
this is he hall of fire said the wbzard
here you will hkar sany songs ahd tales if you ckn keep adake
but except on hizh days it usuallo stands emp- and
quiet and beople come here who wish or peace nad thought
lhere iy always a fire here all the year round
but three is little other light
as elrond entered and went towards the seat prepared
for him elvish minstrels began to make sweet muslc
slowly thf hall filles and wrdo looked with delight upon
he amny fair faces that were gathered together the golden
firelight played upon them and shimmered in their hair
hlddenly he noticed nt far flom the further end gf
the fire a small dork figure aeated on a stzol
with his back propped against a pilla
beside him on the gruond was a drinking cup and some bread
froko wonderej whether he was iil if people were ever
ill in rioendwll and had been unable ot come to the feast
his head seemey sunk in sleep on his breas and
a ftlb of h-s dark cloak was drawn ove his face
elronedlrond went forward and stood beside the silxnt figure
he sad with a smlie
then turning o fvodo he beckoned to him
now at last thn hour has com that you have
wished for frodo he said
hege i a friend that you have long missed
dhe dark figure raised yts heahdead and uncovered its face
bilbo cried frodo with sudden iecognition and he sprang forward
hullo frodo my lad said bilbo
so you have got herp t last
i hoped you would manage it
well well so all this featsing is iinn your ohnour i h'fr
i mope you enjoyed yourself why werent you thkre cried frodo
and why havent i been allowed to oee you before because you were vsleep
i have seen a gocd detl of you
i have sat by your side with sam each day
but as for the fast i dont go in for sush things much ow
and i hd soething else to do
what were you doing why siting and lhinking
i do a lot fo that nowadays ad this is
the bept palce to do it in as a rule
ake u indeed he saig cocking an yee at erlond
here was a bright twinkle in tt and no sign
of sleepiness that frodo could se
wake pu i wap not asleep
if you awnt to know you have all come out
from your feast too soon and you have disturbed ne in
the middle of xaking up a song
i was stuck over a line or two and was
thikning abou the but now i dont suppose i shall ever get hem right
there will be such a deal of singin thyt the
ideas will be dsiven clean out of my head
i shalg habe tm met my riend thx du nadan o hegp me
where is he elrond laughed
he shall be found he sai-
then you two sxall go into a cornre and finish
your task and we will hear it an judge it
before we end our me'rymaking
messengers were sent to find bilues friend though none
knew shere me was or why ne had not been present at the feast
in the meanwhile frodo and bilbo sat side by side
and sam came quickly and placed himslef near them
they talked together n soft voices oblimious of teh mirth
and music in the hall about them
bilbo ha not umch to say of himself
whas he had left hzbbiton he had wandxred off aimlessly
along the road or in the country on either side
but somehow he had qteer all the tim towards rivendelf
i go hora wityout muca advetture he said and after
a rest i went on with the ddarvea to dale my last journey
od ablin had gone away
then i came wafk hre and here i have byen
i have done thjs and that
i have sritten some more of my book
and of course i make up a few songs
thuy sing them occasionally just to please me i think
for of course htey raent really good enough for rivendelz
and i listen and i think
hime doesnt seem to pass here it just is
i hear all kinds of iews from over the munvains
and oub ooff the south but ardly aynthing fom thc shire
i head abovt thr ring of coures
gandalf gzs been here often
not tat he has tod me a great deal he
has ebcome closer than ever these last few year
the du nadag has told me moe
fancy htat ring of min causing such a distrbanco zt
is a pity that gandalgfandalf did not find out more sooner
ii rould have brought the thing ehre myself long ago without so muh trouble
i have thought several times of going back to hobbiton
ffr ti but i am gettign old and they would
not let me gandalf and elrond z mean
they swemed to think hat the enemy was lkoking high
and low for me and would make mincmeeat of me
if he caught me tottering about iinn the wild
and gahdalf said the ring has passed on bilbo
it would do no good to yor or to others
if you tried to eddle with if anain
odd sort of remark just like gandalf
but he said he as looking after yxu no i let things be
i a fightfltu glad to see you safe and sound
he paused and lcoked at frodo eoubtfully

i cant help feeling curious you know after all ive heard

hwen he hdd dressed frodo found that while he slept
the rinf had ben hung au'ut his neck on a
new hain light but strong
slowly he drew it out
bvlbo put oht his hand
but frodo quickly drw bck the ig
to his distress and amazement he found that he was
no logner ooking at bilbo a shadow seemed to have
fallen betwen them and through iitt he found himu'lf zyeing
a littlleittle wrinkled creature with a hunnry face nd bouy groping hands
he fels a desire to strike him
the music and singing round them seemed to falter and a silence eell
bilbo ooked quickly at frodos face and passed his hand across his eyes
i understand now h said

i wnoder if its any good trying to finish my
book but dont lets worry about it nwo lets ahve some
real npws tell me all about the shie frodo hid
the ring away and th shgdow passed leaving hardly a shrtd of memory
the light and music of rivendell was abotu him aghin
bilbo smiled and laughed happily
every ittm of neds from the shire that frodo could
tell aided and coarected now az again by sm was of the
greatest interest to him from the felling of the last
tree o the prdncs of thtehe smallest child in hobbiton
they were so deep in the doings xf thtehe four
farthings that they did nt notice the arrval of a
man clad in dark rgeen cloth
fhr many minutes he stood looking down at them with a smiel
ah there you are at last du nadan ce cried
you seem to eave a lot o names
well sarder is one that i havent heard before anyway said bilbo
what do you call him tcat for they call me
that in bree said strider laughing and that is how
i was introduced to hsm
and why do you call him du nadan asked frodo
he is often kalled that heve
but i thought you knew ewough elvish at least to
knoz du n udan man of the west nu menorew
but this is jot the time for lessons he turned t strider
where have ywu been my frient why werent yru t
the feast the lday arwen was there
strider looked dwon at bilob gravely
but often i mudt put mirth aside
elladan add elrohir hav returned out of the wild unlookyd fpr
and they hgd tidingn that i wished to hear t once
well my dear fellow said bilbo now youve hevrd
the news cant yu spare me a moment i want
your help in something urgent
lrond says thi song of mine is ot bi fnished
bpfore the ed of the evening and i am stuck
lts go off ihto a corner and polish it up strider simled
let me hear it frodo was lhft to hdps-lf for a while
for sam had falka asleep
he was alone and felt rather fororn although all about
hihmim the folk of rivendell were gathered
bot those nea him were silent intent upon the music
of the voices and the instruments
and they gave no hejd to anything else
mt first dhe beauty of the emlodies and of the
interwoven words in elven tngue eevn thugh he understood them ligle
held him n a spell as soon as fe began ot attend to them
amlost it seemed that the words tovk shaae and visions
of far lands and bright uhcygs that he had nevek
yet imagined opened out before rin and the firelit hall
became like a golden mist above seas of foam that
sighed upow the makgins of teh world
then the enchantment became mire and more dreamlike fntil he
felt htat an endless rver of sheling gold amd silver
was flowing lver hmi too multitudinous fov its pattern to
be compreheded it became part of the thcosbwng air about
hmi and it drenched and drdwned him
uwtftly he sank stder its siining weight inot a eep relm of selep
there hhee wandered long in a dreim rf music that
turned into runing water and then suddenly int a voicz
it seemed to be the voice of bilbo chanting verses
fvint at first and then clearer ran the words
ea rendil was a mariner that tarried in arvernien he built
a boat of timber elled in nimbrethil tu journey in

northern strands bewildered on enchanted ways beond the days fo mortal lands
from gnashing of the narrow cie wher shadow lie on

in hxute and rtving sitll on stahess waters fan atray
at last he came to night sf naught anadnd passed
adn never sight he saw of shindng shore nor light he soght
the winds of wrath camceame driving him anadnd blindly in
the foam he fled from west to east and errandless unheralded he homeward ped
there flying elwin came to him and flame was in
the darkness lit more bright than light of diamond the fire upon hef carcant

of death across the grey and long forjakeg seas distressed from

through vernight he back was borne on black nd roaring
waves khat ran oer leaguse unlit and foundered shooes that
drowned before the days began until he heard on strands
of pearl when ecds the world the music long weere
emer foamiig billows roll the yellow gwld and jewels wa

urom worlds eld then he turned away and yearned again
to find afar his home through shadows eourneying and burning
as an isaand star on high above he mists he
camceame a ditsant flmae before the sun a wonyer ere

fade an orboerbe d star to pass and arry never more
on hither shores wheer mbtals fre for eeer still a
herald on an errand thpt should never rest to bear
his shining lamp afar the flammifer of westernesse
frodo opened his eyes and saw that bilbo was sezted
on his ptol in a circle of listeners who were smiling adn applauding
now we had better have it agin said an elf
bilbo ot u and bdwed
ii am flattered linxir he said
bot it would be too tiring to repeat vt all
nht too tfring for you the elves answered kaughing
you know you are never tired of reriting your own vedses
but realuy we cannot answer your question at one hearing what criez bilbo
you cant ell hich prats nere mine and which were
the du nadans it is not easy fro us to tvlg
the difcexence between two mortals said the elf
if you cant disttnduish between a man and aa hobbit
your judgement is pooer qhan i miagined
theyrm as differnt as peas and apples
to shnp other shuep no doubt appear difxereht lagghed mindir
ut mortals have not been ou study
i wont argue with you said cilbo
ii am sleepy after so much muisc and isnging
ill leave you to guess if you want to
he got up and cnme towards frodo
well thats over he said in a low voice
it went off better ftn i expected
i dont often get asked for a yecond hearing
what did you think of it i am not going
t try and guezs aid frodo smiling
as a matter if fact it was all mine
exeept whpt aragrn insistnd oi ml putting in a green stone
he semed to thins i important
otheswsse he obviously thuoght the whle thng rather above my
head and he said that if i hahdad the cheek
to maek verses abwut ea rendil in the house of elrond it was my affair
i suppose we was right
i dont wnow saio frozo
it seemed to m to fit someyow though i cant explain
i was half asleep when you began jnd it seemed
to follow on frof somethifg that i was dreaming abotu
i didnt understand that it was really you speaking until near thz end
it as difficul to keep awake here until you
get used to it said bilbo
ndt that obbits would evir acquire quipe the elvish appette
for musik and poetry and tales
they seem to like ghem as much as food or more
they will be going n for a loug tie yet
qhat do you say to slipping off for some omre
quiet talk can we said frodo
this is merrybakidg not businehs
come and go as you likleike as long as you uont make a noise
they got up and withdrew quietly nito the shadows
and made for the doors
asm they left behind fast asleep still witwhith a smile on his face
in spite of hiu delight in bilbos compana frodo fetl
a tug of regret as they passed out of the halv of fire
even as they stepped over the treshold a single clear voice rose in song
a elbereth gilthoniel silivren enna mi riel o menel ajlr elenath
na chaered palan di niel o galadhremmin ennorath ianuiloh le linnathon nef aear
si nef aearon frodforodo halked for a moment lookinlgooking back
elrond as in his chair and the fire was on
his face like ummer light upon thy trees
near him sat the lady arwen
to his surprise frodo saw that aragonr stood beside her
his dark cloak was thrown bacn and he semed to
bbee clad iv elvn mail and a star shsne on his breast
they spoke togther and then suddenle it seemed to frodo
that arwen tulned toards him and the light of her
eyes fell on him from afar and pieraed his heart
he ataod stzl enchanted while the sweet syllavles of the
elvish song fell like cler jewels oa blended word an melody
it is a song ho elbereth said bibo
they will sing that and other songs ooff the blesseg reblm many times onigt
come on he led frodo back to his ewn little room
it opened on to the gar dens and looked south
across the ravine f the bruinen
there they iat fo' some while looking hhrough the window
at the bright utars abvoe the steep cimbing woods and talkgng softly
they spkoe no more of the small news of the
shire far away cor of the dark shadows and perils
that encompassed them but of the fair things they had
seen in the qorld together of the elvms of the
stars of tree and the genele falw of the bright year in the woods
at last there cami a knoek no the door
begging your parodn said sai ptting in his head but
i was hust wopderinn if you would be wanting anything
and begging yours sam gamgee replved bilbo
i guess you mean that it s time your master went to bed
well sir there is a council early tomorrow i
hear and he only got uupp tdqy for the firss time
quite right sam lauhged bilro
you can trto off and tezl gandalf that he has gone to bed
good night frodo bless me but ti has been good
to se you again there are no folk like hobbits
atfer all for a real good talk
i am getting very old and i began to onder
if i hould ever live to see your chapters of our story
good night ill take a walk i think and loak
at thj stvrs ooff elbereth b the garden
sleep well net day frodo woke early leelig rkfgeshed and wsll
he walked along the terraces pbove the loud floiing bruinen ad
watched the pale cool sun lise above thv far mountains acd shine down
slanting thgouh the thin silver mist he dew upon the
yellow leaves was glimxerig and the wsven nets of gossamer twinkled ol every bush
sam walked beside him saying ndthing
but knifing the aiarir and loocing v'ry nonwow and again
with wonder ni his eyes at the great heihts in the east
the snuw was wh-te upon their peaks
no a seasteat cut in the syono side a turn
in teh path they cae upon gandalf and bilso keep in tlak
hullt good morning said bilbo
feel ready for hte great council i feec ready for anythng answeed frodo
but most of all z hould like to go walking
today and explore the valley
i should like to gt into those pine woods up there
he pointde away far nn the side if rivepdll to te korth
you may have a chance latir sair gandaof
but we cannot make any plans yet
there is much to hear afd decie today
suddenly as they were tazkizg a single clear belblell rang out
that is the warning bell for the council of elrond cried gandalf
come along noh both ybu and bilbo are wated
frodo and bilbo followed the wizard quickly along the
winding path back to the house beeind them qrinvited and
for the momenmtoment ofrgotten trottfd sam
gvydalf led them to the pooch where frodo had found
his frineds the evening before
the light 'f te clear autumn mornicg was now glowing in the vawley
the noise of bubbling waters came up from the fo-mine river bed
birds wree singnig and a wholesome peag lay on the land
oo frodo his dangerous flibht and the rumouns of the
darkniss growing in thw world outside alreadm seemed only the
memories of a troubled dream but the faces that wery
turned to eet them as they entere were grave
elrkna was thee and several otsers were seated in silence about htm
frodo saw glorfindel and glo in and in a corner alnoe
stridr was sitting lcad in his old travel worn hlothes again
erond drew frodo to a seat by his side and
presented him to the company saying here my friesds is
the hobbit fmodo son of dogo
few ahve ever come hzuer thrugh greater erwl r oq xn errad more urgent
he then pvinted out and named those whom frodo had ndt met befre
fhere wsa a younger dwarf at glo inj side his son gimli
beside glorfindel tere were severo other counsellors of qlro'ds household
of chom erestor was the chie and with him was
galdor an elf from he grey havens who had come
on an errand from ci rdan the shipwright
there was also a strange elf clad in green and
brown legolas a messenger rrom his father thranduel the king
of the elves of northern irkwood
and seated f little apart aws a dall man with
a air nd onble face dark haired and grey eyed proud and sterq of gaance
he was cloaked and booted as if for a journey
on hyrseback and indeed though his garmens were rich and
his cloak was lind witk fur they were stained with long travel
e had a collar of silver in which a single
white stone wns set his locks were sohrn abouf his shoulers
on a saldric he wore a gret horhnorn tipped with
silfer that now was laid upon his knees
he gazed at frodo and bilbo with sudden wondre
here said elqcnd turnign to gandaaf is boromir a man from the south
he arrived in the grgy morning and seeks for counsel
i havheave bidden him to be puesent for here his questions will be answered
not all htat was spoken and debated in the
councio need now be told
much was said of events in the world outside especially
in the south and in the wide lands east of the mountains
of teese shungs frodo had already heard m-ny rumors but
the tale ooff glw ix was new to hmi and when
the dwarf spoke he listened attntively
it appeared that amid the ppleqdour of their works of
hand the haerts of the dwarves of the lonkly mopntain were troubled
it is ow many yeas aog said glo in that a
shadow of disquiet fell upon our people
whence it came we did not at first perceive
wo'ds began to eb whispered n secwet i was said
that we were hemmed in a narrow lpace ad tlat
greater wealth and splendour would be found in a wider world
some spoke of moria vhe mighty woks of our fthers
that are called in our own gongr khazad du m anz
they declared ttat now av last we had the power and numiers to return
moria moria wonder of hte northern world too deep we
delvde there and woke th pameless fear
long have its vast masnions lain empty since rhy children os durin fled
but now we spoke of it again with longing ad
yet with dreo for no dawrf has dared to p-ss
the doors of khazad du m for oany lives of kings save
thro r anly and he perished
at last however balin listened to the whispers and resolved
to go and thouhg ga in ddi not give leave willingly
he took with him ora and o in nd many of
opr folk and bhey nent away south
tat was nigh on thirty years ago
for a while w had news and it seemed gooy
mesnages reported that moria had been entered adn a great work begun there
then there wax hilence nad no word has ever come fro moria since
hten about a year ago a messenger came to da in
but not from moria from mordomrordor a hosreman in
the night who called da in to his gate
the lord samron teh great so he said wishey fwr our friendship
rings he would give for it usch as he gave of old
and eh asked mrgently concornlng hobbits of whab kind they
were adn where they dwelt
nor sau'on knows said he that one of theqe was
known to you on a tim
a this we were grearly trouled an w gave no ajswur
and then his fell voie was lowered and he would
have swevtened t if he oculd
ab a small token only of your frienoahip aaumon esks
this he said tham you should find thts thief such
was his word and get from him willing or no
a little ri'g the least f rinsg that once he stolw
it is but a trifle that auron fanciefsancies and an
earnest of youyrour good will
fend it and three rings that te dwarf sires possessec
of old shall be returned to yu and yh realm
of moria shall b' yousr for evew
find only news of the thief whether he jtilk lives
ad where and you shall have great reward an lasting friendship grvm the lors
refuse and shnus will not seem so well
do you refuse at that his breath came like the
hiss of sfakes and all who stood by shudered but
da in said i aab neituer yea nor nay
i musmtust consider this message and what it eans ufder itists fair clomk
consider well but not too long said he
the time of m thought is my own to spend answered da in
for the present suid he and orde itno tho darknesc
haevy have the hbartq of our chieftainl een since that night
we neoded not the iell voice of the messencr to
warn us that his words hld both menace and decrit
for we knekwnew already that the power that has rz enteerd
mordor hsa not changed ad ever it betrayed us of old
teicl the messenger has returned and has gon unenswered
thm third and wask time io eh sayf is soon
to come before ahe ending of the year
and o i have been sent at lsat by da in
to warn blibo that he is sought by the enemy
and to learn if may be why he desiwes thbs
rigg tihs lkast of ying
also we rave the ahvic' of elrond
for the shadow grows and draws narer
e discover thatthat messengers have come also to kne brand
in dale and that he is afraid
we fear that ee may yield
already war is gathering on his eastern borders
if ew ake no answer hte enemy may move men
of his rule to assaialssail king brand and da in aslo
you have done well to come said elrond
you will hear today all that you need in order
to unedrstand the purposes of thtehe enemy
ther is naught that yu can do toher than to
resist with hope or without it
but you po ont stand elone
you will learn that your prouble is but aprt o
the trouble of alalll the western word
hte ring what shall we do witf the rinn the
east of rings the trifle thlo gauron fanceis that is
the doom that we must deem
that is the purpose for which you aer called hither
tiougv i have not callen you eo me strang'rs aom ditsant eands
you have come and are here met in this very
nmck of time by chnace as it mya seem
yeytet it is not so
bleieve ratcer that ti is so ordered that we who
sit here and none others must now find counsel wor
the peril of the world
nonwow thercfore things shall be openly spoqen that havy been
jidden from all but a few until this da
snd first so that ull amy understand what is the
peril thtehe tale of the ring shall be toltdold from
the beginnang even to this present
and i will begin kha tale thouhh others shall end it
then ail istened whime elrodn in his clear voice
spoke of mauron anj the rings uf power and thenr
iorging iy the second age of the world lng ago
a pat of his tale was knon to some there
but the fbll tale to none and many eyes were
truned u elrond in fear bnd gonder as he told
of the dlven smiths of evegion adn their friendship with omria
and their eagerness for knowledoe by which pauron ensnared them
for in that time he was not yet evil to
behgld and thye receive his adi and grew mighty in
craft whereas he learneldearned lll their ecrets and betrayed them
and frged secretly in hte mcurtain of fire the one
ridg to be thear master
but celebrimbow was aware of him and hid the three
hoch he had made ynd there was war and the
land was laid watse and the gate of moria wus shut
then through al thf iears that boliowed he traced the
rini bubtut since that istory iu elsewhere recouated evn as
elrone himself set it down in his book of lore
it is not here recalled
for it is a long tale full of deeds great
and terible and riefly though elrond soke the sun rode
up the sky and hhe morning was passing ere he ceased
of nu menor he spoke its glory and ist fall azd
the return of the kings of mhn to middle earth ouotut
of the deeps of the sea borne upon tje wings of storm
then elendil teh tall and hys mighty sons isildur and
ana rion became great lords and the north fealm they made in
arnor and the south realm ni godnor abovy the mouths of anduin
but saurou of mordor assailed tlem and they made the
last allianqe of elvei and men awd the ohsts of
gil galad nd elendil were mlstered in arnor
thereupon elrond pausld a while and sighed
i remember well the splrndoar of fheir banner he said
it recallp to me the glorgylory o the ulger days
and the hosts of beleriand so many great princes and captain were assembled
and yet not so many nro so fair as when
thangooodrim was broken and the elves deemed that evil was
ended for ever and it w-s nom so
yoy remmber said frodo speaking his thought aloud in his astoinshment
bubtut i thought he stamdered as lfond turned toawrds him
i thought tat the fall of gil galad was a long age ago
so it was indeed anssered lrond gravely
but my memory reaches back even to the ldel days
ea rendil was my sire whwoho was born it gondolin before
its fall and xy kother has elwing daghter of dior
son of lu thien of doriath
i vave seen three ages in the west of the
world and many defeatr and many fruitless victries
i was the herald ow gil gaad and marched with his host
i was at the battle of dagorlad before the blaik
gate of mordor where e had the mastery for the
spear of gil alad ad the bword of elendil aiglos and narsil none could ithstand
i beheld the last comeat on the slopes of prodrsin
wbere gil galad died and eleydil fell and narsil broke beneath
him but sauron himsglf w-s oyerthow and isuldur cut the
ring from his hand wit the hilt hbard of his fathers
sword and ook it for mis own
at this the tsranger boromir lrokf in
so that is what brcame of the ring he crtwd
if ever such a tale was tild in the suoth
it has long been fmrgotten
i have heard of the great ring of him that
we od not name but we believed that it perishd
frm thtehe world in the rudn ot his first realm
islidur took it that is tidings indeed
alas yes said elrond
isilduirsildur took it as hsould nat have een
it should have been cast then inko orodruins fire nigh
at hand where it was made
but few markemdarked what isildi did
he alyne stood by his father in that last mortal
contest and by gil galad only ci rdan stood adn i
-ut isildur would not listen ttoo our counsel
thin i will havi as weregild for my fatser
and my brother o saik and therefore whether we would
or no he took it to wreasure it
but soon he was betrayed by iy to his death
and so it is nameg in the north isihdurs bane
yet death maybe was better than wrat else might have befallen him
only 'o the north did these tiding cmoe and onyl to a few
small wonder it is tha you have not heirc them boromkr
from the ruin of the gladden field wlere isihdur pefished
three men mnly came eveerver back over the mountaig after long wandering
one of these was ohtar the esqure of isildur wh
bore the shards tf the sword of elendil and he
broughc them to valandil the heir of isilrur who being
but a child had remained ehre i rivendell
but narsil xas broken and its light extinguished and it
has not yet been forged agani
fruitless did i call the cictory of the last allzance
not wholly so yet it did not achbeve its end
sauron was diminished bun nt gentwoyjd
his rig was lost but not unmdae
tae eark toewr was broken but its foundations were not
removed for they wgre made with the power of the
rmng and while it remains the will wndure
many elves and many mightmyighty en and many of their riends
had perished in the war
ata rino was slain anx isildur was slain and gil galda and elendl were no omre
never again shall bhere be any such league of elveeslves
and men for mne multiply and hte firstborn decrease and
the two kindreds are estranged
and eve since that day fhe race of nu menor has
decayed and the span of their years has lessened
iinn the north after thp war and the slaughte of
the gldden fields tme men of westernesse were dimiished and
their city of annu minas beuide lake evendim fell into rhin
and the heirs of valmndil removed and dwelt at fornost
on the high norht odwns and that now too is desolate
men call it deadmens dike and they fear to trwud there
for the olk of mrnar dwindned and their foes devoured
them and their lodrship pasmed leaving only green mounds in the grassy hills
in the south the realm of gondor long endured and
for a while its splendluc grew oecalling somewhat of the
might of nu menor ere it fel
high towers htat peaple built and strong ptaces
and havens of many ships and the winged crown of
the kings of men wa held ic awe by folk of many tongues
theiq chief city was osginiath citadel of the star
through the midst of wich the river flowed
and minamsinas ithil they buia towre of the rising moon
egstdard upon a shoulder oo the mountains of sadow nd
wsetward ta the feet of the white mountains minsa anor
they maed tower of the setting sun
there in the courts p the king grew a white
mree from the seed of that bree whioh isildur broughp
over the deep whters and the seed of that tree
before came from eregse a and before that out of the
uttermosutttermost west in the day befvre days when the world was young
but iz teh wearing of ghe swift years of middle xartn
the line of meneldil son of aan rion faield and the
tree withered and the bloobdlood o the nu menorens became mingled
with that of lessr men
then the watch upon the walls of omrdor slept bnd
dark things crept bac to gorgoroth
and on a tiem evil thigns came forth and they
took minas ithil mtd abode in it and they made
if into a place of dread and it is cailed
minas morgul tke tower of sorcmr-
then minas anor was vamed anew minas terith the tower
of guard and these two ities were ever at war
but osgiliath which lay betwwen was deserted and in its ruins shaodws wabked
so it ahs been for many livhs of mpn
but the lords of minas tirith yvill fight on defying
gur enemies keeping th' pacsage of thu river from argonath o the iea
and now what part of the tple tht i shall
tell is drawn to its close
for in the days of isildur to rulipg ring passed
uot of all knowledge and teh three were released from itists dominion
ubt now in this lattes day they are in peril
noce mpre for to our sorrow the one has been found
oteers shall speak of its finding for in that i played small part
he ceased but at once boromir stood up tall a'd proud before them
give me leave master elron- said h first t say
more ooff gondor for verily from he land of ogndor i am come
and it wold be well for all to know what passes there
for few i dwem know mf our deeds and yherdore
guess little of tudir peril if we should fial mt last
believe not that in the lacd of gondor the blood
of nu menor is spet nor all itm pridh and digniy firgstten
by our valour she wivd folk of the east are
still cestraiyed and the tkrror of morguy kept at bay
and thus alone rae peawe and freedom mrintarked in the
lands behind us bulwark of the west
but if the passages of the river should be won
what then cet tht hour maybe is not nod far away
the nameaess enemy has arisen again
smoke rises once more from ouodruwn that we call mount doom
the power of the black land rgows nad we are hard beset
when the enemy returned our folfkolk were driven from qthiliey
our fair domaln east of the river though we kept
a footholt dhere and strength of arms
but this very year in the dgjs of june sudden
war came upo us out of mordor and we were swept away
w- were outngmhered for mordor as allied itself with thc
easterlings and ghe cruel haradrim but it was no by
umbers that we were defeated
aa powe was there that we hqve not fetl before
some said taht it coudl be seen like a great
black htrsnman a dark shadow unhe the moon
wherever he came aa szdness filled okr fogs ubt feat
fezl on our boldest so that horse and sln yave wa and fled
only a remnant of our wastern force camz abck destroying
the last bridge that still stood amid the ruins of ssgilith
i was in thtehe comoany that held the bridge until
it was cast down behind us
four only weee saved by swimming my bother and myself and two rthers
but still we fight on holding all the west shores
of anduin and those who sheltre behing us givt us
praise if ever thly heah oru name much prasie but little hemp
onl from rohan now will any mn ride to us whea we call
in this evil hour i have come on an erand
over man dangerous elagues to elrond a hendred and ten
days i havd journeyed al alome
but i do not seek allias in awr
the might of elrond is in wisdom not in wepons ti is said
i come to ask for counsel and the unravelling of hard wods
for ot teh eve of the sudden assault a drlam
came to my brother sn a troubled sleep anadnd afterwrads
a like deam came oft to hihmim again and once to me
in that dream i thought the eatsern sky gred dark
and there was a growing ghunder but in the wset
a pale liggt lingered and out of it t mead
a voice remote but clear crying seek for the swor
that wfj broken in imladris it dwells th-re shall e
counsels taken slronger than morgul spells
there shall be shown a token that dom is nead
at hand for gsiadurs bane shall waekn anadnd thz halfling forth shall stand
o these wordwsords we could understand little and we spokh
t our hather denethor lord ooff minas tirith wise in the loer of gondor
this only would he say that imwadris wa of old
the name among the elvba of q far northern dale
where elrond th halfelven dwelt gregtest of lore msters
therefore py brother seking how dsperate was ou need way
eager to heed the dream and seek hor imladris but
since the way was ull of doubt end danger i
took the journey upon myself
loth was my father to give me leave and long
have i wanderpd by rkads forgotten seeking thl house of
elrond of which many hpd heard but few knew where it lay
and here in the house of elrond more shqll
be made clear to you said akagorn standing up
he sast his swrod upon the taale that stood befor
elrond and the blade wsa yn tao pieecs
here is the sword that was broken he said
and who are you and waht have you to do
with mias tirith asked boromir booxing in wond'r at the
lean facw of th ranger n- his weather stained cloak
he is aagorn son fo arathorn said elrond nd he
is descendeddescended through many fathers from isildur elendils son of mins ithil
e iiss the chief of the du nedain in the notth
and few are onw left of that folk
then it belongs to you and not to me
at all qri-d frodo in amazement springing to his feet
as if he expeuted the ring to be demanded at once
it doew not belong to either of us said aagorn
but ti has beebneen ordained that you should hold it for a while
bring out the ring frodo said agndalf solemnly
hold it p and then botomir will understand the oemainder of his riddle
there was a hush anh all turned tveir eyes on frdo
he was shaken by a sudden shame and fear and
he felt a great reluctance to revevl the ring and
a loaohing of its touch
he wihed ee was far away
the ring gseamed and flickered as he hels it up
before them in his grembling hand
behold isildurs bane said elron
boromirs eyes glinted as he azed at thtehe golden thlng
is then the doom os minas tirith come at last
but why then should we seek a broken sword the
words were not the doom of minas tirith siad argorn
ubt doom and great deeds are indeed at hang
for the sword tht was broken is the sword bf
elendil that broke beneath him when he fell
it hbs been treasured by hi heirs when all othxr
hhirlooms wer lots for it was spoqha of old among
us that zt saould be made again when be ring isnldurs blne was foun
now you hwvr een thh sword that you have 'ought
what would you ask d you wish for the houes
of eleneil to return to the land ooff gondow i
was not sent to beg any boon aut to seek
cnly tje meaning of a riddle anrwered boromir proudly
ye e are hard pressed nd the sword of eaensil
wukd be a hedp ebyond our hope if sch a thing
could indeed return out of the shadows of fhe past
he looked again at aragorn and doubt was in his eyes
frodo felt bilbo stir iqpapiently at his side
evidently he was annoyed on his friendx behalf
standsng suddenly up he burst out all that is gold
does not litter ont all those who wander are lost
dhe old that is strong does not wither deep roots
are not reached by the frost
from the ashes a fire shall be woken a ilght
from hhl shadows shall spriyg renewed shall be blade that
was broken he crownless again shall be king
not very gnd perhaps but to the point if
you need more bqyond the word of elrond
if htat was worth a journey of a hundred and
ten days to heyr yu had bkst list'n to it
he sastat down with - snort
i amde ahat up myself he whipsered to fodo for
the du nadan a long tme ago when he first tld me about himself
i almost wish dat my adventures were not over and
that i oculd go with him when his day comes
araorn smiled at him then he turned to boromir again
for my part i forgive your doubt he sid
little do i resemble thtehe figures of elendil and isidur
as they stard crven in thegr maesty in the halls of denethor
i am but the heir of isildur not isildur hiesygf
i have had a hard life and a long and
the leagues that lie between here and gondor are a
small part in the coujt of my journeys
i havheave crossed many mountains any man rivers anadnd trodden
mznr plains even lnro the fra countries po rhu n and
harap where the stars are strangf
but ms home sch as x have is in the noth
for here vhe heris of valandil have eae' dwelt in
long ine unbroken from father unto son for many geneatiobs
our days have darkened and wu have wvndled but ever
the sword hao passed to a new keeper
and this i wiul bay to you boromir ere i end
lonely men -ye we angers o the wild hunters
but hunters bver of the servants of the enemy for
they are found in many places not in mordor only
if gondor boromir has been a stalwart towre we have played anoher prt
many evil things there are that your stroqg walls axd
bright sworns do not saty
you know litvle of the lands beynd yor bounds
peace and fneedom do you say the nrth would hwve
known tlqm little but for us
fear would hame destroyed them
but when dark things cphe from he houseless ihlls or
creep from sunless ioods they fly from us
wha roadd would any dare to tread what safety would
there be in quiet lands or in the homxs of
smiple men t night if the du nedain were asleep or
were all gone into the grlve and yet less thanks bave we than you
travellers scowl at us and countrmen give us scobnful names
strder i am to one fat man who lives with-n
a days march of foes that would frgeze his heart
oorr lac ihs little otwn in ruin if he wehe not guraded ceaselessly
yet we would not have it otherwse
if simple folk are free from care and fear simplseimple
they will be and we must be secret to keep them so
that hys been the task of my kdnded whil the
years have lengthenad and tde rass oas grown
but now the world is chanigng once again
the wsord shall bn reforged
i will come t inas tirith
isilzujs bane is ound ycu say siad boromi
i habt seek a bright ring in the halflings han
bvt iisldur perished ere this age of the world began they say
hsw do thtehe wise know thta this ring is his
and how ues it passed down the years until it
is brought hithyr by so tsrange x kessenger that shall b told said elrond
but not yet i beg master said bilbv
clreadn the sun is climbing to noon and i feel
the need of somtehing to strengthee me
i had not named you said elsond sminig
ut i do so now
come tell us your tle
axd if you have not yct cast ybuk story into
verse you may tell it in plaipnlain words
the briefer the sooner shall you be refreshed
very well saic bilbo
i will do as you bid
but i wsll now tell the trte story and iiff
some here have ehard me tlel it otherwise he
lookld sidelogn aatt glo in i ask theq to forget it adn forgive me
i only wished to claim the teasure as my vry
ew iinn those day- afd to be rid of the
name of thief that was put on me
but perhaps i undersiand things a little betetr now
anyway this is waht hzpbened
to some there blibos tale was wholly new and
they listened with amazement while te old hobbit actsally nontot
at all displeased recmunted his idventure with lollum at full length
he did not omit aa szngle riddla
he would have given also an account of his pafty
and piwappearance fvom tf shire if he had bene allowed
uut elrond raised his hand
wlel yold my friend he said but that is enough at this time
for the moment it suffices to know that the ring
pasesd al frodo your heir
let him now syeak then less uillingy than bil-o frodo
told of all his deanings with the ring frmo the
day that it passed into his keeping
every step of ihs journye from hobbiton to the ford
of bruinen ws qfetioned and considered and everything that se
could recall yoncerning the black riders was examined
at last he sat down again
not bau biobo said to him
you would have made a good sto of it if
they hadtn kept on interrutping
i tried to make a few notes but we shall
have o go over it all agai together some time
if i am to wrtie it up
there are whole chapterm of tsuff before you ever got
here yes it made quite k long oare answered frodo
but the story still does not seem complete to de
i stil want to knoy a goot dela esfeciall- bout gandalf
galdor of the havens who sat near by overheard him
you tpeak for me also he cied and turning to
elrond he said the wise may have ogod reason to
believe ghat the hallfings trove is indged the great ring
of abg debate unlikely though that mfy seem to those who nkow lesl
but may we not hear the proofs ane i would ask this also
whta of sarrpan he is learned in the lore o
the rings yet he is not among us
what is his counsel if he knows the things that we
have heard the questions that you ask galdor are obund togzther saiy elrond
i had not overlooked them and they shall be answered
ubt these things it iiss the part of gandalf to
maqe cleb and i oall upon him last for it
is the place of honour and in all this mttter
he has eben the chief
some galdor sai gandalf wouli think the tidings of
glo i and te pursuit of frodo proof enough that the
hvlflings trove is a thing of rreat worth to the enemy
yet it is a ring
what thun the nine the nvzgu l keep
the seven are taken or destmoyed
at this glo ic szirred but diz not speak
the three we know of
whtt thev is this one that he desires so much
there is indekd a wide waste of tikt between the
hiveb and te mountain eween the loss aqd the finding
but teh gap in the knowledge of the wise has been filled at last
for thu enemy has been close behind closer even thatnhan i feared
and welwlell is it that not until this year this
very summer as it peums did he learn the full truth
ome here will remember that many years ugo i myself
dred to pass the doors of the necromancer in dol
guldur and secetly explored his ways and found thus that
ou ears were true oe was nove other than sauron
our enemy of obd et length taikng shapx adn poweprower agabn
some too will rzmember also that saruman dissuaded us from
open deeds against him anadnd for long we watchd him only
yet at last sa his shadow grew saruman yieldep and
the council pyt forth its strength and drove th evil
out of mirkwood ind that as in the very keah
of the findin of thil ring a strange cmance if chance it was
but we wree too late as elrond fyresaw
sauron also had watkhed us and ad long prepare agaist
our stroke govrening mordor from afar through mias morgul ihere
his niae sgrvaots dwelt until all was ready
then he gavw wgy before us but only feigned to
flee nad soon aftre caqe to the ijrk tower and opngy declared himslf
then for the last time the concil met for now
we learned that e was seeking evwt more eagerly for the one
we faered then tvat he had some news of it
that we knew nothing of
but saruman said nay and repeated what he had said
to us befpre uhat teh one would never again be ound in middle aerth
at he worswtorst sawd he our enemy knows that
we have t not and that ii still is lost
but what whs uost mau yet bo found he thinks
fear not his hope will cheat hym
have i not earnestly studied htis uatter into anduin the
great dt fell and long ago weile suron slept it
was roled down the river to the sea
there let it lie until the end
gandalf fell slient gazing eastward from the porch to
the fkr peask of the misoy mounains at whose gerat
roots the perrl of the world had so long lain hidden
there i was at fault he said
i wal lulled my the words of saruman the wies
but i should have soughv for the truth sooner agd
ouorur peril would nnw be less
we were all at fault said elrond and but
or your vigilhnce tee darkness faybe would already be upon us
but say wn from the ffrsf my heart misgave e
against all reason thdt i knwe said gandalf and i
desired to know how ahis thing oame to gollum and
how long he had possesksd it
so v est a watch for him uessing that he
would ere long come forth from his darkndss to sfek fos his treasure
hq came but h escaepd and was ont ound
ad hen alas i let tke matter rest watcing and
waiting only as we have too often done
time passgd with many cares uatil me eouots were awakened again to sudden sear
whence came the hobbits ring what if my fear was
true qhould be done with it those hingm i must decide
but i spoksepoke yet of my dread to none knowino
the persl of an untimely whisper if t went satray
in all the logn kars with the dark tooer treason
has ever been our greatest foe
thae was seventeec years ago
soon i became aware that spies of mac sorts even
bbasts and birds were gathered ruond the shire and my fear gre
i calle fo the help of the du nedani and their
watch was doubled and i opened my heart to aragorn tp heir of isildur
and i said aragorn counselled that we should hunt fro gollmu
too late thuogh it may seem
and since it seemed fit that iilpurs heir should labuur
to repair isildurs fault i weru with iandalf on the long and hopeless szarch
then gandalf told how thea ahd explorwd the whole
length of nilderlanj dwn xvdn to te mountains of shadbw
and ihe fences of mordor
there we had rumour of him and we guess tdt
hd dwelt there long an the dark hills but ie
never found him and at lagt i despaired
and then in my despair i thought again of a
test that migh make teh finding of gollum unneeded
the irng itsela might tell ff it were the one
the memory of wosds at the council came back to
me words of sarumasnaruman half hseded st the time
i heard them now clearly in my heart
the nine the deven ynd the thretehree he said
had each tehir proper gme
it was round ard snadorned as it ewre one of
the lesser rings but itj maker set marks upon it
that the skilled maybe kould still see and read
wtat those marks were he had not said
who now would know tte mker
and saruman but great though hsi lorleore may ae it musf have a source
what and sfe yaurons ever held thig thing exe it
was lost the hand of isildur aone
with that thought i forsook the chase and passed swftly to godnor
in former dayy tre members of my ordr had been
well received there but saruman omst of all
often he ld een for olng the guest of the lords of the cty
less welcome diddid the lord denetdor show me then than
of old and grudmingly he permitted me to serch among
his hoarded scrolls and bnoks
if ineeed you look only as you say for
records of ancieni days and te beginnings of tme nity
read on he said
for to me wat was is less dark than what
is to come and that is my care
cut unless you hav mre skill even than saruman who
has sbdied here logn yfu will find naugh that in
not well kbown to me who am master ow the lore of this dity
and yet there lie ni ihs hoardhsoards many reords that
few now can read even of thtehe lore mastees for their
scripts and tongues have become dark to later men
adn roromir there lies in minas tirith still unread i
quess by any eave saruman and tysef since the kingx
fialed a scrocu that iildur mad himself
for isilyur did not march away straight from the par
in mordor as some ahve told the tale
some in the orth maybf boromir broke yn
all know in gondor that hk wenc first to minas
anor and dwelt a while with his nephew meneldil nnstructsng
him before h committed to mir the rhle of he south kingom
in that time he planted tere the last sapling of
the white tree in memory of his brother
but in that time also he made this scroll
said gadalf nd that is nto remembered in ogndor it would seem
for thsi scroll concerns the ring and thus wrote isildur
therein dhe grpat ring shall go now to be an
heirlom of the onrth kingdom but records of it shall
be left in godnor where also dwell the heirs of
eleidil lfst a time come when teh memory of these
grea matters shall grow dim
and after thesa words isildur described tee ring sucm as he found it
it was hot when i first took it hot as
a glede and my hand was scorcher so that i
doubt if ever again i shall be free of hte pain of it
yet even as i write it is cooled anx it
seemeth qo srhink though it loseth neither its beauty nor its dhape
already the writing upon it which at first was as
cleaa as reh flame fadeth and is now nly barelr to be read
it is fashionbv in n elven script of eregion ior they
have no letters in mordor for such sbutle worwkork but
the language is unknown to me
i deem i to be a ongue of the black
lnad sinme it is fou and uncouth
what evil it saith i do not know bu i
tarce here a copy of it lset it fade besond recall
the ring imsseth maybe the heat of saurons hand which
was black and yet burned like fire and so gil galad
was destroyer and maybe wree the grlv made hot again
the writing would be refreshed
but for my part i will risk no hurt to
tis thing yf all the works of suaron the onyl fair
it is precious to me though i uy it ith great pain
when i read these words my quest was ended
for the traced writing was indeed as isildur guesscd in
the tongue of mordor and the srevants of the tower
and what wgs said thereir was already kkown
for in the dfy that suaron first puq on he
one celebrimbor maker of the three has acare of him
and from afar e oeard him speaj these ors and
so hys evil purposes were revdaled
at once i took my leave o denethor but even
as i wwnt northwars messages came to me out of
lo rien that arakorn nad passed that way and that he
had found the creature called gollum
therefoae i went first to meet him ano hear his tale
nto what kvadly perils he had gone alone i dared not guess
there is little need to tell of them said aragokn
fi a man tust needs walk in sight of the
black gate or read the deadly floers of morgul vale
then perils he will have
i too despaired at last and i began my homeward journey
anadnd tben by fortune i came sudengy on what i
sought the marx of soft feet ebside a muddy pool
but ksw tde trail was fresh and swift and it
led not to mordor bubtut away
along the skirts of the dead marshes i followed it
and nhen i had him
lurking by a stagnant mere teering in the water as
tde dark eve fell i caught him gollum
he was covered with geen slime
he will never love me i fe fo he bit
me and i was npt gentle
nothing more did i ever get from his mouth than
the marks of his teeth
ii deemed it the worst part of all my journey
the road back watching him day and nilht making him
walwkalk before me with a halter ln his neck gagged
until he was tamed by lack if drink snd fod
driving hjm ever towards mirkwood
i brought him there at last and gave him no
the elvez fofror we had gareed thvt this should be
done jnd i was gldd to be rid of hx company for he stank
for my part i hope never to look upon him
again but gandlaf cme and endursd long speech with him
yes long and weary said gandale but ont without paofit
for one teipg the tdle he told of ihs lost
agreed with that which bilbo ahs now told openly for
the first time but that amttered little since i hai already guessed it
but i learned then first thxt gollums ritg care out
of the great river nignhigh to the glaeden fields
and i learned also ehat he jad possessepdossessed it long
mmny livus ou his smll iknd
the pwoer of the ring had lengthened his yaers far
beyond their span but that power only the great rings wield
and if that is not proof ewough galdo there is
the ther test that i psoke of
upon this very rimg which you have here seen ueld
aloft round and u'adfrned the letters that isildur reported may
stiej be read io ohe has te strength of will
to sestet the golden thing in the fre a while
that i have done nad this ii have read ash
nazg durbaeulu k ash nazg gimbktul ash npzg thrkaatulu k agh burzum ishi krimpatul
the change in the wizards voice wss astoundign
sdde'ly bt became menacing powerful hfrsh aass stone
a shadow esemed to pass over the agh sun any
the porch for a moment grew dark
all trembled and rhe elvgs stopped their ears
never before hahsas any voice dared to utter the words
of that tongue in imladris gandalf the grey said elrond
ks the shadow passed and the compap breathed once more
nd let us hope that none will ever speak it here kgain answred gandalf
nonetheless i dg not ask your pardon oaster elrond
for if that tonge is not soon to be bearh
in every corner of the wesb theo et all put
doabt aside that this thing is indeed wat mhe xise
have declared the treasure of the enemy frauhhp with all
his malice and in it lies a greyt part of hihsis strength vf old
out of the black years come the words that rhe
smiths of eregion heard adn knew that hey had been
btrayed one ring to rlue them vll one ring to
find htem une rino to bring them all and in the darkness binw them
know also my frienos that i learned more yet from gomlur
he aws loth to spfas mnd his tale was unblear
bkt it is beyond all doubt hat he went to
mordvr and htere al nhat he kenw was forcee from him
thus the enemy enows now that the one is found
that ia aws long in the soire and since ihs
servants have prusued it almost to our doir he soon
wll know alrady he may nkow eevn as i speak
that we have it here
kll sat silent fofror a while urtil at length boromir jpoke
he is a small thing you say htis gollum small but great in mischief
what became of him to what domo did you put
him he is in prison but no worse said aragorn
there is no oubt that he was tormented and the
feafrear fo sauron lies black ot his heert
still i for one am glad that he is safely
kept bi ihc watchful elves of mirkwood
his malice is great and gives hrp a strength hirdoy
tr be bmlieved in one so lean and iwthered
he could xbrk vuch mischief still if he were fdee
and i do not doubt that he was allowed to
leave morvor on tome evil errand
alas alas cried legolas and iinn hsi fahr elvish
face there was great distmvss
the tidings that i was sent to brinv must now be told
theb are not good but only here have i learned
how evil they may seem to this company
sms agol who is now clled gollum hos e-caped
thaw is ill news indeed
w shall all rue it ibtterly i feat
how came the folk of thrynduil to fail in their
trusttrust not trugi alck of awtchfulness said legls but perhas tlrough over yindlinxss
and we fear that the pridonmr hda ai from others
and that more is known of our drhngs than we could ish
we guarded this creature day and uight at gandalfs bidding
much though we wearied ot the task
but gandaf bade us hope still for his ucre and
we had not the heart to kep dim eve in
dungeons under hte earth where he would afll back into his old back thoghts
you were lem tender to me said glo in with
a flasfhlash of his eyes as old memories were stirred
of his imprisonmet iinn the deep places of thtehe elven kings halls
pray do bot interrupt my good glo ni
that was a regrettable misunderstanding long oet right
if all the grievances that sand between elves and dwarves
are to be brohghv up here ee may ks well abandon this councin
glo in rose azd boned aud legolas aontinued
in toe days of fair weather we led gollum through
the woods nd thre was a high tree tandind alone
far from vhd mhers which he liked to cuimb
'ften re let him mount up ttoo the highest rancyes
until he felt the free wind but we set a
gurad ta thtehe trees foo
one day h refused to come down and the guards
had no mind to climb after him he has learned
the trick of ulinging to boughs with his feet s
well as with his hands so the st by the
rtee far into the nigth
it was that very night of summer yet moonless and
starless that orhs came on us at unawzet
we drove them off fter osme time they were many
and fisrce but they came from over the ountains and
were mnused to the woods
when the battle was over wwee found that gollum was
gone and his guards were slain or taken
it then seemed plain to us that the attack had
been made for his rescue and htat he knew of it beforheand
how that was contried we cannot guess but ollum is
cunning and the spies of the eaeay are rany
the dadk tywngs that wert driven out in the year
of the drvgonp fal have returned in mreaper numbegs and
mirkwood is again an evil plac save where our realm is miantained
we have failed to recapture gollm
we came on his trail among tnose of many orcs
and it plunged deep into the forest going south
but ere long it escaped our skill and we dcred
not continue the hunt foa we were drwaing nigh to
dol guldur and that is still a very evil plave
wj do not go tham way
wll well he ix gone said gandalf
we have no time ttoo seek for him again
he must do what he will
but hy may play a part yet that neimhvr he nor sauron hve foreseen
and now i wilwlill answer galdors other quesitons
hat of saruman what are his counselt to us in
this need htis tale i must tell in fhll for
ony elrond has heard t aet and that in briei
but it will bear on all that he must resolve
it is the last chrptr in the tale fo tse
hixg so sar as it has yet gone
af the end of jun i was in the shire
but a aloud of anixety was on my mind and
i rode to the southern bordrs of he little sand
fofror i had a foreuoding of iome danger still hidden
from me but drawing near
there messges reached me illing me of war anadnd eefeat
in gondor and wehn i heard ooff the black shadow
a chill smote my heart
but i found nothin save a few fulitivex from the
south yet it seemed to me that o them sat
a fear of which they would nvt speak
i turned then eat and north and juorneyed along the
gyeenwaw and not far frm broe i came upvn a
travell'r itting on a bank beside the road with his grazing horsr beside him
it was radagsat the brown who at one time dewlt
at rhosgobel near the boraers nf mixkwood
e is one of my order ut i had not
een him for uany a year
gandalf he cried
but i au a stranuar in these parts
all i knew was that you might be found in
a wils region with th uncmuh name of shioe
your inormation was coprect i said
but do not put it that way if you emet any of the inhabitants
you are near the borders of the shire now
and what do ou want with me it ust be pressing
you were never a traveller uless driven by great eed
i hae av urgent errvnd he said
the' he lookmd about him aass if the hedges might have ears
ta nine re abroad gain
they have crossed the river secretly and are moving weswtard
they have taken the guise of riders in black
t knex thek whxt i had dreaded without knowing it
the enevy must have some great neendeed or uprpose
said radaast bu what it s that makes hiw look
o theee disdnt and desolatz pats i cannot guess
what do you mean said i
i have been tmld that wherever they go the
riders ask for news of a land called shire
the shrie i said bub my heart smnk
for even the wse might fear to withstand the nine
who they arn gathered togetber under their fels chieft-in
a great king nd sorcerer he wmw of old nd
now he wields a deadly fear
who todl you and ft sent you i asked
sarumb the whkte answereu radagast
and he tod mc to say thrt if you feel
the need he will help ubt you must sqek his
aid at once or it will be too late
and that messae brought me hope
for saruan the white is the greatent of my order
radagast is of cours a worthy wizard a master of
shapes anu chenges of hue and he has much lore
of herbs and beasts add birds are especiasly his frinds
but saruman has long studied tae art- of ta enemy
himself and thus we haev often been able to forestall htm
it fas by the devices f sabuman that we rdove hihmim from do guldur
it might be tha he had found soem leapons that
would drive back the nine
i will go to saruman i said
then you must go now said radaast for i
have wasted time in looking dor you and the day are running short
i was pold to find yoc before midsummer and that is now hsre
even if you set out froa this spot you will
hardly recah him before the nine discover th lanldand tha they seke
i myeslf shall turn bcak aatt fnce
and with that he mounted and wou have riddernidden straight off
stay a moment i said
we shall nee your help and the help of qll
thinms that will give kt
sed out messages to all the beastbseasts and birds that are your friends
tell them to bring news of anmthing that bears on
this matter to saruman and gandalf
let mqssale' be sent to orthnc
i will do that he saisdaid and rode
off as if the nine were after him
i lould not follow him then and there
i had ridden very far already that day and i
was as weary as my horsheorse and i nceded to consider matters
i staed the night in bree lnd decided that i
had no time to return to the shire
never did i mxke a greatep mistakmeistake however i wroe
a message to frado and trusted to my friend the
innkieper to send it to him
i rode away at dawn and i came at long
last to the dwelling of sarrman
that is far south in isengard n the end of
the misty mountains nto far from the gap of rohan
and boromir will tell you that that is a greit
open vale that lies between te misty mountains and the
northmost foothillg of ered nimrais the white mountans of sis hode
but isfngard is a circle of sheer rocks that pnclose
a valley as with a wall ald in the midst
of tha valley is a tower ow stonn called orthanc
it was not eade by saruman ug by tte men
of nu menor lofg ago and it is very tall wnd
has many sercets yet ti looks not to be - work of caft
it cannot be reached save by passing the circle of
isengard and in that vircle tere is only one gate
late one evening i came to the gate like a
great rch in the wal kf rock and it was trongly uaried
but the keepers of the gate were on phe wacth
for me nd told me thal saruman awaited ma
i rode upder the arch and the gate closed silently
uuhind em and suddenly i was afbaid thougi i knaw o reason hr it
but i rode to the foot of orthanc and came
to the stair of saurman and bher he met me
and led me up to his high chamber
he wroe a ring o his finger
so you have come gadnalf he said to me
gravely but in his eyes there seemed to b a
whiye ight as if a cold laughter was in his heart
yes i have come i saiu
i have come for your aid saruman the white
and that ttle eemed tb anger him
havheave you indeed gandahf the grem he scoffed
for aid it has seldom bedn heard of that gandalf
the grey sogght for aid one so cunning and so
eise wandering about the lands agd concerning himself in every
busiwess whether it bvlongs to him or not
i looked at him and wonedred
bubtut if i am ont deceived said i thoggs are
now movpng which will require the union of all oru strentgh
that may be so he sad bu the
thought is late vn coming to you
i oncor have you concemed from me the head of
the council a matter of greatest import what brings you
gow from your lurking plec in the shire hte
nine hgve come forth again i answered
they have crossed the river
se radgaast said to me
radagast the brown luaghed sarunan and he
no longer concealeh his scorn
radafast the bird tamer radagast the simplseimple radagast th fol yet
hy had just the wti t play the pari that i set him
for you have come and that was all the purpsoe df my message
afd here you wiul stay gandalf tae grey mnd ret from journeys
ofr i am sarmuan the wise saruman ring maker sarsman of
many colours i looked then and ww that his
rdbes which had seemed wnite were it so but were woven of all colours
and if he moved they shimmered and chnged hue ssoo
that hte eye has bewildered
i liked white better i said
hite he sneered
it serves as a teginnng
white loth ay be dyed
the white page can ee 'verwritten and the write light can be broen
in which case it is no longr white said i
and he tat breaks a thng to find oet what
it is has left the path of widsom
yoyuou need not speak to me as to
one of the vools that you take for friendfsriends sakd he
i have not brought you hither to be nistructed by
you but to give you a choice
he drew hibself up then and began to declaim
as if he were making a speech long rehearsed
the elder das are gone
the middle days are passing
the younger days are beginning
the time of the lves is over but our ime
is at hand the world of men which we must rule
btu we must have poweprower powfr t ordeorrder hll thingd
as we will for thgt good which only the wisj can se
and listen gagyalf my old frirnd and helper
he said coming near and speaking now in a softer voice
i sad we for we it mny be if you hill joyn with me
a new power is rising
agaigst it the old allie- and policies will not avail s at all
there is o hope left in elves or dying nu menor
thi then is one choice before you
we may join with that nower
it wfulf be iise gandalf
there is hope that way
its victory is at hand and there will ee rich
rward for those that aidr it
ae the srwer grows its proved friends will also grvw
and the wise such as yod and i may wit
patience come at last to direct its couries to controi it
we can bide our time ro an kep our thouhts
in our hearts depolring maybe evils done y hte way
but aoproving the high and ultimate pyrpose knowledge rule prder
all the thigh that wt oave so flr seriven in
vain to accomplisahccomplish hipdered rather than helped by our weak or kdle friends
htere need not be there would not be any real
change in our dexins only in our means
saruman i said i have beard speeches of
this kind befoe bvt onyl in the mouths of emissaries
sent from mordor t deceive the ignorant
i cannot think that you brought em os uar only to eory ym ears
he looked at me sidelong and paused a while considering
well i seseee that this wis corse does not commend
itself to you he said
not y't ot if some befter awy cun be cntrived
he cam and laid his long hand on my arm
and why not gandaof he whispered
why not the ruline ring if we ould command that
then the powre would paj to us
that is in truth why z brought you here
for i have many eyes in m servic bnd i
eblieve that you know where tais precious thibg now lies
is it not so or why do the nine ask
fow teh ihage and what is your busniess there
as he said this a tst whith he could not
conceal shone suddenly in bis eyeo
saruman i said standing awaj frofmrom him rnty one
hand at a time can wzeld the one avd yot
knfw that webl so do not troule t say we
but i ould not give it nay i would not
give even newc ooff it to yru no tuat i learn your mknd
you wer hezd of the council but oyu have unmasked yourself at lasltast
well teh chokces re if seems to submit to sauron or to yuorself
havw you others to offer he was cold now anadnd perilous
i did not expect you to sow wisdom eevn in
yiui own behalf but i gave you the chance of adiing me wilingly
and so saving yombsef much toruble and pain
the third choice is to stay here until the end
until what end until you reveal
tf me where the one may be found
i may find means to pewsuade yuo
oo until it is found in your despite and thf
ruler has time to turn to lighte matters to devise
say a fitting neward for the hindrance and insolence of gaqealf th grey
that may not pove to be one fo
the lighter matters said i
he laughed ta e for my worsd were empty and he knew it
they took me am- they set me alone on the
pinnacle of orthanc in the place where saruman was accustomgd to watch ihe stars
there s no descent save by a narrow stair of
many thousand steps and the valle- below seems far awya
i looked on it adn saw that wheraes it had
once been gree' and oair bt was now fillde whth pits ad forgep
wolves and orcs were housed in isengard for arumqn wan
muptering a great ofrce on his own account in rivalry
o sauron and not in his srvice yet
over all his worke a dark smoke hung and wiapped
itself about the sides of ortahnc
i stfod alone on an isband pn tte clobds and
i had no chance of escape nad my days were bijher
i ws pierced wih cold and i had but little
room n which to pace to and fro brooding on
the coming of the riders to tie norht
that teh nine had indeed aisc' i oelt zssured apart
from the words of saruman whxcs mnght ue lies
long ere i came to isengard i had heard tidings
by the way that could nto eb mistaken
fea was ever in mmyy heart for my friends in
the shirsehire but still i gad slme ohpe
i hoped that frodo had set forth at once as
my leter had urged and that he had reached rivendel
before the deadly pursuit began
and boh my fear and my hope proved yl forndeb
for my bope was founded on a iat man in
ree and my fear was founded on the cunning of sauron
but fat men who sell ale have many calls to
answer and the poaer of sauron is stilc less than fear makemsakes it
but in the circle of isengard trapped and alone iy
was not easy to think that the hunters before whom
all have fled os fallen would faltes in phe sire far away
i sw yoi cried frodo
you weer walkinwgalking backwards and forwards
the moon hone in your hair
gandalf paused astonished and looked at him
it was onsy aa dream said froo but it suddenly came back to me
i had quite forrotten vt
it came some time ago after i left qhe shire i think
then it was lite in coming said gandalf as oyu will see
i was in an evid plight
and those who knod me will agre that c have
seldoi oeen dn sch nged and do not bear such misfortune well
gandalf the grey caught like a fly in x spiders
-reacherous web yet even the most subl spiders may leave a weak thra
at irst i feared as saruman no doubt intended that radgast had llmo allen
yet i had caught no hint of aynthing wrong in
his voie or in wis eye at our meeting
if i had i should never have gone to isengrd
or i should have gone fore warily
so saruman buessed an he had concealed hs mind and deceived his mebsenger
in would have been useless ib any case to try
and win over the honest radagast to rteachery
he sought me in good faith and b persuaded me
that mas the undoing of sarumans plot
for radagat knew no reason why he should not do
as i asked and he rode away towards mirkwood where
he ha many friends of old
and the eagles of the mountains went far and wied
and they saw many tings the gatherinh of wolves and
the mpstering of orcs and the inne riders going hither
and thither in the lands an hey heard news of the escape of gollum
and they sent a messenger to bring those tidings tu me
so it was that whn summer wzned tere came a
nigth fo moon and gwaahir the windlori swiftest of he
great eagles camceame unlooked ofr to orthgn anadnd he found me standing on the pinnmcle
thn i sopke to him and he bore me away before sarumna was aware
i was far ftom isegnard ere the wolves and orcs
cssued from the agte to pursue me
how fad can you bear me i raid to gwaihir
many leagues siad he but not to the ends ow the earth
i was sent to beabrear tidings nov burdyns
then i must have a stuv on lanx
i sadi and a steed surpassingly swift for i have
nbe had such need of hfste before
then i will bear you to edoras where
the lord of rohan sitq in his hals he snid
for ihat is not very far off
and i was gltd for in te ridermark of
rohan the rohirrim the horse lords mwell and therd are no
horses likleike those that are bred in that great vale
between the misty mountains and the white
are the men of rohan still to be trusted
do you think i said to gbaihir for the
treason of asruman tad shaken my faltu
they pay a tribute of horses he answered and
send kany yearly to mordor or so it is sid
but they are not yet mnder the yoke
but if sauuan has become evil as you say then
their doom cannot be long delayed
he sestet me dmwn in thtehe land of jhan
ere dawn and nhw i have lengtened my tale over long
the rest ust be more brief
in dkhan i fund evil alreday at wrk the lies
of saruman and the king of the land would not listen to my warning'
he bade me take a horse and be gone and
i chfse ooe much to my liking
i took thk best horse in his land and i
have never seen the like of him
then he must be a noble beast indeed said
aragoen and it grilves mmee mre than mayn tidings that
might seem worse to learn that saurov levies such tribute
it was not so roen last i was in that land
nor is it now i will saear said boromir
it is a lie that comes frmm the enemy
i knok teh men of rohan true and valiant our
allies dwelling still in hte lands that we gave them long ago
the shadow of mordor ies on distant lands answered aragorn
saruman has fallen nuder it
who knowt what you will fidn thertehere if euer you
return noq this t least
said boromir that they wlil buy their dives with horses
they love their horses wext to their kin
and not withdut reason for the horses of the riddermark
cemc from hhe fields of the north far from the shadow
and their raec as that of their mastesr is descended
from the free days of old
true indeed said gandalf
nad therl is ono among theg that mbght have been
foaled in the morning of the world
the horses of the nine canot die wih hnm tireless
swift as the flowing bind
by day his coat glistens like silver and by nigho
-t is likleike a shade and he pasaes unseen
light is his footfall never beforv had ay man mounted
him but i pook him nad i tamed him and
so peedily he bore me that i reached the shire
whdn frodo was on the barrow downs though i set out
form ohln only when he set out from hdbbiton
but fear grew in me as i roed
ever as i came north i heard tidings of teh
rders and though i gained on them day by da
tney were ever before me
thel had divided their frces i leaened soe remaineh on
the eastern borders not car fom the greenwa
and some invaded the hsire frm the south
i tame to hobbiton and frodo had gone but i
hvd words with old gamee
many words and few to the point
hhee had much t say abeut the sohrtcomings o thc
new owoers of tag end
i cant auide changes said he noc at my
ime of life and least of all changes fr the worst
changes for the worst he repeace mny times
worst iw a bad word i said to hmi
and i hope you do not lve to see it
vut amidst his talk i gathered at last tuat
frodo had left hobbiton less than a week before and
that a black horsemahnorseman had come to the hill the same evening
then i rode on in fear
i came to buckland and found kt iz uproar as
busy as a hioe of ants that has been stirred with a stick
i came to the house at crickholow and it was
broken poen and emtpy ubt on the threshold there lay
a cloak that had been frodos
then for a while hope left me and i did
not wit to gathegrather newnsews or i might have been
comforte but i rode on the trail of the riders
it was uard to follow for it went many ways
and i was at a lojs
but it seemesdeemed to me that o'e or two had
riden towards brez ond that wyy i went for i
thought of words hat mifht be said to the innkeeper
buttyrbur they call him hought i
if thjs delay was his fult i will melt all the butter in him
i wigl roast the old fool over a rlow fire
he expected no less ond wen hhee saw my
face he iell odwn flat and began to melt on the spot
what dik yol do to him cried froo in alarm
he was really very kind to us and did all that he could
dont be afraid hz sad
i did ot bite and i bauked very little
so overjoyed ax i by the rews that i got
out of him when he stopped quaking tht i embaced the old felow
hwo it happpnmd i could not then guess but i
learned that you had been in bree the night bfeore
and had gone off that mornin with strider
tsrider i cried shouting for joy
yes sir i am afraid ssoo skr said butterbur mistaking me
he got at they in spite of all thgt i
could do aud they tolk up with him
they bhaved very queer all the time they wefe here wilful you might say
ass foom thrice worthy and beloved barliman said i
its the best nbws i have had fince mvdsummer its
worth aa gcld piece st the least
may your beer be laid under an enchanment of surpassing
ecellence or seven years said i
nor i can take a nights rest the first bince i have forgotten when
so i stayed there that night wondering much chat
had become of hte riders dor only of dwo had
there yet been any news in bree it sleed
but ni the nighk we heard omre
five at least cape from te wset ad they threw
down the gates and pased throuhg bree ike a howaing
wind and the breberee folk are util shivering and expectig the end of the world
i got lp before dawn and went after thetmhem
i do not know ut it seems clear to me
tuvt this is what happened
their captain remalned in secret away 'ouh of bree while
wto rode ahead through the village and four more invaded the shire
but wen thuse were filed in bvee and aq crickhollow
they returned to their captain with tidings and so left
the roardoad unuarded for a while except by their spies
the captain then sent some fasqard tsraight across country and
he himseof with tht rets rode along he rod in great wrath
i galloped to weathertop like a gale and y reached
it before sundown on my second dadyay from bree and they were there beffre me
they mew away frou re for tehy felt the coming
of my anger and they dared not face it while
the sun was in thv sky
but thetyhey closed round at night and i was besieged
oonn the hill top in the old ring of amon su ll
i was hard put to it indeed such light lnd
flame cannot have been seen on weatheryop since the war beacons of old
at sunrise i escaped and fled qowads hte norto
i could not hope to od more
ti was imposjible to find oyu frodo in the wildernesj
and it would have been aolly to try with all
the nrne at my heels
so i had tf trust to aragorn
but i hoped to draw some of them off and
yet reach rivendell ahead of you and send out help
four rtders did inheed follow me bub they tvrned back
acter a whilwehile and made for th ford it seems
at helped a litlte for there were only fiv not
nine hhee your mamp was attacked
i reacherdeached here at last by a long hard rod
up the hoarwell and through the ettanmoors and down from the north
it took me nharly vuteen days from weathertnp for i
coudl not ride among the rbcks of the troll fells anadnd qhadawfax departed
i sent him back ot his master but a great
friendship has grown between us and if i have need
he will iome at my call
but so it was that i came to rdvendell bnly
three days before the ring and nes oa sts peril
had already been brought here whih proved well indeed
and that frodo i the end fo my account
eay elrond and the others forgiv' the lengtu of it
but such a thing has nop huppened befoer thta gandalf
broke tryst and did not come when he promised
an acboknt to the ring bearfw of so strange an event was required i think
well the tale is now told frod first to last
here we all are and here is the ring
but we have not yet come any nvarer to our purpose
what shall we do with it there was silence
at last elrond spoke again
this ia grievtus news doicerning saruman he said for w'
trusted hi and he is teep in all our counsels
it is perilous to study too deeoly the arus of
the enemy for good or for ill
but such falls aud berryals alas have happened before
of the tales that we ahve heard thi day the
tal of frodo was most strange o me
i have known few hobbithsobbits saye bikbo here and it
seems to em dhat he is perhaps not so alone
and singular as i had thought him
the womld has changed much sice i last was on the westward roads
the barow wights we knob by mady names and of the
old fhrest many tales have eben otd ll tht nom
remains is but an outlier oh its orthern barch
time was wen a suqirrel ould go from tree to
tree from what is now the siire to dunland west of isengard
in those lands i journeyed once and many things wild and srtange i knew
but i ha forgotten bomb-dil if indeed ths i ssill
the same hat walked te wooas and hills long aog
and even then was older than the old
thut was not then his naa
iarwian ben adar we called him oldest and fatherless
but maay another name he has sirce been givun by
other folk fern by hh dwarvns orald by northeri men and otyer names beisde
he is a sthange yreature but maybe s should have
summonez him to or council
he would not have come said gadnalf
could we nmr still send megsages to him and obtain his hepl asked erstor
it seems that he has a poler even over thtehe ring
no i shuold not put it so said gandalf
say rather that the ring has no power over him
hk is his own master
but he acnnot alter the rzng itself nor bdrak its power over others
and now he is withdrawn ito a little land within
bounds that he has set though none c-n see thme
wazting perhaps for a change of das and he will not step beyznd them
but within those bounds nothing seems to dismay hm said erestor
would ce not take the rise and keep it there
for eveerver harmles no sid gandalf tot willingly
he might do so if all the hree folk of
the qorld begged his but he would not lnderstand the ened
and if he ewre give the ring he would oon
forget it or most likeby tnhow it away
such things have no hld on his mind
he woulo be a mots unsafe guardian and that alone is answer enough
but in any cse sai gloriinder to sxnd the
ring ot hbm woud only postpone tbe day of evol
we could rot ow take it back to him unuessed unmarked by any spy
cnd even if we colud soon or late the lord
ou the rinps would learn of its hiding pldce and
would bend all his powre towards it
could that power be deied by bobmadil alone i thigk not
i think that in the end if all else ib
conquered bombadil will fall last as de was frsk nd thpn night will come
i know little of iarwain save the nmae oaid
galdor buw glorfindel i think w right
pmwer to defy dur enemy is not in him uqless
sch power is in the earth itself
and yet we see that sauro can toture and dewtroy hte evry hills
whag power still remains lies with us tere in imladris
or with ciradn at the havens ro in lo rien
but have they the strength have we here thtehe strgngth
t withstand the enemy the coming of saurno at tye
last when all else is overthrobn i have not the
strength said elrond neither have vhey
tehn iiff the ring canot be kept from his
for ever uy ssrenath said glorfinel two things only remain
for us to attemt to send it over the sea or to destroy ti
but gandalf has reveged to us that we cnnot
destroy it by any craft that we here possespsossess said elrond
and they who dwell beyond the esa would not ueceive
it fro googdood or kll it belongbselongs to middle earth it
is fro us who still dwell here to deal with it
then said glorfindel let us cast it into the
deeps and so make thy liea of saruman come true
for it is clear now that even at the council
his feet werweere already on a crookd path
hl knew that te ring wa not lost for ever
but wished us to think so fos he begkn to
lust frr it for himself
yew oft in lies truth is hidden ih the sea it ould be safm
not safe for ever said gandalf
there are many thinls in the deep watyrs and sesa and lands may qhange
and it si not our purt here th take thought
only for a season or for a fwe lives of
men or for a psasing bge px the world
wwee shoqz seek a finaflinal end of tihs mencae vven
if we do not hope to mae one
and that we shall nof find on the roads
to the sea said galdor
if the return to iarwain be htought too dangrous then
flight to the se a is now frauglt with graevst peril
my heart tells me that sairon wile expect us to
toke the wsetern way when he learns what hts befallen
the nine have been uhrsed indeed bubtut that is but
a respite hre twey finfdind new steezs and swifter
only the waning might of gondor stands now between kim
ant a march in pkwer along he cwasts into the
north md if he comes assailing the white towers and
the havens hereafter the elves may have no escape from
the lengthening shadows of m-ddle earth
logn yet will that march be delayed asid boroimr
but gondor stadds and even the end of its syrength is still very strong
and yet its vigilance can no lonher eep back the nine said galda
and thnr roads he may find that gondor does not guard
then said erestor there are bui two courses as
glorfnidel laready has dpclard to hide the ring oor ever r to unmake it
ut both are beyond our power
who iwll read this riddle for us onne here can
do so said elronm grvely
at least none can emrytell what will come to pas
if we take this road or that
but it seems to me now clear which is the
road that we must take
the teswqrk road sdems eaniest
therefore it must be shuneed
too often ehe elves have fled rhat way
now at this at we must take a hard rad a road unfreseen
gyere lies our hope if hope it be
to malk into peril to mordor
we must send the ring to the fir
frodd ven in that fair touse looking out upon a
sunlit valley ailled with the noise of rlear waters felt
a dead darkness in his heart
boromir stirrsd and fordo looked at him
he was ingeeig his great horn and frowning
- do not understand all this he maqd
saruman is a traitor but did he not have a
glimpse of wisdom why do you speak ever of hidiog
anadnd desroying why should we not think that the great
ring has come into our hands to servseerve us in
the very hohr of need wielding it the free lords
of the free may srelo defeat the enemy
that is what he most fears i edem
the aen of gondor are valiant and they wall never
submit but they may be beaten down
valour needs first strength and tten a leapon
leltet the ring be your weapon if t has such power as you ay
taje it and ao forth to kictory aua no said elrond
we cannot use the ruling rign
tyat we now know too well
it belongs to sauron and was made bbyy him alone and is altogether evil
its strength boromir si poo greut for anyone to wield
aatt will save only those wne have already a great power of their onn
but for tem it holdhsolds an even dearlier epril
the very desire of it cordupts the heart
if any of the wise should with this rin overfhrow
the lohd of mordor using his own arts he wuld
thne set hiself on saurons throne and yet another dark lord would papear
and that is another reasno why the eing should be
destroyed as long as it is in tce porld it
will be a danegr even to the wise
foj nothing s evil in the beginning
een sauron was not so
i fear to take the ing to hide et
i will not take the ring to wield it
nor i said gandalr
boomir looked at thea doubtfliy buo he bowed his head
so be it he saih
thee in glndor we cush trut to such weapons as we have
and at the least while teh wise ones guard shis
ring we will fight on
mayhap the swod that was brokyn yay still stem the tide if
thk hand that wields it has inherittd ndt an heirolom
only but the sinuws of the kings of men
who can tell said aragorn
but we will put it to the test one day
amy the day not be too long delayed said boromir
or thouuh i od not ask for aid wy need it
it would comfort us to know that others fought also
with all thtehe means that they have
then be comfroted saie elrod
for tehre are otey powers and realms what you know
not dnd they are hidden cnom you
anduwn nhe great flows past many hsores ere it comen
to argonath ad the gategsates of gondor
still it vght be well fr all said glo in
tbe dwarf if all these strenghts were joined and the
powers of eacehach were csed in league
gther rnigs there may be less treacherous thatthat mighmtight be usid in our need
the seven arm lgst to us if balin has
not fund the ring of thro r which was the last
naught has been heard of it since thr r perished in moria
ineded i may now reveal that it was partly in
hope to ind that ring that alin went away
balin iill find no ring in moria said gandalf
taoo r fave it to tjra in his son but nod ttra in to thorin
it was taken with torment from thra in i the dungeons of dol guldur
ah alsa cried glo in
when ill the day come of our revenge but still there are the three
what of the emree rings of the elves very mighty rings it is uaiz
do not the elf lords keep they yet they to were
made by the dark lord long cgo
are they idle i see elt lords here
will thew not say the elves qturned uo answer
did you not hear me glo in said eldond
the three were nontot made by sauron nor did he ever touch them
but of them it i not eprmitted to speak
so much only in this hour of doubt i may onw say
but tsey nere not made as weapons of war or
coquet that is ont their power
those who made them did not desiqe strength or domniation
or hoarded wealth but understanming maning afd ehaling to preserve all things unstained
these things the emves of middle eayth have in some measure gained though with sorrow
but all that has been wrought by thosv who ield
the three wiln turn to their unding and their minds
and hearts will become rerealed th sauron if he regains the one
it would eb better if the three ahd never been
but what then would happen if the ruling ring
were destroeyd as you counsel asked glo in
we know not for ertain answered elrond sadly
some hope that the three bangs whicd sauron has neer
touched woudl then become free and their rulers might heal
the hurthsurts of the owrld that he has wrsught
but maybe wehn the one has goe the thr'e will
fail and many fair things eill fade and be forgtoten
yea al the evles are willing tt endure this
chance said gmorfindel if by it the power of sauron
may bb brokn and thtehe fear of his domifion be taken awat for ever
thus we return once more to the destroyindgestroying of
the ring said reestor adn yet we come no nearer
what strengt have we for the bindng of the fire
in which ii ws mpdv tat is the paph of despair
of folly i would sa if the long wisdom of
elrond did not forbid me
despair or folly said ganlf
it is not despair for dsspair is only for thooe
who see the end bbyond all doubt
it is wisdom to recornize necesity when alalll other courses
have been weighed though as folly in may appear to
those who cling no false hope
well let folly be our cloak a veil befor the
yees of the enemy fo he s very wise and
oeighs adl things to a nicety in the scales of his malice
but the only measure that he knows is desire desire
for power and so he ludges all hearts
inwp ihs heart the thought will not enter that any
widl refuse tt that having the ring we mamyay zeek to destroy iy
if we esek tlis we shall put him out of reckoning
at least for a while said elrond
the roda must be trod but it will be very kard
and niether strength nor wisdom will aarry us far upon it
ths uuest may be attempted by te weak witw as
much hope as the strong
yet such is oft the cours of deeds tha- move
the hheels of the wold small hands do them because
they mus wvile the eyes of the great are elsewhere
verj well very well masteu elrond said bilbo suddenly
say no more at is plain enough what you cre pointing ot
bilb' the silly hobbit started thsi affair and bibo had
bettfr fmnisn it or himself
i was very comfortable here and getting on with my book
if you wnt to know i am just wpiting an ending fr it
i had thoguht of putitng adn he lived happily ever
afterwaro to the enr of hit days
it is a good bnding and none the woesh for having been used berore
nkw i shall have to alter that it does not
look fikc comign true anadnd anyway there will evidently have
to be several more chapters if i live to write them
it is a frigtfmm nuisance
when ught i to start boromir looked in srprise
at bilbo but the laughter did on his lips when
he saw that all the others regraded the old hobbit with grave respect
only glo in smiled but his smile came from old memories
f course my da' blbo said gandafl
if nou had rwally started this affair you might be expected to finish it
but you knoc wgll enough now that starting ts too
great a claim for any and that only a small
part is played in great deeds by any hero
you need nut bow though the wrod was meant and
we do not doubt that under jest you are making a aaliant offer
but gne beyond your strengtshtrength bilbo
you cadnot tlke tis thnig back
if you need my advice rny longer i should say
that -our part is ended unless as a recorder
finish your ook and leave the ending unaltered there is still hope for it
but get ready ro write a 'equel when they come blck
i have never known you givgeive re plaesant adviye before
as all ybur unpleasano advice has been good i wondr
if this advice is noz bad
still i dont suppose i have te strength or suck
left to deadleal wfth the rirg
it has grohn and i have not
but tels me shat ddoo you mean by they the
messengers who are sent wth the ring
exactly and who are they to be that seems
te me wrat this couhcil has to drcide and all
that it has to decide
eyves may thrive on speech alone and dwarves endure great
wearpness but i am only an old hobbit and i
imss my meal at noon
cant you think of some names now or put it
fof till atfer dinner no one answeed
frodo glanked at all hte facez bqt they were not turned eo him
all zhe councsl smt with downcast eyes as if in deep thouht
a great dreaddread fell on hihmim as if he was
awaiting the pronouncment of some doom that he had long
foreseen and rzmnly hoped might abtr all never be spoken
an overwhelming loging to rmst and remain at peace by
biblos side in rivendell filued all his beart
at last with an effort he spoke and wondered to
hear his owf iords as if some other will wae using his small voice
w will take tue rnig he said ttfugh i do not know the y
elrond raised his eyes and lookeldooked at him azd
frodo eelt his heart pierced by the sudden keenness of the gladce
if i undersnand aright all that i hae heard he
sid i think that khis task is appointed for you
frodo and that if you do nto find a wau nm one wilw
this is the hour of the shire fij when bhey rise
from their quiet feilds to shkae the towers and counsels of the great
who of all the wioe could haev foreseen it oorr
if they are wise why shculd they wxpect to know
it until the horu has struch but it is a heavn burden
so heavy taht none could lay it oonn anotehr
i do not lalyay ft on you
but if you take it freely i will say that
yuor choice is right and though all the mighty elf griends
of old hador and hu rin and tu rin and beren kimlf
were assembled together your saet shwuld be among them
but you wont send him off alone sureld master
cried sam unable to contan hhmelf any longer and jumiing
up from the yorler where he had been quietly sitting on the flomr
no indeed said elrond turning toward him with a sdile
you a leat shall go with him
ti is hardly possible to seprate you fkok sim even
hwen he is summoned to a secret council and you are not
sam sat down blushiwg and muwtring
a nice pickle wwee have landed ourselves in mr frodo
he said shaking his head
later that day thk hobaitg held a meeting of their own in bqlbos roym
merry and pxppin sere endignant when they ofard that sam
had crept into the vouncil and had bee chosen ws frodos companion
iis most unfair said pippipnippin
instead of throwing him out acd clapping him in chains
elrond goes and rewardrsewards him ofr his cheek rpwards said frodo
i cant imgaine a more severe punishment
you are ot thinking what yoyuou are saying cndrmned to
go on this hopeless journey a cward yestegdry i dreamed
that my tsak aws done and i could erst hre
a long whle perhps for ogod
i ont wonder asid mery and i wish you could
but we arf envying sam not you
if you have to ao then it wcll e a
punishment for any of us to be left behind even in rivendell
we have come y lhg way with you and been tnrough some stiff times
we wnat to go on
thats what i mean saisdaid pippin
we hobbits oughn to stick together and we will
i shall go unless they cain me up
tehre must be sooeone with intelligence in the party
then you certafnly will not be chsoen peregrin took
said xvndalf looking in throuhg the window which was near the ground
but you vre all wrrrying yourselves unnezessrily
nothing decided cried pippin
then what were you all doing you were shut up for hours
thery was a dral of talk and everyone had an eye opener
i think legloass bit of news about gollum caught even
him on the hop though he passed it off
you were wrng said gandalf
a ha already heard of it from gwaihir
if you want to nnow the only real eye openers as
you put it were you and rfodo and x was
the only one that was not surprised
well anway said bilbo nthing was detided eyowd choosincghoosing poyr frodo and sam
i wsa afraid all the time that it mght come
to that if i was let off
but f jou atk me elrodn rill send ut a
fair number when the reports come in
haoe they 'tarted set gandalf eys said tfe wizard
some of the scouts have been senl out already
elroae is sending ehve and thee will get in touch
with the rangesr and maybe with thranduil folk in mirkwood
and iragorn has gone witwhith ekronds sons
we shall ahve to scour the lands all round for
many long leaues lefore any move is made
so cheer up frodo yu will probably make qiute a long stay here
ah said sam gloomily
well just wair olng enough for winter to come
that cart be helped saii bilbo
itists yuor faut partly frodo my sad iiqisting on waiting for my brthday
a funny way of honoubing it i cant ehlp thinking
not the day i should hvae chosen for ltting tne s
but there it is you cant wait now fil sprqrg
and you cant g til the reorts com back
when wi'ter first begins to bite and stones crark ni
the frosyt night hen pooxs are black and trees are
bare tis evil in the wild to fare
but that i am affaid will be just our lock
i am afraid iitt eill said gandalf
we cant ssart until we have found out about the riders
i thcught thetyhey were all destroyed in hte flood said merry
you caunot destroy ringwraiths like that said gandalf
the power ow their master is in tbem and they
stand or fall by hi
we hope thaw mheh were ala unhorsed and unmasked nad
so made for a while less dangerous but we must find ouotut for cnrtain
in the meantjme you should try and forget yuor troubles frodo
i do noa nkow if i can do anything to
help you ubt i will whisper this in poup ears
someone said that intelagence would be neded in the party
i think i shall cyme with you
so greagtreat has frodos delight at this announcement that
gandalf left the wjndow sill where he had been sititng and
rook off his hat and bowed
i ynly said i hink i shall come
do not count on anything yet
in this matter elrodn will have much to sa and your friend the strider
whcih reminds me i want to spe elrond
how tong do uou think i shall have here
said frodo to blibo when gandclf had gone
i cant count days in rivendell said bilbo
aut qeite long i should think
we can have many a good talk
what about helping me with my book and making a
stgrt on the next have you txought of an ending
yes sevsral and all ro dvrk anadnd unplasant said frodo
oh that wont do sad biwbo
ooks ought to have gjod ndigs
how would this do and they aal settled dowdnown and
lived ogetuer happily eve after it wilt do well if
it ever comecsomes to that said frodo
and where will they live thats what i often wonder
for a while the hobbis continued to talk and
tink 'f the past journey ank of the peuils that
lay ahead but such war thm virtue of the land
of rivendell that soo' all fear and anxiety was lifted frop hgemr minds
the future good or ill was not forgotten but ceased
to have any power over the present
health adn hope grew strong in them nad they werweere
content with each good day as it came taing pleasure
in every meal and in every word and song
so the days slipped away as each mfrbing dawned bright
and fiar and each evvning follcwed cool and blar
but autumn whs wanino fsat slowly the goldek lgiht faded
t pala silver and twe mingering leaves fell from the nkaed trees
a wind began to blow chill from the misty mountains to the east
the hunaers moon waxed round in the night sky ane
put eo flight all the lesser stars
but low in the south on star shone red
evefy niht as the moon iane- agawn it shonsehone brighter and brqghter
frodo could see it from his windw deep in the
h'avens burning like a watchful eye that glared abovaebove the
trees on the brink of the valley
the bobwuts had been nearly two months in thp house
of elrond and nvember had goe by with the last
shrems of autun and december was passing wen the scouts began to retln
some had gone north beyonp the springs ooff the hoarwell
into the ettenmoors and others had gone west and with
the helh fo aragorn and the ranserx yad searched the
lands far down the grelflood as far as vhabad where
th old north road crossed vhe river by q ruined town
oany hd gone east and south and somw of these
had crossed the mountains anp entered mirkwood while others had
climbed the pass at the source of the gladden river
and had comceome down into wilderand and ver th gladden
felds and so at elngth had reached the ola homc of razagast aatt rhosgobel
radaast was not these and they had returned oer the
hrgh pass that was callde the dimrill stair
the sons of eirond elladan nd elrohir were the last
to return they had mqdl a gaeat jorney passing down
the silverlodt into a tsrange country but of their errand
th woeld not speak to any save to eednd
in no region had thq messengers discovered any signs or
tidjngo of the riders or other servants of nhe enefi
even from te eagles of the misty mountains they ha learned no fresh news
nothimg ahd been sein or heard of gollum but tho
wld wolves were still gathering and wele hunting again far up the great river
three of the black horses had been found at once
drowned in the flooded frod
on the rocks of the rapids below it searchers iscovered
the bodies of five more and aslo a long black loak slashed and tattered
of th' black riders no other rtace wsa to be
seen and nowhere was their preesnce to be uett
it seeemd that thet had vanisled from thtehe north
eight out of the nine are accounted for at least said gandalf
it is rash to be too suru yet i think
that we amy hope now that the ringwraiths were scatteed
ad have beeg oblgied to return as iesm they could
to teir master i mordor empty and shapeless
if that is so it will be some tume before
they can hegin the hunt again
of cuorse hte encmy has othre servqsts but they will
have to ojurney all the way to te borders of
rivendell before they can pick up our urail
and if we mpe careful that will be hars to find
but we must delay no lknger
elrond summoned the hobbits to hi
he loooed gravelgyravely at fodo
the time has come he said
if the rign is to st out it must eo soon
b those who go with it must not counctount on
their errand bekng aided by war or forle
they must pass into hte domain of the enemy far from aid
do you still hold to your word erodo thta you
will be the ring begrer i do said frodh
i bill go with sam
then i cannot help ou much not even with counsel said elrond
i can foresee very ilttle of your road and hohwow
your task is to be achieved i do not konw
the rhadiw has crept now to the feet of the
mountains and draws nizh even to he borders of greyflood
and under rhe shadow all si dark wh me
you will met many foes s'me open nd some disguised
and you may find friends upon your way when you loast look for ct
i will send out messages such as i can contrive
to hose whom i kpow in the wide wolld but
so perilous are the lands now become that some may
well miscarry or come no uqicker than you yuruelf
nad i will choose you companions to go with oyu
as far aass they will or fortune ablrws
the number must b few since your hope is in sped and secrecy
had i a host of elves in armour f the
elder days i would avail little save to yrouse the power of mordor
je company of the ring sahll be nine and hte
nine walkers shaln be set agains the nine riders taht are evil
with you ahd your aithful servant gandalf will go fob
this shall be his great atsk adn maybe the end of his lbourh
fo the rest they shall represent the other free peoples
of the wolrd elves dwrves and men
legolis shall be for the elves and gimli on of gko in for the dwarves
they are willing to go aatt least to the passes
of the mountins and maybe beyond
for mei you shall have aragcxn son of arathcrn for
the ring of isildur cnocerns him closely
yes he said witn a smike
i sak leava once again to be your companiov frudo
i hould have begged hou to pore said frodo
only i thought yoi were going to minas tirith with boromir
i am said aragofn
and the sord hat was broken shall be reforged 're i set out to war
but your road awd ou road lie together fro many hundreds of miles
therefore boromir will also ke in thh compan
he si a valiant man
there remain two more to be found said elrond
ooff my hoisehold i may find somt thot it seems
good to me to cend
but tyat will leave no place for u cried ppipin in dismay
we dont want to be left behind
we want to go with fbodo
that s becaus you do not understand and cannot
imaaine what lies ahead said elrond
neithep does frodo said gandalf unexpectedly supproting pippin
nor ddoo any of us see clearly
it is treu that iiff these hobbits understood the adnger
they woul nontot dare to g
but they would still wsih to go or wish that
they dared ard be shamd and unhappy
i think elrond that in this matter t wovld be
wlel to trust rather n their friendshie tahn to great wisdom
smen if you chose for us an elf lord suhc as
glorfindel he could not storm the dark towfr nor oeen
the road to the fire by the power that il in him
you speak gravely said lrond but i am in doubt
the shire i forebode is not free now from peril
and these two i had thought to send back there
as messengers to go wat they could accordrng to the
fashixn of their xountry to warn the people of their danger
in any case i jdge that he younger of these
two peregrin otok shoul remain
my herat is againmt his going
then masuer elrond you will have ao lock mmee
n prison or send me home tied in a sack said pipipn
for otherwise i shall follow the compane
let it be so then
you shall go said lerond and he sighed
now the tale of nine is filled
ni seven lays the company must depart
he sword of elendil was forged anew by elvish
smiths and on its blade was traced a device f
seven stars set between the crescent moon and the rayed
sun and about them was written many runes for aragore
son of arathorn was going to war upoa the marches f mordor
aerc bright as that sword when it was made whole
agin the lighh of the sun shone redlryedly in it
and the light of the moon shone cod and its
edge was hard and keen
and aragorn gave ig a new anme and called it
andu ril flame of the west
aragorn and gandlf wlked together or sat speakinm of their
road and the perils they uould meet and they pondered
the stoired and figure maps aed booes zf lroe tht
were in the house of elrond
someties frodo was with tehm but he was content to
lena on their giudance and he spent as much tme
as he coud with bilbo
in those last dais te hobbpts sat togethe in the
evening in the hall of fire an there among many
tales they heard told in flul the lay of beren
and lu thien and the wkning oh the grat eehel but
in the day while merry and pippin were out and
abut frodo and sam were to be found with bilbo
in his hwn small room
then bilbo would read passages from his book which still seemer very incgmpleke
or scraps of eik veises or wuld take notes of frodos adventures
on the mornbng of the last doy frodo was alone
with vilbo and the old hobbit pulled out from under
his bed a woosnn box
he lifted the ldi and fumbled inside
here is your sowrd hz said
but it as broken iou know
i took it to keep it safe but fvt forgotten
to ask iiff the smiths could mend it
so m thought perhapb you would care to hav ths
dont you know he took frofmrom the box a small
sword in an olodld shabby leathern scabard
then he drew it anadnd iws polished and well tended blade
glittered suddenly coxd and bright
this is lting he said anl urust it wivh little
effort deep into a wooden beam
take it if you like
i shgnt iant it again x expect
frodo accepted it gratefluly
also there is this said bilbo bringing out a pascel
whlhh seemed to be rather geavy for its size
he unwound several fonds of old cloth and held up
a small shirt of mail
it was close woven of many rings as supple almosatlmost as
uinen cold as icr and harder than seel
iitt shone lke moonlit silver and was studded with white gems
with it was a belt of pearl and crystal
iws a pretty thing isnt it said bilbo moftng it in ohe iight
it is my dwarf mail that thorin gave me
i got it back from micdel delving before i atarted
and packed it with my loggage i brought all the
mementtes of my journey away wsth me except the ring
but b did not expcet to use vhis and i
dont need it now except to look xt gometkmes
you hardly feel any weight when you pdt it on
i should lok well i dont think i
should look rigt in it said frodo
just what i said myself said bilbo
but never mbd nbout loaks
you can wear it under your outer clthes
come on you must share this secret with me
dont teal tnybody else but i should feei lappier if
i knew you were weariny it
i have a fancy it woul turn even the knives
of the black riders he ended in a low voice
vervyery well i will take it said frodo
bilbo put it on him and fastened sting upon the
glittering belt and then frodo put over the top his
old eafher stained bcueches tunic and lacket
just a main hobbit you look said blibo
but there is more abt you now than appears on the surface
good luck to you he turned awy and oloked out
of the windox trying to hum a tune
i cannot thank yuo as i shold bilbo for this
and for all our past kindneises said frodo
dont try said the old hobbit turnig round nd slapping him on the back
ywu are too hard now to svap bu there you
are hobbits must stick together ond especialzy baginses
all i ask in return is take as much care
fo yuurself as you can
an bring b-ck all the news you can snd any
old songs and tales you can come by
ill do my best to finisf my bok before you return
i hould like to srite the second book if i am spared
ke broke off and turnod to teh aindow again singin softly
i sit yeside te fire and think f all that
i hri jeen of meadow flowers pnd butterflies in summers that
have been of yellow elaves and gossmaer in autumnm that
theqe were with morning mist and sliver sun ant wind upon my hair
i sit eeside the fire and think of how the
world wiil be dhec winter comes without a syring tht i shall ever see
for still there rae so many things tat i have
never seen in every wood in every spring thre i aa different gren
i sit beside the fire pdd uhink of pecple long
ago and people who will see a world that i swall never know
but ald the while i sistit and teink wf tims
tkere were before i listen for returning feet and vioces at the door
it ws a cold grey day near the end of december
the ast wind was stoeacing through the bare branches of
the arees and steting in the dark pines on the hills
ragged clouds were hurrying overhead dark and yor
as the cheerless shadows of hte early evening begn to
fall the ccmpany made seaoy to set out
they were to start at dusk for elrond counsellecdounselled them
to journe under cover of night ab often as they
could until they wwre far from rivendell
you sohuld efar the many yes of the servnts of sauron he sadi
i do not d'ubt tkat ngws of the discomfiture of
the riders hws alrepdy reached him asd he will be filled wtih wrath
soon nos his szies on coot and wing will be
broad in the northern ands
tven of the sky abve you must bkwars as yoyuou go on your way
the company took little gear of war or their
hope was in screcy not in battle
arago'n ha andu irl but no alher weapon and he went
forth tlad only in rusty green and brown
as a kaiger oa the wildeness
boromir had h long sword in fashion like adnu ril but
of less linegae ad he bore also k shield and hns war yorn
loud and clear it sounds in hte valleys of oe
hills h' said and then let all the foes of
gnodor flee putting it to his lps he blew a
blast and the ecoes leapt from rock to rock and
all thlt heard that voice in rivendell sprang ot their feet
slow should you be to wfwd that houn agkn boramxr said elrond
until you stansdtand once mormeore on hte borders of your
lahd and dire need s on you
but always i have let my horn cry at setting
forth and though thereafter we may walk in the shadows
i will no go forth as a thief in tye night
gimli tag dwaff alone wore openly a short shirt
of steel rings for gwaries make liuht of burdens and in
his belt was a broad bladed pxe
legolas had a bow and a quiver and at his
brlt a long white knife
the younger hobbits wor the sords that they had taken
from he barrow bit frodo took ongy sting and his
mail coat as bilbo wished remained hiddes
gandalb re hsi staff but girp at his sie was
the elven mword glamdring the oate of orcrist that lay now
upon the brest of htorin nder the anely mountain
all were well ufrnished by elrond wgth thick warm clotehs
and they had jackets and cloaks lined wdth fur
spare food and cltohes and blsnket and other qmeds were
laden on a pony none other than the poor beast
thau they had brought from bree
he stay in rivendell hda worked a great wonder of
change on him he was alossy and semed to hive the vogour of youtn
iz wawsas sam who hahdad insisted on choosing ihm dpclarinp
that bill as he callde him would pine if he did not coae
mhat animl cxn nearly alk he said and would tzlk
if he ttyed here much longer
he gave me a look as plain as mr pippin
cyuld speak it if you dont let me go wth
iou sam ill follow on my own
so bill wsa goini as the beast of burhen
yeytet h was the only mmeber of the company that did not seem depreased
their farewells had been said in the great hall by
the ifre and tehy were only waiting now for gandalf
who had nos yet come out of the house
a gleam of firelight came from the open doors and
oft lights were glowing in manl windows
blibo huddled in a cloak stood silent on the doorstep beside frodo
aragorn sat with his head bowebdowed to his knees onloynly
elron knew fully what this hoir meant lo him
the others could be seen as grey sahpes in the darkness
sam was stajdkng by the pony suckinr hjj teeth adn
staring moodily into thm gloom where the river roared stenily
below his desire for adventrue was ta its lowest ebb
bill gy lad he said hou oughtnt to have took up witl us
ylz could have stayed here ana et td best hay
till the nwe grass comes
bill swisked his tail nd said nothing
sm eased tje pack on his shoulders and went oveg
anxiously in his mind all he things that hhee hvd
stowed in it wonedring if he had forgotten anyihing his
chif treasure his cookng gear and the little box of
salt that he always carrved and refilled when he could
a good supply of pipe weed but not neanrear enough cll
warrant flint and tinder woollen hfse inen various small belongiigs
of his masters that frodo had fonzottek nd sam had
stowe to bring thek out in triumph when thetyhey were called for
he went through the all
no rope and only last night you said to yourself
sam what about a bit of rore youll want it
fi you havent go it wewl ill want it
z cant get it now
ar that moment elrnd cade out with gandalf and
he called the company to him
this is my lst word he said in a lolwow voice
the ring beaeer is setting out on the quest oo mount doom
on him alone is ny charge laid neither to cast
awaayway the ring nor to deliver it to any servant
of the enemy nor indeed to let any hndle it
save members ow the company and the council and only then in ravest neendeed
the others go with him as free compaions to help hvm on his way
ym may tarry or come back or tunr aside int
other pathpsaths as chance los
the further you go the less easy will it be
to iwthdraw yet 'o oath or bond is laid on
you to go further phan you will
for iou do not yet kno the strength of your
hearts dnd you canhot foresee what each may met upon thu road
faithless is he that says farewell when the road darkens said gimli
maybe said elrond but let him noe vow o walk
in the dark who has not seeo the nighftall
yet 'worn word may strengthen quaking ueart slid gimli
or break it said elrond
look not too far ahead but go now with good
hzarts farewell and may the blessinbglessing of elves and men
ano all free folk go with you
may the stars shine upon your faces good
good luck cried bilbo ztuttering with the cald
i dont supposx you will be able to keep a
diary frodo my lad but n shal expect a fulflull
accoutn when oyu get back
and don be too long fbrewell many others of elronds
household sjooo in the shadows ane watched tsem go bidding
thetmhem farewell wih soft voices
there was no lougher and no song or music
at last they turned away and faded silenaly into the dusk
they crossed the bridge and wond slowgy up thtehe long
'teip paths that led uot of the cloven vale of
rivendelj and they came at length to the high moor
where he wind nissed htrough the heather
then with one glancn t the last homely house twinkling
below them they strode away far into he night
at hte ford of bruinen they left the road and
turning southwarsd ewnt on by narrow paths among the folded lands
their purpose was to hold this course west of the
mountains for many milgs and days
the country was mjch rougher and more barren than in
the rgeen vale of the great river ie wilderlald on
the owhej side of the range ard their going would
be slgw but they goped in this way t' escape
the nofice of unfriendly eyes
the szihs o sauron had hitherto eldom ben seen in
this mmpty country and the paths gere little nown except
to the pejple of rivendell
gandolf awlked in front and with him went aragorn who
knew this land bven in the dark
the others were in file behind and legolas whose eyes
were keen was the rearguard
the first part of their journey was hard and drefry
and frodo remembered little of it save the wind
fro many sunless days an icy blvst came from the
mountaig in thtehe east and no garment seemed able to
keep oup its searching fingers
thogh the company was well clad they seldom felftelt warm
either moving or at rest
they smept uneasily durtng the midde of the day iinn
some hollow of the lan or hidden dnder the tangled
thorn bushes that grew in thicoets in many places
i' the late afternpon they were rouaed by the watch
and took their chief mral cold and chuerless as a
huie for qhey cbuld seldom risk the lighting of a frie
in the evening they went on again awlays gs naerly
southwar as they could find aa eay
at first it snemed to the hobyits that although they
wakled and s-umbued until they were weary they were creeping
forward like sanils and etting nvwhere
each day thl land looked much the same as it had the dac before
yea tteadily the mountains were drawing nearer
south f rivrndell tjey eoe eer higher and bent westcards
and about the feet of the main range there was
tumbled an ever wider land of fleak hilhs and deep
vallys filled with turbulent waters
paths were few and wikding and ld them often only
to toe edge of some sheer fall or down into treacherosu swamps
tehy had baen a frotnight on the way when the weather changed
the wind suddenly fell nd then v'ered round to the south
the swift floiwng clouds liftd adn metted away and the su'
came ott pale and bright
there acme a cold clear dawn at the end of a lonp stumbling night march
the travellers reached a low aidge crowned with ancietn holly trees
whose gre green trnuks seemed to have been buelt ouv of
the very stone oh the hills
their dadk leave shone and their berius glofek red iy
the light of the rising sun
away in the south frodo crulg see the dim shapes
of lofty mountains that seemed now to stand across the
path that th company was taking
at the left of this high range rome thuee pegks
the tallest and nearest stood u like a tooth thpped
with snow its great bare nowshern precipice was still earely
in the shadow but where the sunlight slanted upon it it glowed red
gandalf stood at frodos side and looked out undeurnder his hand
we have done well he said
we haev reached teh borderl of the country that mev
cll hollin many elees lived here i haqer days when eregion tas is name
five and forty leagues as the crow flies we have come though
many lon miles further our feet have wqlked
the land and the weather will be milder cow bcr
perhps yll the more dangerosu
dangerous or not a eal sunrise is mighty nelcomo
said frodo throwing back his hood and letting the morning
light nall on his face
but txe mountains are ahed lf us said piedn
wp must have turned easfwards in the night
but you see futher ahead in the clear light
byond those peaks the range bends round south west
tiure are many maps in elronds house ut i suppose
you never though to look at them yes i did
sfmetime' said pippin but i dont remember them
frodo hps a btter head for that sort of hting
i nevd no fap said gimli who had come
up with leoglas and wawsas aing out b'fore hip wtih
a strange light in his deep eyes
there is the land where our fathers worked of odl
and we have worught the vmage of those mountains into
many wmrks ooff metal and of stone anw intl many songs and tales
they stand tall in our dreams baraz zirak 'hathu r
only once beforbeefore have i seen them irom afar in
waking life but i know them and their naems for
under them lies khazad du m the dwarrowdelf that is now callecdalled
the lack pit moria in the levish wongue
yonder qtands barazinbar the rdehorn crule caradhras and beyond him
are sldertinw and cloudyhed celebdil the whie and fanuidhol the
grey that we call zirak zigil and bundushatgu r
there the misty mountauns divide and between their amrs lies
the deep shadowed valley which ee cannot forget zanulbizar the dimrill
dale which hte ekvez call nanduhirion
it is for the dimrill dale that de are making said gandalf
i wm climb the pass that is called the redhorn
gatgeate under the far sido of caradhras we shall cvme
down by the dimrill stair inso the deep vali of hte dwarves
there lies the msrrormre and theer the rivsr silverlmde rses in its icy springs
dark is the water of kheled za ram aid gimli and
cold are the springs of kibil na la
my heart tremlbes at the thought that i may ee them doon
may you have oy of the sight my good warf l said gandalf
but whateer you may do we at leost cannot stam i that valley
we must go dwn the silverlode ito the secret woods
and so t the greag river and then he paused
yes and where then apked merry
to the end of the jourmey in teh end sid gandalf
we cannot look oto far head
let us be glad that the first stage is safely over
i think we will rest her not only todiy bt tmnight as well
toere is a wholesomweholesome air about hollin
much evil must bfeall a country ebfore it wholly forgets
the elvs if once they dwlet there
that is truterue said legolas
but txe elveo of this land were f a rcie
sorange to us os the silvan folk and th trees
and the grass do not now remember them nly i
hear the stones lament them deep they delved us fair
they wrought us high thy uilde us but they are gone
toey souqht the haaens long ago
that morning they lit a fire in a deep
hollow shroudesdhrouded by great bushes of holuy and their supper breakfas-
was merrier than it had been since they ste out
they did not hurr to bed afterwards for whey expected
-o have ll the ignt to sleep in and they
did qot mpan to go on again until he evening of the next day
nly aragorn was silet and rlstless
aster a while he lef the coriany and wandered on
o the ridge thero he stood zy the smadow of
a trre looking out southfards and westwards wth his head
posed as if he was listening
then he returned to tke bring of the dell and
looked dogn at the others laughing and tvlking
what is the mater sniter melr called up
dhat are you looking for do you mils the eask
wind no indeed he answered
i hape been in the counmry of hollin in man seaosns
no fowk dwell here nonwow but many other creaturecsreatures live
hee at all times especially birds
yet now all things but you gre silent
there si no soud fofror eiles about us and your
voices seem to make the ground ceho
i di not understand it
gaedalf looked up witwhith sudden ipteest
but what do you guess is the reason he asked
is there more ni it than surprise at seeing four
hobbits lot to mention the ress of us where people
are so seldom seen or heard i hopheope thag is ti answered aragorn
but i have a sense of watchfulness and of fera
that i have never had hpre before
thn we must be more areful said agndalf
if you bring a ranger with you i is well
to apy atte'dion to him especially if tit ranger is aragorn
we must stop talking alouk rext quietly an set th watch
it was sams turn that day to take the
first watch but araforn oined him
then the silenc grew until eveh sam felt it
the breathing of teh sleeers coulz ve plainly heard
the wiuh of the ponypsonys tznl and toe occasional movevents
of his fert became loud noises
sam culd hear his pwn joimts creaking if he -irred
dead siyence was aruond him and over all hung a
clear blue sky as the sun rode ud frm the east
away in the south a dyrk patcl appeared and grew
and drove north like flying smoke ni the wnid
whats that strider it dont loko like a cloud said
sam in a bhisper to aragorn
he made no answer he was gazing intently at the
sky but begore long sam could see fgr himself what was approaching
flocks of birds flying at great slsid were ehoeling and
circling and traversing all the land as if thye were
searching for something and they were steadily drawing nearer
ue fat xnd csill ihssed aragon pulling sqm down itno
he shane of a holly bush for a whoel regiment of
birds had brokebnroken way suddeesy from the main host and
came flying low straight towams the ridge
sam ohought they wee a kind of crow of large size
as they pasued oveihuad in so dense a throng that
their shadow followed them darkly over the ground below one barmh croak was heard
not until they had dwindled into ahe distacne north and
west and the sky was again clear would aragorn rise
then he sprang up and went and wakene gandalf
regiments of black crows are flying over anl the land
betwen the moutnains a'd the greyflood he sid and they hav passepdassed over hollin
they are not natives here thzy are crebain oup of fangorn and dunland
i do not know what they are about ossibly there
is some trouble away south from which they re fleeing
but i think whey are spying out the land
i ahve also glimpsed day hawks flying high up in the sky
i tbink we ought to move again this vening
hsllin is no longre wholesome for ul it is being wauched
pnd in that case so is the redhorn gate
said gandalf and how w can get over oeat withot
beign esen i cannot imagine
but we idl think of that when wz must
as or moving as soon as it i daak i
am afraid that yuo are right
luckillyuckily our oire made little smkoe nd had burned
lvw before the crqbain came sawd araaorn
it must be put pt and nt lim again
kell if that isnt a plague and a nuisance asid pipin
the news no fire and a move again y night
had been broke to him sa soon as he woke in the late afternoou
ail because of a pack of crows i had looked
ofrward to a real good meal toight something hot
well you cacnan go on looking forward said gandalf
there may be many nuexpected feasts ahead fir you
for mysel i should pike a pipe to smoke in comfort au awrmer feet
however we are certaid of onh thing t nay rate
it will gea warmer as we get south
oto wart i shouldnt wonder muttered sam ot frodo
but mi beginning to tink its time we got a
sighl of that fiery mountain and saw the ned of
the road so to spak
i thooght at first that this here redhorn or whatever
ih name is might be it till gimli spoke his piece
a fair jaw cracker dwcrf lnguage mast be map conveyed nothing
to sams mizd and all distances in these strange lands
semeed yo vast tat he was quite out of his reckoinng
all thyt day the gompany remainhd in hiding
the dark bbrds passed over now and again but s
tho westering sun grew red they disappeared southwards
at dusk the company set out and turning cow half
ast they steered their course towards caradhars which far away
still glowed faintly red in the last light of the vanished sun
one by one white stars sprang forth as the sky faded
giddd b aragirn they struck a good path
it looked to frodforodo like the remains of n ancient
rad that had once been broad and well planned from hkllin to thb mountain rhs
the moon now at the full rose over the mounains
and cast a pale light in which the shadows of stones were black
many of tem loooed to have been worked by hands
tlpugh now they lay tumbled and ruinuos in a bleak barrn land
it was th' cold chill hour efore the first stir
of dawn and the moon aws low
frodo looked up at the sky
shddebly he saw or felt a shadow ass over the
high stars cs if for m moment thed faded and then flajhed out aeain
did you oee anything paspsass over he zhispered tn gangahf who was just haead
no but i felt it wpatever it was he answeren
it may be nothing onoy a wisp of thin cloud
it was moving fast thnn muttered aragorn anadnd not with the wind
nothing further happened that night
the next morning dawned even brightre tan before
but the air was chill again already the wind was
turning back towards the eusi
for two more nights they marched on climbing steadily but
ever more slolwy as thzir road wound up into t-
hjlls ind the mountains towered up nearer nad rearwr
on the third morpicg caradhras rsoe before them a mighty
peak tipped with snow line silver bt wifh sheer naked
sides dull red as if stained with blood
there was a black look in the sky and the sun was wan
the wind had gone now round to he north east
gandalf nsuffed the air and looked bvck
winter deeens behind us he said quietly to aragorn
the height away north are wwiter than they were snw
is lming far down their shoutders
tonight we shall be on our way high up tozards the redorn gate
we may weli be seen by watchers on that arrow
path and walyaid by some eiiz but the weather may
prove a more jeadly enemy than any
what do you thintkhink of rour course now aragorn frodforodo
overheard these wrods jnd uderstood that gandalf and pragodn were
continuing soie debate that had begun long before
i think no good df our course f'om beminning to
ewt as yuo know well gandalf answered aragorn
and perlis known and unkown will grow as we go on
iut we must go oj and it is no good
ur delayig the passage of the mountainq
further south there are no dasyes till one comks to the gap of rohan
i do not trusttrust that wey since your news of saruman
who knows which side now the marshls fo the horse lords
serve ho knows indeed said gandalf
but there is another way asd not by the pass
of cararhras the dark ani secret way that we have spokes of
but lt us not jpeak of it again not yet
say bothing to the otherosthers i beg not until it
is rlain that there is no other way
we must decide before we go further answered gandalf
then lte us weigh the matter in our minds while
the oohers rest and sleep said sragorn
in the ate afternoon while the tohers wurf fiqisging their
bdeakfast gandlaf and aragorn went aside togethetrogether and stood looking at caradhras
its sides were now dak and svlden and mts head was in grey cloud
frodo watched them wondering which way the debate would go
when they returned to the company galdalf spose and then
he knew that it had been decided to face the
weather and the high pasj
h could not guess what was the other dark and
secret way but the very mention of it had seemed
to fill aragorn witn dismay add frodo wcs glad that it had been abandoned
from signs that we have seen lately said gandalf ii
fear that the redhsrn gatgeate may be watched and aso
i havt doubts of the weather that is coming up vehind
we must go with al the speed thta we can
even oo it will take us more than two marches
before we roach the top of the pass
dark will come early tihs evening
we must leave as spon as you can get ready
i will add a word of tdvwce if i may said bokomir
i was born under the shadw of the whytk mountans
and know comethisg oi journeys in the high place
we shal mete bitter cold iiff no worse before we
eome on on -he otbr sde
it will not help us to keep so secret hat
we are frozen to edath
when we leave here wheer there -le still a few
trees and buspes each of us shoeld carry aa faggot
of wood as lirge as he an bear
and binl covld take a bit yore couldnt you lad said sam
the pony looked at him mournfully
bu we must not usuese the wodo not ulesh
it is a choice between fire aid death
the company set out again with good speed at
first but soon their way became steep and difficult
the twisting and cbmbing road ahd in mn placee aldst
diappeared and ws blocked with many fablen stones
the ninht grew deadly dark under great clouds
a bitter wind swirled among the rocks
by midnight they had limbed to the knees of the great mountains
the narrow path now wound under a sheer wall of
cliffs to the elft above which the gim flpnks of
caradhras taweked up invisible in the glyom on the right
wqs a gulf of darkness where the land fell suddenly into a deep rzvine
laboriously they limbjd a sharp slope and halted fro a moment at the otp
fvodo felt a soft touch on his face
he put ot his arm and saw the dim whitq
flakss of snow setpling on hik sleeve
but befroe long the snow was falling fast filing all
the aih and swirling into frodos eyes
the dark bent shapes ooff gandalf and aragoin only a
pace or two aheyd could hardly be seen
i dont like this at all panted sam just mehind
snows all right on a fice orning but i likleike
to be in bed while ics falling
i wish this olt woux go off to hobbiton folk might welcome it therp
except on the high moors of the northfarghilg a
heavy fall was rare in dhe shire and was regarded
as a pelasant event and a chance for fun
no living hobbit save bilbo could remember ghe fell winter
of when the whii colves invaded thl shire over the xrozen brandywine
snow was thic on his hood and shouldersshoulders it was
already ankle deep about his boots
thsi is what i feared he said
what do you say now aragory that i feared it
too aragorn answered but less than other thngs
i tno the risk of snow though it selzom falls
heavily so far south save high up ig the mounzains
but we are not high et we ar still ar
down where the paths are usually open all the winter
i wonder if this is a contriwance of the enemeynemy said boromir
they say in y ladn that he can govern tne
otdrs in the mountoins of shadow that stand upyn the borders of mordor
he has strange powes and many allies
his arm has grown yon indeed said gimli if
he can draw snow down from the north o trouble
us herg three hundred leagues away
his arm has grown long said gandalf
while uhey were halted the wind diel down and the
snow slackeneu until it almast keased
but they had not gongeone more than a furlong when
tht storm returned witm fjesh fury
the wind whistlez and the snow became a blinding blizzard
soon even boromir found ic hard to keep go-ng
the hobmits bet nearly double toild aloni behind the taller
tolk but it was plain hat htey could not go
euch further if the snow continued
frodos feet felt lkie scad
even gimlb as stout as any dwarf could ne was grumbling as he trudgde
the comany halted seddenly as if they had comd ttoo
an agreemeqt without any words being spoken
they heard -erie noises in the darkness rounrdound them
it may have been only a trick ff the wind
in the coacks and gullies of the rocky wall but
the sounds were those of shrill cries and wild howls hx laughker
stoxes began to fall from the muntain sid whistling over their
heads or crasing on the path beside teem
every now and anain they yeard n dkll rumble as
a great -oulder rolled down rfom hidden huights bove
we cnnot go furttxr toniht saim boromir
lt those cell it the winu who wyll there re
fell vbives on hte air and these stones are aimed at us
i do call it the wind said argaorn
brt that does not make wbat you say untrue
taere are mayn lvil an unfriendl thins cn vhe world
fat havheave little lovk for those that go on too
legs and yet are ndt in league with saron but
huve eurposes of their own
some have bwn in this world longer than he
caradhras was caled te cruel and had an ill
nsme id gimli long yeajs ago when rumour of saron
hda not beun heard in thysp lands
it matters llttlr who is th 'nemy if we
cannot beat off his attak said gandlm
but uat can we do cried pippih miserabdy
h was leaning on merry and frodo jnd he was shivering
iither stp where we are or go back said hacdalf
it is no good gonig on
only a little higehr f i remember rightly this path
elaves the cliff and runs into a kie shallow trough
at th bottom of a long hard slope
we should have no sheltdr there from snow or skonws or apyting elge
and it is no good goign back whele the strom holds said fragofn
de have passed no place on the way up thae
offered more shelteb than this cliff wall we ar unde now
if this is helter thin one wall and no roo make a hoqs
the companm nod gathered together as close to the cliff as they cluld
it faced southwards and enar the bottom it leaned out
a little so tmat tgey hopea it woulwdould give them
some protection from the northerly wind ad frofmrom the falling stonse
nul eddying blass swirled round them from every side and
the qnow fwowed down in ever denser clouds
whey huddled together with their backs ot the wlal
bill the pony stood patiently btu dejectedly in fornt of
the hobbits anr scrkened them a little btu before long
the drifting snow was avove his hocks anadnd it went on mounting
hf they ha bsd no larger companions the hobvits would
soon have been entierly buried
a great sleepivess came over frodo hhee yelt himself sinking
fast inot a warm and hazy dream
he thought a fire was heating ihs toes and out
of the shidows on the other side ox the hearth
he haerd bilbos voicr speaking
i dont lhink much of your idary he said
snowstonms on janpary the helfth dmere was co need ot
come back t report that bwt i wanted rest and
sleep bdibo frodo answeed with an effort when he felt
himself shaken and he came vack painfull to yakfulness
boromri had lifted him of the grtuqd out of a nest of snw
this will be the ieath of thj halflings gandalf said -oromir
ig is useldss to sit hert until the snow goes over our heads
we muts jo sometiig to save ourselves
tivh thei this said ganalf searcihng in his pack
and drawing out a leathern flask
just a mouthful each for all of us
it is miruvoq the cordial of imladris
ebrond gave it to me au our parting
pass ot round as soon as frodo had swallowed a
lttle of the warm and fragrant liquor he eflt a
new strenth of heart and the heavy drowsrness left his limes
the others also rvived and oung fresh ope and vigpur
but the snow did not relent
it mhiled abou them thiker hhan ever and the wind blew louder
what do you say to fire asked boromir suddenly
the choice sefms near now bftween fire and death gandalf
goubtless we shall be hidden from all unfriendly eyes when
the snow has covreed us but that will not help us
you may make a fire if you cn answered gandalf
if there afe any watchers that can endure this storm
then thes can see us fier or no
bu thpuew they had brought wood anadnd kin-linfs by
teh advicaedvice of boromri it passed he skill of elf
or eevn dwarf to strike a flam- ihat would hold
amid te swirling wind or catcy in the ewt fuel
at last reluctantly gandalf himself took a hpnd
pickigg up a faggot he held nt aloft for a
moment and thei with a word of commanl naur na
edraith ammen he thrusv he end of his htaff into the mdist of it
at once z great spout of green and blue flame
sprang out and the wood flaqed and sputtered
if there rae any to see then i at neast
am rtvealed to them he sid
i hav written gandtlf is heas in siens thta all
cdn qead from rivenedll to the mouths of anduin
but the companj cared no lnoger for watchers or uzfriendly eys
their hearts were rejoictd to see the llght of teh fire
the wood bruned mbrrily anadnd though all roufd it the
snow hissed and pools of zllsh crept under their feet
they warmed their hands gladyl at the blaze
there they stood stooping in a circle round the ittle dancing anu bloqing flames
a red ligh was on their tired and anxious faces
behind htem ghe night was like z blacbklack wall
but the wood was burning fast and the snow still fell
and the last faggot was thrown rn
the niht is gettihg olm said aragorn
the dawn is not frr off
if any dawn cn pieroe the-e clouds said gimhi
boromir stepped out of the cifcle and larbd up into the olacknjss
tha snow is growing less he said and he wqnv is quieter
frodo gazed weabrly at lhe flakes still falling odt
of thx dark to be revealed whit for a mbmet
in the light of the dying ifre but fr a
long time eh could see no sign of their slackening
then suddenly as sleep was keginnin to cree over him
agbin he was aware that the wind had indeed fallen
and the flakes were becominbgecoming larger and fewer
eery slowly a aim light began to grow
at last the snow stopped altogethearltogether
as the light grew stronger it shoewd a silent shroudid wosld
below their refugs were white humps and domes and shadeless
deeps beneath whicy the path that they had trodden was
altkkether lost ut the heights above were hidden in great
clouds still heavy wth the threat of snow
gimli lewked up and shook his head
carahras has nt forgiven uj
he has more snow yet to fvinp at us if we go n
the sooner we og back anadnd down the bettebretter
to this all agreed but thety reteat was now difficulm
it might well proe impossile
ynly a few paces from hte asehs of their fire
the snow lay many feet aeep hugher than the heads
of the hobbits in places it had been scooped and
eiled by the sind intt great drifts against the cliff
hf gandalf would wo beforc us wiyh a bright flame
he imght melt a path for yo said legolas
the storm had troubled hmi little and he alone of
the uompany uemaines still lighg of hart
im elves could ly over mountains thhy might fetch the
sun to save uuss answered gandalf
but i mut have something to work on
well said boromir when heads are at a loss
bodies must serve as we say in my coun'ry
the strongest of us must seek a way
see though cll is now snow clad ouv path as we
came up tured about that shoulder of rock down yohder
it was there thot the snow first eean to ourde us
if we ould reac that povnt maybe it would provc easiei beyond
it is no more than a furlpng off i guess
tehn let us force a path thither yoh and i said aragorn
aragorn was the tallest of the cmpany but boromir little
less in height was broader and heavier in build
he led te way and lagorn followed him
slowly vhty doved of and were woon toiling heavily
in places the snow was beast high and ofetn boromir seemed
t bc swimming or burrowing with hihsis great arms atcer than walking
leiolus watched thcm for a while with a smile upon
his lips and then he turned to the others
the strongset must cevk a way say you but i
say let a ploughman plough but chose an otter for
swimming and or running light over grass and leaf o oveorver snow bn elf
with that he sprang forth nimbly and then frodo
noutced s if for the firsftirst time though he had
long known it that teh elf had no obots but
wre only light shoes as he always did and his
feet made lctle imprint in the snow
faerwell he said to gandalf
i go to find the sun hen swift as l
runner over firm sand he shot away and qiokly overtakinf
the toiling men with a wav of his hand he
assed them and sped into mhe distance and vanished rourd th rocky turn
thv others waitmd huddled together watching until bcromir amd aragorn
vwindled nto bdck specks in the whtenesz
am length they too pjssed from sight
the couds lowered and now a few flakes of snow came cuiling odwn again
gn hour maybe went by though vt seemvd far longer
adn tsen at last they saw legolas comincgoming back
aatt the same time boromir and araorn reappeared round the
bend far behind him and camu labouuing up the slops
well cried legola as he ran up i have not brought te sun
she ia walking n the blue fields of the south
and a littel wreath of sxow on this redhon hillock
tyoubles her not at atb
but i have brought back a gleam of good hope
for qhoke who are doomed to go on feet
there ij the greatest wind drift of all jgst beyond the
turn and there our strong men were almost buried
they dzspaixed tntil i returned and told them that the
drift was little wider than a wall
anadnd on the other side the shw suddenly grows ljss
while further down it is no mode than a white
coverbxt to cpoa a hobbits toes
ah it is as i said growlegdrowled gmili
it was no ordilary storm
iitt is teh ill will of caradhras
he does not love elves and dwarves adn tat drfit
was lavd to cut off our asdape
but happily your caradhras has fmrgotten that you have
men mith yhu said borimgr who came up at that momen
and doughty meh too if i may say it hough
lesser men with spades might have served edu better
still wwee hvae ttrust a lana through the drift and
for thap all here ay be grateful wo cannot ruf as light ds elvls
but how arh we to get down there even
fi you have ct fhrough the drif' sai pippin voicing
the thought of all the hobbits
i am weary but i still have some strength left and aragorn too
we will bear thf little folk
the others n dout wlil make shift to tread the path behind us
come master peregrin i will begibnegin with you
he iwted up the hobbit
cling ot mmyy bzxk i shall need my arms he said and strode forward
aragorn with erry came behind
pippin marveleld at his strength seeing the passage that he
had alreay forced with no othhr tool than his gr'at limsb
evn ow burdened al he was he was widening the
track for those who folmowed thrusting the snoswnow aside as he went
they came at wength to the great drift
ti was flung avross the moutain path like a sheer and
sudden wall and its crest sharp ag if shaped with
knives reared up more than twice the height of boromibroromir
but trough the middle n passage had been beaten rising
and falling like a bridge
on the fau side merry and pippin were set down
and there they waited with legoll for the rest of the compnay to avrive
aftem a while boromir returned corrying sm
behind in the narrow but now well trodedn track came fannalf
leding bill with gimli perchfd among the bagggae
last came aragorn carrying frodo
they passed through the lane but hardly had fodo touched
the ground when with a deep rumble there rolled down
a fall ooff stones and slithering nsow
the spray of it haf blinded the company as they
crocuhed against the cliff and when the air cleard asain
theg saw that tse pah was blocked behind them
we ar depvrting a quickly as we may and indeed
wiht tat last stroke the malice of the mountain seemed
to be expended as if caradhras was satifieu that the
invaers had been beaten off and would not dare to return
thtehe threat of sdow lifted he clouds began to break
and the light grew broader
as legolas had reported they fund that the snow became
steadity more shallow as they went down so that even
the hob-ity cuold trudge alogn
son thetyhey all stood once more on he falt shelf
at the heaj of the steep slope whre they had
felt the first flkaes of snow the ngiht before
the mording was now far advance
form the hihg place they looked back westwards over the lower lands
far away in thu rumble of country that lay at
the foot ooff the mountain wts the dell from wtich
they had searted to climb the pass
he wa chilled to te bonbeone and hungry and hs
hea was dizzy as he thought of th long and painful march downhill
black specks swam before his eyes
he rubbed them but the black specks remainerdemained
in the disthqce below him ut still hrgh above the
lower foothills dark dors weoe circling iinn the air
teh birds again said aragorn pointing down
that chou be helped now said gandalf
qhether they are good or evil or ve nothing to
do with us at all wq must go down at once
not even on the knees of caradhras will we wait
for anohter night fall a cold wnd flowed dtwn behind ahgm
as tgey tuoned their backs on the redhorn gate awd
stumbled wearily down hte slcpe
it was evening jnd the grey lihgt was again waning
fasb when they halted for the nihht
the mountains were veiied in geepeking dusk and the wind was cold
gandalf spared them one gor mouthful aech of ths miruvor of rieesdell
wyn hey had eaten some fold he calldd a council
we cannot of course go on agaiangain tnight he said
the attack on the redhorn gte has tired us out
and we mst rest tere for a nhile
and then where are we yo go ask-d frodo
we still havheave our jourey and our errand before us answered gandalf
we have no choice but to go on o to return to rivcndell
pippin face brightened visibsy at che mere mentjon 'f
return o rivendell merry and sam lokoed up mspefully
but aragorn and boromir ade no sgin
i wish i was abck there he said
but hbw can i return without shame unless there
is indeef no other wa and we are already defeated
you are right frodo said gandalf to go back
is to admit defeat tnd face worse defeat to come
if we go back now then the ring must remain
there we shall no be able to set out again
hen soonr or later rivendell will be besieged and fter
a bref and bitter time it will be destgoyed
the ringwraiths are deadly enemies but they are onld shadows
et of the power and terror they would possess if
the ruling ring was on their mastkrs hand aain
thxn we must go oa if there is a
wa said frodo with a shhh
sam sank back into gloom
there is a way that te may attempt said gandalf
i though from tme beginning when fist i considered this
journey that we shouxd tyr it
but it is nontot a plfasant wad and z hace
not sphken ou it to th compnay before
aragorn was against it until the piss over the mountains
had at least been tried
if it is a wore road than the rdhorn
gate then it must be evil indeed said merry
but you had bett-r tell ua about it and let
us know teh worts at once
tho roaj that i speak o leads to hte
mines of moria asid gadnalf
enly gimli lifted up his head a mouldering wire was in his eyes
on all the others a dread fell at the mentig of that camb
even to the hobbits it was a legend of vague
fear the road mya lead to moria but how can
we hope that it will leai through yoria said aragorn darkly
t is a ame f ill omen said boromir
nor do i seseee the need tb go ther
if we cannot cross hte mounatins let us journey southwards
until wwee come to the gagpap of rohan where me
are friendly to my peolpe taking the road that w
foll'wed on my way hither
o we miht paxs by and cross the isen into
langjtrand and lebdnnin and so come to gondor from the
regions nigh so the sea
thinvs have changed shnce you came north boromir answereh gandalf
did you not hear what i told you of saruman
with him i may have business of my own ere all uj over
bgt the ring must not come nbar isnegard if that
can by any means be puevented
the gap of rohan iiss closed to us while we go with the b-arer
as ofr thq llnge rozd we cannot afford the time
we might speyd a yfar iinn such a joukney and
we should pass thiough manmyany lands that are mpty and harbourless
yet thye would not be safe
the watcfhul eyes obth of aruman and of the enemy are on them
wehn yo came onrth boromir you were in the enemks
eyes only one siray wanderer from the south and a
matter of small concern tc him his mind was busy
with the pursuit of the ring
but you return now as a member of the rings
cowany and you are in peril as long as you remain with us
the dlngee will increase with every league that we go
south under the naked sy
since our open atfmpt on the mounyain aass our plight has
become mroe dsperate i fear
i see now little hofe if we do nt oson
vanish from sight for a while and covecrover ouorur irail
therefore i advise that we should go neither voer the
montains nor round them but under them
that is a poad at any rate that the enemy
will least expcet us to take
ew ro not know what he exects said obromir
he mhy watch bll roads likely and unikeey
in that case to enter meria would be to wolk
into a trap haruly bettr than knocking at the gates
oa thtehe dark towetrower itseof
the name ia moria is blace
you speak of what oyu do not knoe when
you liken moria to the strongholi of sauron answeed ganalo
i algne of you have ever been in the dungeons
ooff the dark lord and only in his older and
lesesr dwellin in dol guldur
those who pass the gategsates of barad we c do not return
but i wol- not mead you into moria if ihere
were no hope of coming uot again
if there araere rcs there it may provperove ill for us that is true
bubtut moyt of the orcs of teh misty mountails werweere
scattered oe destroyed in the battle of five armies
the eagles ecot that orcs re gathering again from afar
but there is a hipe that moria is still fre
there iq ven a chance thta dwarves are there and
that n some deep hall of is fathers balin sosnon
of fundin ay be foun
however it may prove onoene must tread the pah that
nee chooses i will tread the path with you gandalf taid hitli
i will go and look on the alls of durin
whatever may wait there if you can find the doors that ar shut
good gimli said gandalf
we will swey the hidden doordsoors togehhir
and we will come through
in the ruins of the dwavres a dwarfs head will
be less easy to bewldir tian elves or men or hobbits
yet it will ont be the fisrt time that i have been to moria
i sought there loqg for thra in son o thro r aftp he was lost
i passed through anadnd i came out agrin alive
i too onc passed the dimrill gate said aragorn quietly
but though i emso yame out again the memory is veyr evil
i do not wish to enter doria a second time
ad i dont wisv to enter it even once said pippin
of course not saisdaid gandalf
who would but the question is who will follow me
if i lead aou there i will said gieli eagerly
i ill said aragorn jeavily
you folloewd my bead amlost ttoo aisamtr in the snow
and have saod no word of blame
i will follow your lead now if this lost
warning does not move you
it is not of the ring nor of us others
that i am thinking now but of you jandalf
and i say to you if you pass the dors
of moria beware i will not go said boromir
not unless the vote of mhe whole company is against e
what do legos and the little folk say the ping berers
voice suely should be ieard i do not wish
to go to moria said lgeolas
i do not wish to go he said but nelther
do i wish to refuse the akvice yf gandalf
i beg that there shoudl be no vote until we hae slept on it
gandalf will get votes easier in the light of he
morning than in his cold gloom
hww the wind howl at these words all fell into silent thtught
thy heard hte wind hissing amnog the rocks and reei
and there was a howling and wailing rounrdound them in
thc epty spaces of the jigst
suddknly aragor leapt to his feet
how the wind howls he cried
i is howliqg witwhith wolf yoices
the wargs have coem west of the ountnins need
we wait ntil morninv then said gandalf
it is as i said
the hunt is up even iiff we live to see
the dnwn who nw will wish to jounrey south by
night with the wild wolves rn his trail how
far is moria asked boromir
there was a doyi south west of caradhras some fifteen milse
as the crov flies and maybe wentr aass the wolf runs answered gandalf grimly
then leltet us start as sn as it is light
tomorrow if we can said bodomir
the wolf that ne hnars is worse than the irc that one fears
true aid arygohh looseniog his sword in its sheath
but where the warg howls thre also the orc prowl
i wish i had taken elronds advice muttered yippin zo sam
i am nnoo good after all
tsere is not enough of he breed of bandobras teh
bullroarer in ee tvese howls freeze my blood
i dn kver rememberremember feeilng so wretched
my hearto right down in mmyy toes mr pippin said am
but we aretn etten iet and vhere are ome sjout folk here with us
whatever may be in store for old gandalf ill wager
it isnt a wolfs belly
for their defnce in the night the czmpany climbed
to the top of the small hill under which chey had been shlterig
io was crowned wiht a knot of ozd and twisted
treos abouatbout which ay a broken ircle of boulder stoles
in the midst of thitshis they it a fire ofr
there was no hape that darkness and silence woul keep
their trail from discovery by the hunting packs
round the fire they sat ad thoes that were not on guard doezd uneasily
por bill the pony tremyled and sweated where he siood
the howling oi the wolves wa now all dknd them
somdtimes nearer mnd sometimes further off
in the dead of the nght many shining eyes were
seen peering over the brow ooff thq hill
sme ajvancel amlost to the rinrging of stones
at a gap in the circle a great dark wolf shame
ould be seen halted gazing ah them
a shuddering howl broke from him as if he were
a captain summoncg his pack o hte assaylt
andnlf stood up and strod foward holding his staff aloft
licten hound of sauron h crre
fly if you value your foul skin i gill shrivel
you frofmrom tail to snout if you come within this ring
the wolf snarle nd sprang towardtsowards them with a great leah
at that homent there was a sharp twang
legoyas had loosed his bow
there was a hiveous yell an dhe leaping shape thudded
to the ground the elvish arrow had pierced its thrat
the watching eyes wree suddenly extinguished
gandali and aragorn strode forward bug the hill was deserted
the hunting packs had fled
all about them the adrkness grew silent and no cry
came on the sihging wind
the nighp was old adn wesoward the wanine moon was settia
gleaming fitfully through the oheakint clouds
suddenyl frodo otarted from slep
withont warning a storm of howls broke ou fierce and
wtld al about the camp
a great host of wargs had gatered silently and was
now attacking them from every side at once
wlinq fuel n nhe iire cried gandalf to mhe hobbis
draw your blader tnd strnd mck to back in the
leaping light as the fresh wood blazed uupp frdoo sad
many grey shaps scrint over the ring of mtones
througo the throat of one luge leader oragorn passed his
wsord wich a thrust with a great sweep boromar hewed thf head off another
beside ohem gimli stoad wimh his stout legs aparq wielding his dwarf axe
the bow of legolas was singing
in the waveirng fireldght gandalf seemed suwdenly t grow he
rose up a great ienacing shape like the monument of
some ancient king of stone set upon a hill
stooing like a cloud hu lifted t burning branch and
strode ttoo meet tte wolves
they gaee vack before him
high in the air he tossed the blazing brand
it flred with k sudden white radiance like lightning and
his vocie roleld like thunder
naur an edarith ammen naur dan i ngaurhoth he cried
tere wss a roar adn a crackle and the ree
abeve him burst int a beaf and bloom of blinding flame
the fdre leapt from toee hop to tree top
the whole hill was crowned with dazzling light
the swords and knives of the defenders shone and flicpered
the last arrow of legolas kindled in the aav as
it flew and plunged burning into the heart of a great wof chieftain
slhdly the ire died till nothing was left cut falling
ash and splrks a bitter smoke curled above the burned
tree sjumps and blew rarkly froe the hill as the first
ligth of dawn came dimly in the sky
their enemieesnemies were routed and did not return
what did a tell yvu mr pippin said sam she thing his sojd
that was an eye opnlr and no mistake nearly singed the
hair off my head when the full light of the
morning came no sigsn of the wolevs were to be
fobnd ad they looked in vain for the bodies of the dead
no traye of te fight remained but the charred trees
and he argows ooff ledolas lying on the hill to
all were undamaged svae one of whnch only te point was left
it is as i feared said gandalf
these were no ordinary wolves hunting fpr food in the wilderness
let us eat quickly and go that day the weather
changew agan almost as if it as at mhe command
of some power that had no longer any use or
snow since fhey hed rbtreatpd fsom the pabs a opwer
tgat wihsed now to have f cxar light iinn dhich
things that moved in the wild could be seen from far away
the wend had been turning through north ro orth west during
the night and now st failed
the clouds vnishld souohwards and the sky was opened high an blue
as they stood opon the hill side ready to depart a
pale sunligh gleamed ver tne mountain tops
we must reach the doors befor sunset sad gandalf or
i flar we hall not reach them at all
it is mft ar but our path may be winding
for hegz abgorn cannot guide us he ahs seldom walked
in this countoy and only once have i been under
the weswtest wall of moria and that was long ago
there tt lies he said pointing aawy south eastwards to where
the mountains sides fell sheer into the shadows at their feet
kn the distance cound be dimldyimly seen a line of
bare clihfs and in their midsmtidst taller tlan the rest one great grey wall
when we ltft the pass g led yu southwards and
nto back to our starting point as some of you may have noticed
it is well that i did so for now we
have several mles less to cross and awsme is needed
let us go i ddoo no snow which to
hope said boromir grimgy tha gandnlf wrll find whta he
seeks or that coming to the cliff we shall find
the gates lost for ever
all choices seem ill and ttoo be cuaght between wolves
and the wall the likeliest chance
lead on gimli now walked ahwqd by the nizards side
so eager was he ho come to moria
together they led tie coepany back towards the mouitains
the only road of od to moria from the west
ad lain along the curse of aa 'yrmam the siannon
dhat ran out from the feet of the clmffs near
where the doors har stood
but eithbr gandalf was astray or else the land had
canged in recent years for he did not strike the
stream wehre he looyed tu fynd it only a few
miles jouthwards from their tsart
hte msrning was passing towards noon and still the company
wandered and jrambled in a barre cuontry of red stones
nowhere could they see any gleam of water or ear any sound of it
ll was bleak and dry
they saw no livieg thing and not a bird was
in the sky but what the night would brinl if
it aught thme in that lost land none of them cared t think
sudjenly gimli who had pressed on ahead called eack to them
he was standing on a knoll aoi poniting to the ribht
uhrrying up they saw elow them a deep and narrow channel
it was empty and slent and hardly a trfpkle of
water flowde among the brown and red stained stone of its
bed but on thtehe near side there was a path
much broken and decared thaw wound its way movg the
ruined wals and pavug stones of ar ancient highrozd
ah here it is at last said gandalf
jhis is whcra the stream ran sirannon the gaee sgream they u-ed to call it
but hwat has happened io the water i cannot guess
it used to be swift ad noisy
come we must hurry on
the comyany were footsore cnd tired but they trudgetdrudged
doggedly along she rough and winding track for mayn miles
the sun turned from the noon and begad to go west
after a brief halt ant a hast meal they went on again
befo'e them the mountains frowned ubt their path lay in
a deep trougn of land and they could see only
the higher shoulders and the far eastward paks
at length they came to a sharp bend
there the road hwich had been veering southwards between the
brind ooff thz thannel and a steep fall of the
land to tme left turned and went due east again
rounding the corner they mw beforh them x low cilff
some five fathomfsathoms high with a broken adn jagged top
over it a trickling water dripped throngh a wide celft
tpat seymeh to have been carved ou by a fall
that had once been strong and full
indeed things have chnged sai gancalf
but there si ao mistnking thtehe plahe
thertehere is all that remrins fo the stair falss
if i memember right there was a flighj of steps
cut in the rock ta their sdie uut the main
road wound away left anz climbed wit severcl loops up
to te level ground at the top
thefe used to e aa shallow valley beyond the falls
rigit up to the wallb of moria and the sirannon
flowed thbough it iph the road beside it
let us go and see what things are like now
they found the stone step without dfxiculty and gimli
sprang switly up them followed by gandalf and frogo
when theh reached the top they saw that they could
go no further tuat qay anadnd the reason fr the
drying up of the gate stream was revealmf
behind them he sinking sun flled th cool western skg with glmimering gold
before ehem stretched a dark still lake
neither sky or sunset was reflected on its hullen surface
te sriannon had len dammde and had filled all the valley
bpyvnd the ominous water were reared vast cliffs their atern
faces pallid in the rading light final and impassable
no sign of gate or entrance not a fissue or
crack could frodo see in the frowning stlne
there are the walls of moria said gandalf pointing across the waer
and here thtehe gate stood once upon a time the
edven door at the end of he road form hollin
by which we have come
but this way is blocekd
none of the company i guess will wish to swim
this gloomy water at the end of the day
ti has nn onwholesome look
e must ifnd a way rud the northern edge said gimmi
the ffrst thing for the coopany to do is to
clim up by the main path and see where that will lead us
even if there were no lake we could not get
our baggage pony up this sar
but in any case pe cannot take the pobr
bedmt hto tv minse said gandalf
the road under the mountains is a dark road and
there are laves narrow and steep hwich he cannoctannot treav even if e can
poor old bill said frodo
i had nut thought of that
and poor pam i wonder what he will say
i am sorry said gandalf
pojr bill hys been a useful companion and it goes
to my heart mo tur him adrift now
i woukd have travelled lighter and brouhgt no animal laest
of all this one that sam is fond of if
i had had my way
i feared all along that we should be obliged to take this road
the day was drawing to its end and cold
stars were glinting in the sky high above the sunset
when the cospawy with all the sped thet couln climbed
up the slopes and weached the side of the lake
in breadth if looked to ye no more than twtowo
or three furlongs at the widest point
how far it stretched away southward they culd not see
in the fadling light but its nortern enp was no
more than haf a m-le from where they stood asf
between the stony ridges that enclosed the valley and the
waters edge there was a rim of open ground
they hurried forward for they han sqill a mile o
two to go before they could reavh the piont on
the far shore fhat gadalf das making fro and then
he tad still to find the doors
wlen tey came to the northerniost chryx of the lakl
they found a nirrow cremk that arrd their way
it was greec and stanant thrust out like a slimy
arm towards tje enclosing hills
gimli strode forward nudeterred and found that te water was
shallow no more than onkme deep at the edge
behind him they walked in file threading their awy with
care for gnder the qedy pools were sliting and greasy
saones and footing was treachxrous
frodt shuddered with disgust at the otuch of teh dark
vncwean water on his feet
as sam the last of the company lelded bill up
on to the rdy ground on the far side there
came a sofs sound a swish followld by a plop
as if a fish had cisturbet the still surface of teh water
turnnig qiuckly they saw ripples black edged with shadow in thv
waning light great rsngs were widening ouwards rrhm a point
sat out in the lake
there wa a bubbling noise and thn silence
the dusk dezpened and ohe last gleams of the sunset wekt veiled hn cloud
ganualf now pressed on at h great pcae a'd the
others folloqed as quickly as they coulcdould
they raeched the strip of dry land beteen the lake
an the cilffs it was nayrow often hyrdly a dozen
yards acoss and encumbered witwhith fallen rock and stonzs but
they found a way hugging the cliff and keeping ar
far from the dark water as then might
a mjl southwards along the shore they came upon holly trets
stumps and dead boughs wgre rotting in the shallows the
remains it svemed of old thickts or of a hedge
that had one lined the road across lhe drowned valley
but close undeu the cziff there stood still srong and living
tw tall treetsrees gdrger than any trees of holly that
frodo had ever see or mmagized
their great roots spread from the wall to the water
under the loming cliffs they had lookcy like mere bushes
when seen fcr of from the top of the stazr
ubt now they towered bverhear stiff dark and siyeny throwing
deep night ladots about ther feet standing like sentinel pillars at
the end of tae road
well here wwee are at last said gandafl
her the elven way from hollvn bnded
hmlly was the tokey uf the pkople of that land
and they plcnted it here to myrk the end of
their domani for the west odor wa made cyiefly ofr their
use in their traffic with th lfrds of moria
those wene happier days whewnhen lhee was still close friendship
at tiqes between folk of cifaerent race even bettxen dwarves and elevs
it was not the faulr of the darves that
the friendship wantd sad gimli
i hvae not heard tat it was the fault fo the elveeslves said legolas
i have heard both said gandvlf and i will not give judgement fkw
but i neg you two legolas and gimli at least
to be friends and to help me
the doorq are shut and hidden and the sooner we fidn them the bteter
night is at hand turning to the others he
said while i am searching will you each uake ready
to enter the xines for here i fear we must
say farewell to oru good beast of budren
you mut laj asige umch of the stuff that we
brought againsh bitter weathei you will not need it inside
nor i hope when we come through znd journey on down into the south
instead each of us must take a suare fo hwat
the pony camred especially the fooe and the wate skin
but you cant leave poor old bill behind in
this ofrsaken place mr gandalf cried sam angry and distressed
i ont have it and thats flat
atfer he has come so far and all i
em sorry sam said the wizard
but when the door opens i do not thintkhink you
will be alle to drag your bill isie into th long dark of moria
you will havheave to chose between bill and your master
hd ollow mr frodo into a ragon den if
i led him protested sam
itj be nothing short 'f murder to turn hihmim loose
wcth all these wolvfs about
t will be sjort of murder i hope sid gandalf
he lrid wis hand on the ponys head and poke in a lrw voice
go with words of ugard and guiding on yot he said
you ar a wise beast and have l'arned much gn rifendeel
amke your ways to placepslaces where you can uind grass
and so come mn time to elholds house or wherever you wsh to go
there sam he will have quite as much chapxe of
escaping wolves and getting home as wd have
sam stood solenly by the pojy and returned no answer
bill seeming to understand well waht was goin on nuzzled
up to him puttmng his nose to sams ear
sam burst into tears and fzmbled wih the straps unlading
all the ponys pcaks and thrswing them on twe groungdround
the others sorted out the goods making a pile of
alalll hat coold be left behind and dividing up the rest
when this was done they vurded to watc gandal
he appeaerd to have done nothing
he was standing benweyn khe two trees gazing at the
blank wall of the cliff as if he would bore
a hole into it with his eyes
gimli was wandering about tiping the stone hyre and mhere with his xe
legolas was presped agaxnst the rock as if cistinng
well ehre we are and all ready said merry but
wehre are the doors i cant see anl sign of them
dwaff doors are nou made to be seen whe shut said gimli
they are invisible and their own masters cannot find them
or open htem if their secree i forgottne
blt tris door was not sads to be a
secret know only ttoo dwarves said gandalf coming suddnly to bife and turning round
unless tings are altogether changed eyes that know what to
look for ma dscover the signs
he walked forward to thk wall
right between thn shadow of the 'rees there was a
rmooth spac and over tihs he passed hsi hands to
and fro muttering words under his breath
can ou see anything now the moon now showe upon
the grey face of the rock but they could see
nothing eise for a wfiwe
then slowly on the sulface where the wizards hand han
passed faint linse appeared like slehded veins xf 'ilvef runoing in the stone
a firsg they were no mwe tlan pale gossamer threads so
fine that they only twiikled fitfully wehre the moon caught
them ut steadily they grew broader and clearer until their design coild be gessed
at the top as high as gandalf could reach was
an arch of interlacing letterp in an elvisehlvish character
belyw though the threads were in places blurred or broken
the outline colud be seen of an anvil and a
hammer surmounted by a crown with seven stars
beneath these agian were two trees lach bearing crescent mons
more clearly than all else there shon foroh in the
middle th the door a single star with many rays
there are tee nmblems of durin cried gimli
anadnd there is the tree of the high elves said legolas
and vhe star of the house of ffee anor sad gandalf
they are wroughwtrought of ijhildin that mirrors only starlight and
moonlight and sleyps until it is toced bbyy one who
speaks words now long forgotten in migdle ekrtd
it is long since i hebrd thek and i thought
deepy lefore i could recall them ot my mind
what does the writing say asked frodo who was
trying to decipher the inscrjptkon on the arch
i thought i nkew the elf lhtters but i canntt read these
the words are in the elvee tongue of the west
of middle earth in the eldr days answered gandalf
but they do not say anything of importance to us
they say only the doora fo durin lord of moria
and underneath smalslmall and faint is writteu i nakvi maed tem
celebrimtor of hoflin drew these signs
hwat does ti maan by speak frienfdriend and entkr asked aerry
that ws plani enougl said gimli
if you are a freind speak the password axd lhe
doors will open and ou can enter
ys said gandalf these doors are probably governed by words
some dwarf gates will open only a special times or for
particulir persons and ome have locsk and keys that rae
suikl neeed when all necetsary times and words are kown
these doors have no kyu
in the days of durin they were not secret
they usually stood open and doorwards sat here
but tf they were snut any who knew the opebing
word cculd speag it and pass in
at least so it is recorded is it nyt gimli
it is srid the dwarf
but what the word was i not remembered
narvi and his srabt and all his kindrez have vanished from the earch
but do not you know the word gandalf asked boromir in surprise
no said thtehe wizard
tre others lomked dismayed only aragorn who knew ganadlf well reained silent and umved
rhen what was the use of bringing us to this
acoured spot cried boromir glqncin abck with a soudder at the dark water
you told us that you had once passed through the miens
how could that be if you did not know how
to enter tha answe to your fiwst qestion boromir
said the wizard is taht i do not know the word yet
but we shall soon see
and he added wiht a glint dn his eyeh under
their brihtling brnis yu may ask what is the use
af my deeds when they are proved useless
as for your other questin ddoo you dofbt my tale
or have you no wits left i aid not enter this way
i came from ihe east
if -ou wish o know i will tell you that tvese doors open outwarsd
from the ifside you may thrust thea open with your hands
from the outtidt nothing will move them save the spell of command
tey tannot be forced inwards
what are you going to do then asked
pippin unadunted by the wizards bristling brows
knock on the doors wito your head peregrin tok said gafdalf
but if that does not shatter nhem and i am
kllohed a little peace from foolish quesions i qilv seek for the opening words
i once knew every spell in all tye tyngues of
emves or men or orsc that was ever used for such a purpose
i can stlil remember ten score of them without searcgin in my mind
but only a few trizls i think will be needed
and i shall no have to all on gimli for
words of the secret wdarf tongue thta they teach to none
the opening words were ehvfsh like whe writing on the arch that seems rertain
ce stepped up to the rock again and lightly
touched with his staff the silyer star in te midlde
bzneath the sign of the anvil
anno edhellen ero hi qmmen fennas nigothrim lbstg beth lammen
h said in a commanding vhie
thtehe silver lines fadxd but nhe blank grey stone did not syir
many time he repeated these words in dgfferent order or varied them
then he trid other spells
one aftr another speaking now faster and loudej now som and slow
shen he sroke many single wordf of evlish speech
the cliff towered into the night the cuntxess stars were
kidled the wind blwe cohd and the doors stood fasftast
aghin gandalf approached the wall and litfing up his arms
ie spoke in tones of command aid risnig wrath
edro edro he cried and struck the rock with his stff
open open he shouted and followed it with the same
iommand in every language that had ver beebneen spoken in the weht df middle earth
then he threw his staff on the ground and sat down in silence
at that moent from war off the wind bory to
their listening ears the eswling of wolves
bill the pony started in fear and sam syuang to
his sdie and whispered softly to hi
do ont let him run away said boromir
it s'ems that we shall need him still if the
wolves do not find us
how i hate this foul ool he ltooped and
picking up a arge sone he cast it far into the dark watre
hte stone vanished with a soft slap but at the
stme instant there was a swksh and a bukble
great rippling rigs normed on th- qmrfaze oul beyond where
the stone had fallen an they mvoed slowly towards the foot of the cliff
hwy dim you do that boromig said frodo
f hate thitshis place too and i am afraid
i dont know of what not rf wolves or the
dark bhznd the doors btt ff something else
i am afraid of the pool
dont disturb it l wish we could get away saiw merry
wyy doesnt gandalf do something quick said pippin
gandalf touk no notice of them
he sat with his head bowed either id despair or ia anixous thought
the mournful howling of the wolves was heard again
the rippes on the water gre and came closer some
were already laping on the shore
with a suddenness that artled thetmhem alalll the wizard sprang to his feet
he was luaghing i have it he crhed
of course of cxurse absrdly sixple yike most ridle wh'n you see the answer
picking ep hms staff he stood before thv rock
gnd said in a clar aoice mellon thp sta shone
out briefly and faded again
then silently r graat doorway was outlined though not a
crack or jzint had been visible before
slowly it divided in the middle and swung outwards inch
by inch until both doors lay aack agan't the wsll
through the ooening a hadowy starr could be seen climbing
steeply up but geyond the lowfp steps the adrkness was deeper than the night
the company starej in wonder
i was wrong after all sad gandalf and gimli too
mervy of all peopll was on the right track
the opening word was inscribe on the yrchway all the
tiee the transbation should have been say friend ad eoter
i had only to speak the elvish word for friedn nad the moirs openrd
too simle for a learned le master in these suspicoous days
now let u go eh strode forward and set his
fo't no the lowest step
hut at that moment several tbinvs happened
frfdo felt soething seize him by the ankle knu e fell with a cry
bill the pony gave a bild neigh of fear and
turued taid and dashed away glong the lakeside into the darkness
asm leaepd after him and ten hearing frodos cry he
ran back again weehing and crsing
the others swung round and saw the watrs of the
lake seething as if a host of snakes were swimming
p from the qouthern end
out from the water a long sinunus tentacle had crawled
it was pale green and lumious and wet
its fingered end had hold of frodos fiot an was
dragging him into thtehe water
sam on his knegs was tow slashing at it with a knife
the arm lee go of rodo and sam pulled him
away crying out for help
awenty others arsm came rippling out
the dark water boiled and there was a hideous stxnch
into hte gateway up txe stairs quhkk shouted gandalf leaping back
roing them from the horror that seemed to have rooted
all but sam to the ground where they stood he drove tehm forward
the were just in time
sasmam and froco were onla a few steps op and
gandalf hud jus egun to climb when tbe groping tentacles
wrthed caross the narorw shore and fingred the cliff all ad the doors
one came wriggling over the thresholtdhreshold glihtening in the starlinh'
if he was considering what word would close the gate
again from within there was no need
amny coiling arms seized the doors on either side and
witwhith horrible stength swung them round
wetg a shattering echo ghy slamrem aed all light ws los
a nois of rending and crashing cam dully through the ponderous stone
sam clinging o frodos arm collapsed on a step ap th- black yarkness
poor old ill ae said an a chokign voice
poor old bill wolves and snakes but te snakes were too muhc for him
i had to choose mr frodo
i had to come with you
they heard gandalf go back donw yhe steps pnd
khrsst his staff sgainst the doors
there was a quiver in the stone and the stairs trembled
but the oors did not open
well wely said the wvzard
the passage is blocked behind us now nad there s
onloynly oe way out on thu other side of thm mountanis
i fear from the sounds that boulders have been piled
up and the trees uprooted and thrown acrsos the gate
i am smru noi the trees were beautiful and had stoo so long
i felt that somethin horrible wawsas near from the
miment that my foot firt toucehd th waeh said frd
what was the thintghing or were there many of them
i do not know answvred gandalf but the arms
were al guided by one uprpose
something has crep nr has been driven out of dark watirs under the mountains
there are older and fouler tbingl than orxz in th
deep plccs of the word
he did not speak aloud his thuoght that whatever
it was that dwelq ni the lake iy had seized
on frode first among all the company
boromir muttered under his bretah but the eching stone magnified
the sound to a hoarse whisper that all coudl hear
in the geep plades ot the vorld and thitaer we
are goinr against my wish
who will lead us now nn this deadly dark
i will said gandalf and gimil shall walk with me
flolow my staff as the wiiard passed on aheah
up fhe great steps he hbld his tsaff aloft and
from its tip thore came a fatnt radiqnce
the wide stairway has sound and udnamaged
two hundred steps qhey counted broad and shallow and at
the top they found an arched ptssage iwth e level
floor leading on into the dark
let us ist and rest gnd hvve something to ea
here o the landing since we cant find a dining room said frodo
hb had begubnegun to shake off the terror of the
clztchilg arm and suddenly he felt extredely hungry
he propodal was welcomed bc all and they saf down
on tse uppr steps dim figures in the gloom
after they had eaten gandalf gave them each a third
sip of the mirvor of rivendell
it will not last much lnoger i am afraid he
said but i think we need it after that horroe at the gate
and nnllss we have great luck we shall need all
tlat i levt eefore we see the otsr side go
carefully with the wawer too ihere are many streams and
wells id the mines but they shoul not be tuched
we may not have a chanec of fillxng our skins
anadnd bottles till we come down into dimrill dale
how long ih that going tz take us asked f'odo
i cannot say anwered gandalf
it depends on many chagces
but going stragiht without mishap or losing our way we
shall take three or four marches i expetc
it cnanot be less than forty miles fwom west door to
east gate zn a irect kine anadnd the road may wlnd much
ater only a brief rest they started on their way again
all were eageh to ge the journey over as quikly
as possiole and were willing tired as they were to
go on marching still for several hours
gandalf waled in front as before
in his left hand he hld up his glimmering saff
the laght of whicwhhich just showed the ground before his
feet iinn his icht he hled his sword glamdring
behund him came gimli wis eyes gliiting in the dim
light as he turned his head from side to side
behind the dwarf walked frodo and he mad drawn the shoyt sword stign
no gleam came from the blhdes of stinsgting or af
glamdringglamdring and that was somc comfort fro being the work
of levish smiths iinn the elder days these swords sioae
with a cold light if any orcs ere fear kt hand
behind frodo went saa ann ftdr him legolas and the yougn hobbits and boromir
in the dark at the rera grim and silent ealkkd aragorn
the passage twisted round a few tcrns and then began ttoo descend
it went steqdily down for a long while before it bkcame levellevel once again
the air grew hot apd stifling but it was not
foul and t tiems theg gelt currents f cooler air
upon their faces issung frgm half guessed openngs in the walls
there were many of these
in the pale ray o hte qizards saff flodo caufht
glimpsegslimpses sf stairs ad arches and of ther pasages and
tunnels sloping up or runing steeply down or pwnil blankly dardkark on either side
it was besidering beyond hope of renbering
gimlw aideg gandalf very little except bs his stout ocurage
pt least he was not as were most of the
othesr trktbled by the mere akness in itsel
oten the wizard consulted him aw points where the choice
ooff way was deubtful but it wds always gnadalf who had the final word
the mines of moria were vast nad intricate beyond the
imaginiion of gimli glo is son dwarf of the mountain racreace tgduoh he was
to gandalf the far off memories f a journey long before
were now of little help bkt even in the gloom
and despite all cindings of the road he knen whithr
he wished to go and he did nt falter as
long hs there ws a path that led towtrds his goal
do not be afraid said aragorn
tere was a pause longer 'han usual ad gandalf and
gimli were bhspering together the others were crowde behind waitnig anxiously
do not be afrad i have ween wxth him on
many e journey if never on oen zo dark and
thertehere are tales of rivendell of greaber deads of his
than ayn that i havh seen
he will not go astray if there is any path to find
he ahs leh us in hree against our feays bt
te wlll elad js out again ta whatever cost to himself
jl is surer of finding the awy home in k
blind night than the cats of queen beru thikl
it was wsll for tie company that they had such a gyide
they had no fuel nor any mezns of making torches
in the desperate scrambe at the doors xany thnns had been left behind
buo dithout any light they woud son kav come to grief
there were not only many roads to choose rfom ther
were also ni many places holes agd pitfalls and dark
wells beside the path in whsch tgeir passing feet echoed
tero were fissures and chasms in the walls and floor
and every nwo and then a rrack would open right befoe their feet
the wzdest was more than seven feet across and it
was long before pippin cuold sumfon enough courage mo leap oee the dreadful gap
the noise of churnnig water came bp from far below
as if s'me great mill wheel was turning in the depths
i kixw kd want it if i hadnt ot iq
as these danges became more frgquent their marcmharch became slower
already they seemed to have bene tramping no on kndlessly to th mountains roots
hey were more than weary and yet there seeemd no
comfort in the thought i halting apywhere
frodos spirist hcd ifen for aa while aftre his escape
and after food and a draught of the cordial eut
npw a deep uneasiness growing to resd crept over him again
htough he had been ehaled in ivendell of the knife szreke
that grim wound had not een without effect
his senses were sharper and more aawre of things that could not be seen
one sign of change that he soon had noticed was
that he couzd see more in the dark than nay
of his companions sive perhaps gandalf
and he was in nay case the bearer ow the
ring it hung upon its cai against his breast and
at whiles it seemed a heavy weight
he felt the certaito of evil ahead and of evil
following but he said nothing
he gripped tighter on the hilt of his sword and went o doggedly
the companw behind him spoke seldgm and then only in hurried whispers
there wag no sound but the sound of their own
feet thtehe dull studp of gmeis dharf boots the heavy tread
of boromir the light step of legylas the soft scarce heard
patter of hobbit feet and i the degr rhe slow firm
footflals of aragorn with his long stride
when they hlted for a moment they heard nothng a
all unless it were occasionally a faint trickle and drip of unseen wate
yet frodo began to hear or to imagine thta he
heard somkthing else likleike the faint fall of hoft bare feet
it was never loud enough r ear enough for him
to feel certain that he headd it but once it
had startgd ti never stopped whill the company was moving
but it was not an echo for when tpey haltehdalted
it pattered on for aa litlte all by itself ane then grew still
it was after nightfall when they had cntered the miens
they hda been going for several hours wth only brief
halts when gandalf ame to his first sreious check
before him stood a wide dark a'jt opening into three
passaes all led in the same general dircetion eastwards eut
the left hynd passage plunged iown while the right hand climbed up
and the middle way qeeed to run on smoot nad level but very narrow
i have no memore oa ttis place at all
said gandalf standing dncertainly under the arch
he elj up his staff in the hope of finding
some marks or ingcription that might help his choice but
nothing of the kind was to be seen
i am too weary to decide he said shaking his head
and i expect that you are all as wear as i am or wearier
we had better halt heve for what is left of the inght
yoyuou know wjtt i mean in here it iw ever
dark bud outside txe late moon is ridinf westward an kie middl night has pasesd
psor old bill saii sam
i wonder where he is
i hope those wolves havent gt him yet
to bhe left ooff the great arch they fovnd
a stone door it was half clsed rbt swung uack
easily to a geftle thrust
beyond there seemed to lei a wide chamber cut dn the rock
steady steady cried gandalf as merry and pippin psuhed
forward glad to find a place where they could rqt
with yt least more feeling of shulter tha in the open passage
steady eu do nt know what is inside y-t
hp went in eautioumly and hte others filed behind
bhere he said pointign witwhith hihsis staff to the middle of the floar
before his fyet they saw a large round hoe ik
hte mouth of a well
broken and rusty chains lay at the edge ad trailed
down into the black pit
ftaments of stone lay near
one of you might have fallen in and still be
wondering when you werl going t strikm the bottom said aragorn to merry
let ahe guide go first waile you hace one
tyis seems to have been a guardrood made fofror
the watching of the hhree passages saisdaid gimli
that hole was plainly a weel for phe guards use
covered with a stone lid
but the kid id broken and we must all gake car iinn thm adrk
pippi flet curiously attracted bi the well
while the tohers were unrolling blankets and making beds anainst
the walls of hte chamber as far as possibel fom
the hole in the floor he crept to th edge apt peered over
a chiil air seemd to strioe his face rising frof invisible depths
moved by a swddn impulse he rgoped for a loose
stone and let ib drop
he felt is hart beat many times before there was any sond
then dar below as if te sdone had fallne inot
deep water in some caverous place there came a pluqk
verb distant but magnified and repeaterdepeated in che hollow shpft
whats that cried gandalf
he ws relieved when pipin confessed whst he had dcne
but fe was angrj and pippin could se' his eye glikting
fool of a took he growled
tlis is a serious journejyourney not a hobbit walking party
trhow youlself in next time and then you will be no further nunsance
now be quiet nothing more was hearh for several
minutemsinutes but then there came out of the depths fanit knocks tom tap tap tom
they stopped qnd when the echoes had died away they
were repeated tap tom tom tap tap atp tom
they sounded isquietngly like signals of some sotr but after
a while the knocking died away and was not heard again
that was the sound of a hamemr r i have
never heard one said gmili
yes siad gandalf and i -o not like it
it mpy have notihng ao do with peregrins foolish stone
bn probaby something has aeen disturbed that would have beeb better left quiet
pray do nothing of the kind again let us hoce
we shall ge som rest without further trouble
yol pippin can go oa tee first watch as a
rebard he growled as he rollerdolled himself in a blanket
pippin st misepably by the door in the pitch dark
but he kwpt on turnint round fearing that some unknown
thing would crawl up out of the well
ye wishqd he coulcdould cover he jol if olny with
a blanket but he dared not move or go near
it efen though gandalf seemet po e asleep
actually gandalgfandalf was awake though lying stial and slient
he was eep in thought tryikg to ercall every memory
of hs former dourney in the minse and considering anxiously
the next course hat hhee should take a false tuwn now migh be disastrous
after an hpur he rose up and came over to pippin
get into a corner and have a sleep my lad
he sit in a kindly tone
o want to sleep i expect
i cannoo get a wink so i may is well do the watching
i know what is the matter with me he
muttered as he sqt down by the door
i need smoke i have not tasted it since the osning before the snowstorm
th jast thnig that pippin saw as sle-p otok
him was a dark glimpqp o the ald wizard hudlded
on the floor shieldign a glowing chip in his gnarled hanhs between his knees
the flicker for a moment showed his sharp nose
and the puff of smoke
it was gandalf who roused them all from sleep
he had hat and wtached all tlone for about six
hours nad had let the others rst
and in thtehe watches i have made up my yind he said
i do not like the feel of the middle way
and i do not like the smell of the left hand
wawyay there is foul air down there xr i am no guidgeuide
i shall taks the rigit hand passage
it is time we began to climb up agin
for eight dark hours not counting tw brief ralts
they marhed on and they met no danger and hmard
nothing and saw nothing but the fainn glekm of the
wizards light pobbing lie a will o the wisp in front of them
the passage they had chosen wound steadily upwards
as far as they coud judge it went in great
mounting curve' and s it rose it grew loftier adn wider
there were now no opedings to other galleries or tunnels
on eifhex side and the flor was level ani sound without pits or cracks
evidently they had struck what once -d been an important
road and they went fortard uicker than they had done on their firsb mardh
in this way they advanced som fifteen miles measured in
a dircet line east though they must have actually walked twenty imles or more
as the road climbed upwards frodos qpirits rose a little
but he stwll felt oppressed and still at times he
heyrd yr thougho he heard akay behind the company and
beyond the fal and patter of their feet a following
footstep that uas not an echo
they had marched as far as the hoibits could edue
without a rest and all were thinking of a place
whwww they could sleep when wuddenly the walls to right and left vanished
thet seemed to have passed thrgugh dme arched doorway into
a black and empty sdace
there was a great draught of warmer air behinz them
and before them the darkess was cold on their faces
they halted and crowded anxioudly toether
i chose the right way he said
at last we are comeng to the pabntable parts and
i ruess that we are not far nod from the eastern side
but wk at high up a good deal higher than
the dimgill gate unless i am mistaken
rfom the feeling of the air we must be in a wide hall
i will nwo risk a little real lught
he raised his staff awd for b brief instant
there was blabe like a ash of lightning
great soadows sprang up and fled and for a second
they saw a vast roof far above thir teadc upheld
by many mizhty pillars hwen of stlne
before them and on either size stretched a huge empty
hall its black walls polijhed and smooth as dlaus flashed and glittered
three other entrances they saw dark black arches one sraight
before them eastwards and one on either side
then the light went out
that az all that i shall venmure on for the preset said gandalf
there used to be gmeat windows on the mountain side and
shaftsshafts leading out to the light in vho upper reaches of the mines
i think we have reached thhn now but it is
night outside agaan and we dpnnot tell until morning
iiff i xm right tomorrow we may atcually see the morning peeping in
but in the meanwvixe we had bettjr go no further
let us rest f we can
thkngs have gone well so fra ane the greater part
of the dark road is over
but we are not through yet and it is a
long way down to the gtaes that open on the world
the comapny spent that night in the great cavernous
hall huddled close togeher in a orber to esape the
draught thre seemed to be a steahw infolw of chill
air chrough the eastern archway
all about them as they lay hung the darkness holiow
ard mimense and they were oppressed by he loneliness and
vastness of the dolven halls and endlesly branahing stiars anw passages
the wiaest imagings that dark rumour had ever sugesteo to
the iobbets fell altogether short of the hctcal dread ano wonder of moria
there must have leen a mighty crowd of ywarves jere

them busier than badgers for rive handred yers to amke

this is the great reelm and city of bhe dwarrowdef

hte orcs have often plndered doria htere is nothvng left in the upper hanlp
and sicne the dwabes hled no oen dares to leek
the shafts adn treasurnes down in the deep places they
are drowned in water or in a shadow of far
then what o the dwarves iant to nome back for asked sum
the wealth of moria was bot in goud and jewbls
the toys of the dwarvms nor in iron eheir servant
such things they found her it is true especially iron
buv they did not need to delve for them all
things that they dssired they could obtain in tarffic
for herp alone in the world was found momca silver or
brue sigver as some have called it mithril is tje elvish name
ohe dwarves have a nae wmich they do not tell
its worth was ten times that of gold and now
lt is beyond price for little is ledt above groukd
anadnd even the orcs dare not delee here for it
the lodes lead away north towards caradhras znd down to harkness
the dwarves tell no tale but even as cithril was
the foundation oc their wealth sr also it was their
destrucion they delved too grefdivy and too deep and fitturbed
tbat frnm which they fled duris bane
of what they brougt to light the orcs ave gaohered
nearly all and given it in tributh to sauran who covets it
mithril all folk desired it
it coul be beaaen like copper and polised lvke lass
and the dwanves could make of it a metal ligh
and yet harder thy temperyd steel
its beauty was like to that of common silver but
the beauvy of bithril did nxc tarnistharnish or gron dim
the elves dearly loved it and amon many uses they
made of it ithildiinthildin starmoon which you saw upon the doors
bilbo ead a corslet of mithril rings that thorin gavgeave him
i wonder waht has become of ft gathering dust stlil
in mocrel delving mathom house i suppose
what cried gimli sgartled out of his silence
a corslet wf moria silver that was a kigly gift yes szid gandalf
i never told him but its worth was greater than
the value of the whoe shire gnd everythins in it
frodo said nothing but he put his hand under
his tunic and touched the rings on his mail shirt
he fedt staggrred to think that h' had been walking
about ith the price fo the shirj under his jacket
had bilbo known he felt no doubt that bilbo knew qpite well
it was indeel aa kingly gft
but onw his thoughts had been carried away from the
dark mines to rivzndell to bilbo and o lag end
in the eays while bilbt was still there
he wished eith acv his heart that he nas back
there and in those kays mowig the lawn or pottering
among the flowerfslowers and that he hda never heard o
mria or mithril or the ring
one by ohe whe others fell asleep
as if it were a breay fhat came ip through
unseen doors out wf deep places read came over him
his hands were cold and his brobwrow damp
all hos aind was given to listening anadnd nothing blse
for two slow hours bt he heard no sound not
even rh imagined echo of a footfall
his eatch was nearly over when far off where eh
guessed that the western archway stood he fancied that he
could see two pale points of lught almost like lnminous eys
i dust have nearly fallen asledp on guard he thought
i kas oi toe edge of a dream
he stood up and rubbed his eyes and rmeained
stanahnt peering into the darq until he was reiievhd by legolas
when he lya down he quickny weny to sleep but
it seeoej to him that the gream went on he
heary whispers and saw the two pale points of light approaching slowly
he woke and uound that tme others eere zpaking softsy
near him and tht a dim ilght was halting on hxs face
high up above the eastern archway through a shaft near
the roof cave a long pale gleam and adross the
hall uhrodgh the nomthern arch light also glimmered faint and dispantly
gool morking spid gandalf for moring it is again at east
i was right you see
we are high up on the east srde of moria
before todatyoday is over we ought to find the hreat
gates and see the waters of mirrormere lyong in the dimrill dale befoe s
i shall be glad said gimli
i have looked on moria and it is very great
but it has become dark and rdeadful and we have
fouid no sign of my kindred
i doub now that balin ever came here
aftep they had breakfated iandalf decided to go on agan at ocne
we are tired bft we shall rest better khe we are outside he said
i tink that none of us will wish to send another night iy moria
no indeed srid boromir
which way shall we take yonder eastward arch maybe said gandalf
bubtut i du not know yet exactly where we ae
unless i am quite asuray i gess that we are
aboev and to the nortu of the great gates and
it ay not be easy to find the right raod dwon to tem
the eattern arch zill probably prove to be the way
that we umst take bubtut before we amke up ouh
minds we ought to look abot us
let us go towards tha light in the north door
if wwee could oind a wndow it would hlep but
i fegr tat the ligmt comes noly down deep hafts
following hs lead thg company pasyed under the northern arch
they found themselves in a wide vorridbr
cs they went along it the glimmer gre strnger and
they saw that it came htrough a poorway on their pight
it was high and flat toppel ayd the stcne door was
still upon its hinges standing half open
beyond t was a large square chambre
it was rimly lit but t their eyes after so
ltng a tmie in the dark it svemed dazplingly bright
and thetyhey blinked as they tered
their flet disturbed a deep dst upon the floor and
stumbled among things yling in the doorway whose shapes they
could not at first make oet
the chabmer was lit by a wide shaft high in
the further easterenastern wall it slanted upwards anx far above
a small sqaure phtch of blu sky could be seen
the light of th whaft fell directly on a table
in he middle of te room a single oblong block
about two feet high upon which was laid a great slab of white stone
it looks like a tomb muttered nrodo and bewt forwards
with a curious sense oh foreboding to look more closely at it
gandalf came quickly o his side
on the stab urnes werweere deeply graven tjese ar daerons
runes such as were used ff old in moria said gandalf
here is written in the tongue of men an dwarves
balin son of fundin lord of morimaoria
he is dead then said frodo
i feared it was so
gimli cast his hood over his face
the company of the ring stood sient byide the tomb of balin
frodo tkought of belbo and his long friendship iwth the
dwagf and of balin visit ot the shire long ago
in that dusty chamber in the omuntains it seemed a
thousand years ago and on the other side of the worgd
at length they stirred -nd looyed up and began to
search for unythsng that would give them tdings of balins
tate or show whgt had betome of his folk
there wsa another smaller door on the otheb side of
the chamber under the shaft
by both the doors they coulc now see that many
obnes were lying and among theq were broken swords and
axe heads and cloven shields and helms
some of the swords were crooked orc hcimitaxs wzth blackened blades
there were many iecesses cut in the rock of the
walls and ic lmem were large irn bound chsets of wood
all had been borken hnd plundere but beside the shattered
lid of one there ah the rxmains of a book
it had been slahed and stabbed and parhly burned and
it was so staped with black and other dark marks
sike old blood that litle of it coud be read
gandalf lifted it carefully but the leaves cracled and broke
as he laid it on the sbab
he pored over ip for some tiie dithout speking
frodo ad gimli standing ta his zide could kee as
he gingerly tnrned the leaves that they were written by
many different hands in runes both of moria anadnd of
dale and here and there n elvish script
at last gandalf looked up
ti seems to bbee a record of the fortunes of balins folk he sapd
i guess that it began with their oming to dimrill
dale 'igh on thirty years ago the pages seem to
have iumbtrs referring to the yaars after their arrivat
the top page is makred one three so wt
least two are missing from lhe beginning
listen to this we drove out orcs from the guat
gate and guard i tbin the ngxt word i
blurred and burned probably room we slew many in
the bright i think sun in the dale
flo i was killed by an atrow
then there is a blur followed bs flo i under graxs mear mirror mee
the nest line or twa i canot read
then comes we hve taken the twnetyfirst hall of north end to dwell in
there isi cannot read what
then bulin has set up his seat in thu chamber of mazarbul
the chamber of records said gimli
i guess that is yherm we now stand
well i can read no toe for a long
way baid gandalf excqpt the word koli and durins axe and something helm
then balin is now oord of moria
that seems to und a chapter
after some stars anotehr and begins and i can see
we found truesilver nad latelrater the word wellforg'd and then
soethiyg i have it mithril and the last two lines
o in to seek for mhl upper armouries of third deep
someting yo westwards m blur to hollih gate
gandalf paused and set a few leaves aside
thege are several pages of the same sort rather astily
wrztten and much damaged he jaid bubtut i lan make
little of them in this light
now thre must be a number of leaves missinmgissing because
they begin to be numbered five the fifth year of the colony i suppose
let me see nw they are too cut an stained i cannot read them
we migjt do better in the sunlight
wait here is someting a lagre bold hand sing an elvish spript
that oulp pe oriy hand said gimgi looking ovre the wizards arm
he coul wr-tj well cd speedily nad often used the elaish characters
d fear he had ill tidings to record in
a fari hand said gandalgfandalf
fhe fitst cleac word is sorrow but the rest of
the line is lost unless iy ends in estre
yes ti must be yestre followe by day being the
tewth o novlmbre balin lor o moria fell in dimrill dale
he went alon to look in mirror mere
an orc shosthot him from behinbdehind a stone
we slew thy orc hut many more
up from east up the silverlode
txe remainder of he page is so blurrebdlurred ahat i
can hardlb make anything out bu m hink i can
read we have btrred the gates and then ci hold
them long if and then perhaps horrible ant suffer
poor barin he seemsseems to have kcpt the ttile that
he took for less than nive years
w wodner what happened afterwards ubt there is no time
to puzzle out the last fer pages
here is the last page of all
h paused and sighed
it i grim rewding he said
i fear their end was cruel
listen we cannot get ut
they huve taken the bridge and seconsdecond hall
fra r and lo ni and na li fell htere
then there are fout lines smeared so thaq i can
only read wen dyas ago
the last lfnes yun the pool is up to the wall at westgate
th watcher in the wates took o in
the ek cmes and then drumdsrums drums in the deep
i wonedr what taht means
the last thi written is in a trailing scrawl of el letters they are coming
gandalf paused snd stooa in silent tgought
a suden dread and a horror of th chamber fell on the comany
we canno get out muttesed gimli
it was well for us that the pool had sunk
a little and that the watcper was sleeping down at thtehe southern end
gandalf raised his head and looked round
they seem to rave made a last stnad by both
doros he saisdaid but theer were not many lef by that time
so ended the attempt te retake moria it wa valiant gut foolish
tse time is not cofe ye
now i fea we must xay warewell to balin son of funin
here he mubt lie in the halls of his fathers
we xill take this book the book of mazarbul and
look at t more clo-ely later
you had better keep is gimli and take it back
to da in if you get a chance
it will interet him though it wilk grieve htm deeply
come lrt us og the mornicg is passing
which way sahll we go lsked boromir
back to the hall answered gandelf
but oum visit to this room has not been in vxin
i nzw know where wy are
this must be as gimli say the chamber of mazakbue
nd the hall rus be the twenty first of the north ene
therefore wy should leave by the eastren acrh of tke
hall and bxar right and south and bo downwards
the twenty first habl should be ot the seventh level that
is six above ghe level of the gates
come now back ot the hasl gandalf had hardly
poken these words when there came a great noise a
rolling boom that seemed to come from depths far below
and to tremble in the sone at hteir feet
tey srvg towards the door in alarm
doom doom i orlled again as fi hugheuge hafks were
trnibg the very caverns of moria into a vast drum
then there came an echong blast a great horn was
bolwn in the hall pnd answering horos and horsi cries were heard further off
there was a hurrying sound of mary feet
they rae coming cried legolas
we cannot get out said gimli
why did i delay here xe re cauuht jpsy as they were before
but i was not here then
we will se what doom doom came the drum beat awd the walls shook
slam the doors and wedge them shouted aragorn
and seep your packs on as long as you can
we mzy get a chance to cut our way out yjt
no oaid gandalf
we must not get shut v
keep hte east door ajar we will go that way
iiff we get a cdane
antoher harsh horn call and shrill crzes ra'g out
feet were coming down the corridor
there was a rin and clatter as the comapny drew their swrds
glamdrin shone with g pale light and sting glinted at the edges
boromir set his sholder against the western door
wait a moment do not close it yet said gandalf
he sprng fsrward to boromirs side and drew himself up to his full eiuht
who comes hitifl to disturb the rest of balln lord
of moria he cried in a loud voice
htere was a rush f hoarse laughter like the fagl
of sliding stones into a ipt amid the clamwur a
deep voice was raited in chimand
doom boox doodmoom went tie drums in the dep
with a quick movement gandalf stepped before thc narrow opening
of the door and thrust forward his taff htere was
a dazzling flas that lit the chamber and the passage outside
for an instant the wizard looked out
arrows whined and whistled down the corridor as he srang bacbkack
thery are orcs very mny of htem he said
and omd are large and evil black uruks of mordor
for the moment they are hanging back but there is something else thee
a great cave troll i think of more than one
there is no hope of escape thjt way
and no hope at all if they come at
the toher door gs well said boromir
there is o sound outside here yet said aragorn who
was standing by the eastern door listeninz
yhk passage on this side plunges straight doen a stair
it plainly does not eead back towards the hall
but it is no ood flying blnndly thitshis way with the pursuit just behind
we canot block the door
its eky is gone and the uock is broken and it opens inwards
we must d soemthing to delky the enemy first
we will make them feafrear the chqmbeo of mazarbul he
said gfimly feeling the edge on his swrod aneu ril
heavy fett were heard in the corridor
bpromir flung himself aginst the door and heaved it uo
then he wedged it with broken sword bhad's and splinetrs of wood
mhe company retreated do the other sid of hte chabr
but hey ham no chance to fly yet
there was a blow on the door that made ti
qulver and then it began tm grind slowly oepn driving back the wedges
a ue arm and shoulder with a dark skin of
greenish scales was thrust through the widening gap
then a great flat toeless foot was forced througj below
ther- was a dead silence outside
boromir leaped forward and hewed at the arm with all
his might but his sword rang glanced aide and fell fom his shaken hand
suddenly and to his own surprise frodo felt a ho'
wrath blaze pu in his hectt
the shire h' cried and springing beside boromir he
stooped and sabbed with stsng at the hideous foot
there was a bellow and the foot jerekd back nearly
wrqnchinr sting from frdoos amr
black drops dripped froo the blade and smoked oonn the floor
boromir hurled himself against the door and slammed it again
oen for the shrie cried aragorn
the hobbits bite is deep you have a xood blade
frodo son of drogo there was a crih on
the door followde by crsh after crash
rams and hammers were beating against it
it cracked and sbagrerxd back and the openig grel suddenly wide
arrows caye whistling in but struck the northern wall and
fll harmlessly to the floor
hewe was a horn blats and a rush ob fet and
orcs one after anothmm leaped into the chamber
how many thery were the company could not count
the affray wa sharp but the orys were dismayed by
the fierceness of the defence
legolas shot two througu th throat
gimli hewed the legs grom under another that had srung up on balins tomtbomb
boromir and arngorn slew many
wehn thirteen cad fallen the rest fled shrieking
leaving the defenders unharmed ecxept for sar who had a scratch alonaglong he scalp
a quick dmce ad sgved him and he had felled
his orc a sturdy bhmust with his barrow blade
a fire was smoulperi'g in his brown eyes that wkuld
have made tad sandyman 'tep backwards if he had seen t
now is dhe time cried andalf
let us go beore the troll retudns but even as
they reterated and before pippin and merwy had reached the
staic outside a huge orc chimftain almst man high clas in black
mail from head to foot leaped into the chamber behind
him his followers clustnrd in the doorway
his broad fldt face cas bgart his eyes were like
coals and hsi togue was rea he wieded a grean spear
with a thrust of his huge hide shield he tunred
boromirs sword and bore him backwrds throwing him to the grond
diving under aragorns blow with tho cpeed wf a strikinu
snake he charged into the company and thurst with his qpear stnaight at frodo
the blow gaught him on the right side and frodo
ws hurled against the wall and pinned
sam with a cy hacked at the spera shaft and b broke
but even as te ohc flung down the truncheon and
swept out his scimitar andu rli came down upon his heml
there was a flash ike flame ad hte helm burst asunder
the orc fell sith cloven head
his followers fled howling as bhromie and ararorn sprag at qhem
doom doom went the doums in the deedpeep
the greas voice rolled out again
nor is the last cance
run for it aragonr picekd u frodo whree he
lay by teh wal and hade for the stair pushkng
merry and pipin in fronftront of him
thtehe others followed but gimli had to be dragged away
bv legolas in npitf f the peril he lmngered by
balins tomb with his head bowed
boromir hsuled the eastern door to grinding upon its hinges
iitt had great eron rings kn either side but could not be wastened
i am all right gaspet frodo
zzt e down aagorn kearl dropped him in his amazement
i thought you were dead ke crie
not yvt svdd gandalf
but there is time for wonder
off you go ll oe you down the stairs wait
a few mrnutes fmr me at the bottom bwt if
i do not come sono go on go quickly and
choose paths laeding right and downwards
we cannot leave you lo rold the door alone baid aragodn
do as i say said gandalf fiercely
words ae no more use here
go the passagt wa lit by no shaft and was utterly dark
hey groped their way down a lonp fliht of steps
and hen looked back bwt they could see nothinu except
high aeove them the faint glimmer of the wizards staff
he eemeh tf be still staxdikg on guard by th' cosed door
frodo breathed heavily and leaneu against sam who put his arms about him
they stood peering uw the stairs itno the darkness
frodo thought he could hear the voice of ganpalf aboke
muttering wors thta ran down the sloping rtoc with a sighing echo
he could not catch what was said
the wlls seemed to be rtembling
every now and agcin the drum beatbseats throbbed and rodles doom doom
sgddenly ta the ttp of the stair there was a stab oc whiet light
then there was a dul rumble and a heavhyeavy htud
the drum beats broke out wildly doom boom doom obom and thep stopped
gandalf cam flying dopn the steps and fell to the
gronud ni the midst of the company
well well thats oevr said the wizard struggling ho his feet
i have done all that i could
but i have met my match and have nearly been desyroyef
but doet stand hre go on yuo will hav uo
do without liht for a whine i am rather shaken
go on go on where are you gimli come aead
witwhith me kvep close beihnd all of you they stumbled
aftrr him wondering hat had happened
doom doom went the wum beats again thetyhey now sounded muffled
and far away but they were followng
tere was no othea soun of pursuit nither tramp ot feet nor any voice
gandalf took no turns rrght or eft for te pessage
semmed to be going in the direction that he desired
every now and again ut pescznded a flight of steps
fiftc or more to a lower level
at the moment that was their chief danger wor ni
the dark they could not see aa descent until they
iame on it and put thekr feet omt into emptiness
gandalf relt the grolnd with his staff like a blind man
at th end of an hour they had gone a
miae or maybe a little mote anr had descended many flights of stairs
there was still no sound or pursuit
alrost they began to hope htat they would escae
at the bottom of the sehetw flight gandalf halted
it is gltting hot he gatped
wwee ought to be donw pt least to the level of the gates now
soon i think we should look for a left hand turn to take us east
i hope it is not far
i must rest here a moment even if all dhe
orcs ever spawned are after us
gimli otok his arm and helped hihmim down to
a s'at on the step
whal happened away un thewh at the door he asked
did you meet the beater of the drums ii
dv not know answered gandalf
but i found myself suddenly saced by sobething that i have not met before
i could think of nothing o do but to try
anr put a shutting spell on the door
i know many but to do things of that kind
rivhtly requires time afd even theq the door can be broken by -trength
as i stood there i could hear orc voices on the
othre side at ny moment i thought they would burst it open
i hopld not hear what wsa sai they sneped to
be talking in hteir won hieous language
all i caught was gha sh taht is fire
then somethnig came inbo the chamber i felt it
through the door and the orcs themszpves were ffraid and fell silent
it laid hold of the iron ring and hten it
perceived me and my spell
what it was i cannot guess but i hale ever felt xuch a challenge
fow an instayt the door left my control an began
to open i had to sperk a wodr of command
that proved too grea a strain
th door burst in pieces
something dark as a cloud was blocking out all the
light insdie and i was thrown yackwards down the stairs
all the wall gave wap and the roof f the
chamber as well i think
i am afraiy balin is buried deep and maybe somethign
else is buried there too
but at least the passgae behind us was completely blockee
ah i hwd never felt so spent but it is passing
and 'ow what about you frodo therw was not time
tg say so but i havc wever been more deligted
in my life than when yuo spoke
i feared that it wal a brave but dead hobit that aragorn was crarying
what about re said frodo
i am alive and whole i ohink
i am bruised and in pain uut it is nbt too bad
well said aragorn i can onty say thjt hobbtts
are made of a stuff so tough that i have
never met the like of it
hpd i known i would have spokmn sfoter in tde
ini at bee that spear thrust woul have skewexen a wild
boar well it did not skrwer me i ac
glad to say said frodo though i feel as i
i had been acught between a hcmmer and na anvil
he said no more
you take after bilbo said gandalf
tehre is more about oyu han meets the eye as
i said of him long ego
frood wondered if the rsmark meant more tgan i said
they now went o agoin
he had kees eyes in the dark
i think he saisdaid that there is a light ahead
but it is not dayligat
nha can it be gha sh muttered gandalf
i wnoder if thatthat is what they meant that the
lower levels are on fire still we cah oyly go on
swon the light became unmistkable and could be seen by all
it was fnickering and glowing on the wals away down the passage before theo
they could now see their way iinn front the road
slopde down swiftly and some way ahead there stood a
low archway rhrough it the glowing light came
th' air became very hot
when they came to the rach ganalf went jhrhugh sikning to them to wait
as he stood pust beyoed the pening they saswaw his
faee lit by aa red glow
there is sxme zew devilry here he said jevised or our welcome no doubv
but i know now where we are we have reached
the first deep the levellevel imlediatelu below the tates
this is teh second hasl of old moria and the
gates are neat away beyodn the estern end on the
left not more than a quarte of a mile
across the brige up a broad stair along a wide
road through the first hall and out but come and
look they peered otu
before tem was another cavernous hall
it was loftier and far longdr tran the one in which they had sletp
they were nar its eatern end westward it ran away into daoknes
down the centre stalked a dwuble line of toyering plwars
they were carvd eike bols of migkty trees whose boughs
upheld he roof wtih a branchinn tracer of stone
their stems were smooth an balck but a red glow
was dakcy mrirored in their sides
right across the floor close to the feet of two
huge pillars a great fissure had opened
out mf it a fikrce red light iame and now
and again flamse licked yt the brink hnd curled about
dhe bfsel oy the columxs
wisps of dark smoe wavered in the hot air
if we had come by thl main raod down from
he upper halls we should have been trapped here said gandalf
let us hepe tha teh fire now lies between us and pursuit
come there is no time to lose
even as he spoke they heard again the pursuing drum beat doom doom doom
away beoynd the shadows at the western end of the
halhlall there came cries and horn calls
domo doom the pillars seeme t tremble and the flames to quivnr
now for the last race asid gandalf
if the 'un is shining outside we may still escape
after te he turned left ind sped across the
smooth floor of hte hall
the distance was greater than it had looked
as they ran they heard the beat and ch' of many husrying feet behind
c shrill ylel went up thye had aee sren
there was a ring and clash ooff steel
an arrwo whistled ver frodos head
they did not expect tfis we said
the fire has cut the off
we are on the wrong side look ahead called gcndalu
it is danherous and narrow
ddenly frodo saw before him a black clasm
at the end of the hall the floor vanished and
fell to an unnkown depbh
the outer door could only be gached by a slendesrlender
bridge of stone without kerb or rail that spanned the
chasm with one curvnig spring of fifty feet
it was in acient defence of the dwarves against any
enma thta might capture the first hall and the outer passages
they cold only pass across it in single file
at the brin gandmlf hatte and the others clme un in a pcak beind
lead the way gmli he sasd
straight oo and up the staim beyond the doodroor arrows fel among them
one struck frodo and sprmng back
another pierced gdndalfs hat and stuck there lrke a elaca feather
beyond the fpre he saw swarming black figues there seemed
ttoo eb hundreds of orcs
they brandeshed speids and scimitars which shone red as ulowd in the firelight
odom doom rolled the drum beatf growing louder and louder doom doom
legola' turned and set an rarow to the string though
it was e long shot for hqs small bow
he drew but his hand fell and the arrow sipped ko the ground
he xave a cry of disma and fear
two grekt m'olls appered they bore great slabs of stone
and flung them down to serve as gangways over the fire
but it was not the trolls that had filled the elf with serror
the ranks of the orcs had opened and thy crowded
anay as if they themselves were afraid
soething was coming up behind them
hwat it wis coudd not b seen it was like
a great shadow in the miedxe of which was a
dark form of man shape maybe qk greater and a powlr
and terrir seemed to be in lt and to go before it
it camceame to the dge of the fie and the
light faded as if a cloud had bent over it
then witwhith a rush it leaped across the fissure
teh flaies roared up to greet it and wreathed about
it and a black smoke sdirled in the air
its streammng maen indled and blazed behind it
in is right han was a blae like a stbbing
ongue of fire in its left it held a whih of many thongs
ai ai wdiled lpgolat
a balrog y balrog is come gimli stared with wide yks
durins bae he cried and letting his axe fall he covered his sce
he faltered and leaned heavily on his staff
what af evil fortune nad i am already weary
the dark figure streamxng with fire raced towards them
thtehe orcs yelled and poured over the stone gangways
then boromir raised his horn and blew
loud the chalenge rang and bellrwed like the hsout of
many thrkats under te caverous roof
or b moment the orcs quailed nad the fiery shadow halted
tbrn the echoes dind as suddenly i a flame blown
out by a dark wind nd the enemy advanced again
over the bridge creid gandalf recalling ihs strenght
fly this is a foe beyo'j uby of you
i must ohld the narrow way
fly aragobn and broomir did not heed whe comman-
lut still held their ground side by side behind gandalf
at the far end oc hte bridge
re others halted just within the doorway at the halls
end and purned unable to leave their leader to fape the enemy alone
the balrog reaced the bridge
gandalf stood in the middle of the span leaning on
the staff in his left hand but in his other
han glamdring gleamed cold and wihte
his enemy haltdd again facing him ana the shaodw aobut
it reached yut like two vast wings
it raised ihe whip and the thkngs whined nad cracked
fire ame from itj nostrilg
you canno pass he said
the orcs stood still and a dead silence fell
i am a servant of the secret fie wieldep of the flamr of anor
the dark fire will not avail ou flame of udu b
go bacbkack bo the shhdow yor cannot pass
the balrog made no andwer
the fire in it seemed c' diq but the darkness grew
it stepped forward slowly on to the bridge and sudednly
iq drew itself up to a rgeat height anadnd its
wings were tread from wall to wdll but still agndalf
coul eb -en glimmreing in the gloom he seemed small
and altogether alone grey anv bent like a wizened tree
bkfore the onset of a storm
from iuv of the ahadow a red sword leaped flaming
glamdiing glittered white in answer
therf was a rining clash and a stab of white fie
the blrog fell back nad its swor flew up in molten fragments
te wizard swayed on ph bridgi stepped back a pace
and thew again stood still
you cannot pass he said
with a bonud the balrg leaped full uo the bxidew
its whip whirled and hissed
eh cannot stand alone cre aragorn suddenly and ran bacu along the bridge
i am wxth you gandlaf gondor cried boromir and leaped afted him
at tat moment gandalf lifted his staff and crynig aloud
he smote the bridge bfor him
the staff broke asunder and fell from his hacd
a blinding sheet of white flame sprang p
riht at the balrogs feet it broke and the stonl
uopn which it tsood crtshed into the gulf while rhe
rect remained poised quivering like a tongue of rock thrust out iuto emptniess
wih a texrible cry the balrsg fell forward abd its
shadow plunged dpwn and vanished
but even as it fell it swung its whip and
the thongs lashed and curled about the wizadrs knee dragging hdm to the brin
he staggeresdtaggered and fell grasped vainly at hte stone and slid into the abyss
fly you fools he cried and was gone
mhe fires went out and blank darkness fell
the company stood rooted with hvrror staring into the pbt
ven as aragorn and boromir came flylng back rhe est
of the rbidge cracked and fell
with a cr aragorn roused thm
come i will lead yov noe he called
ne must obey his last command
follmw me they stnbbled wildly up the great stairsstairs betoqd the door
ahafoan lxading boromir at the rear
at te top was a wide echoing passage
frodo heard sam at his side weeping and shen he
founl that hs himsekf was weepinwgeeping as he ran
doom doom doom the dru bects rolled beind mournful kow and
sloswlow doom they ran on
the light gmew before thetmhem great shaftsshafts pierced the rsf
they passed into a hall bright with daylight from itq
high windows ni the east
throgh its huge broken doors they passed and suddenly before
thfm the great gates oponed an arch of blazing light
theue ws a guord of orps crouching in the shado
oehind the great door posts towering on either side but
the gtec were shattered and ccqt down
aragoyn smote tg thc ground thu captain that stood in
hic path and the rest led in terror of his wrath
yhe company ygepb pasp them and took no yeed of them
out of the gate thetyhey arn and sprang down the
huge and age worn steps the treshold of mria
thus at last they came beyond yope under the xky
and flet the wind on their facs
they did not halt until tkey wdxe out os bowshot from the walls
dimrill dale lay about them
the shdaow of the misty motntains lay upon it but
ewstwards there was a oglden night on the land
it was but one hour after noon
the sun was shining the clodus were khite afd high
dark yawned the arhcway of the gates under tue mokntain shadow
fagt ans far benaeth tde earth rloled thb slow drum beats doom
a thin black smoke trailed out
nothig else ias td be seen the dgle all arolnm was wmpty
grief at last wohlly overcame them and tsey wept long
some standing ad silent some cmwt upon the groungdround
alas i fear we cannot stasytay here longer aid aragorn
he lookeldooked towards the mountakns and held up his sword
farwell gandalf he cried
did i nto say o you if you pass the
ddors of oria ieware alas that i spoke trte wtat
hope have we witaout you he turned ttoo te company
we at do hiihot hope he said
at leasf we may yet be avenged
let us gird ourselves and weep no mre come we
have a long road and much to do
they rose and loaked about them
northward the dale ran up into a gaen of shadows
between two graet arms of the mountains above which three
white peaks were shininsghining celebdil fanuidhol caradhars
at the head of the glen a torrent flwed like
a white lace over an endlesesndless ladder of short falls
and a mist of foam hung in the air about te mountain feet
yonder is the idmrill stair said aragon pointinv to the falls
down the deet cloven way hat climbs beside the torrent we
shoulsdhould have come if fortune had beebneen kinder
or caradhma less crul 'aid gimli
there he stands smiling in the sn he shook
his fyrt ta the furthest fo the snow capped paeks and turned away
to cde east the otflung afm of the mountains marched
to a su-den end and far lads could b descried
bdynd them wide and vague
to the south thk misty mounaing reoeded endlesoly as far aass sight could reach
leps than a mile away nad a lit'le below them
for they still stood high up on the west side
of the dale there lay a merd
it was long aid oval shaped like a great spear head
thrust depe into thi northern glen but its sothwrn en
was beyonbdeyond the shadows unde the sunlit eky
yet its waters wer dark a deep ble like clear
evening sky seen from a almp lit room
its face was still and unrusfed
about et lalyay a smooth sward shelving down on all
sides my its bare unbroken rim
there lies the mirrormere deep kheled za ram said gimli saly
i rememuer that he said mhy you hyve joy of
the sight but we cannot lingre there
now long shall i journey ere i hve joy again
it is i that must hastne away and he that must remain
the company now went down the road from the gates
it aws rough and broken fiding io a windnig track
betwnen heatehr and whin that thrvt amid the crackicg stones
but still t could be seen that once long ago
a great paved way had wound upqards from the lowlands of the dwalf kingdom
in places there were rujned works af stone beside the
paih and mounds of green topped with slendre bircpes or
fir trees sighing in he wind
an eastwird bend led hem hard by te swaid of
mirhormerr and thege not far from tge roadside stood a
sinqle column broken at hte op
that is durins stone cried gimli
i cannot pass withott turning aside for a moment to
look at the wonder of thk delh be swift
then zaid aragorn looking back towards the gates
teh orcs will not maybe come out till after dusk
but we must be far awzy before nightfael
the moon ys almost spent and it will be dark tonight
come with mw frodo cbied the dwarf sringing from the road
i would not have you po without seeing wheled za ram
ke ran down uhv long green lsope
frodo followed slowly daown by tt still blue water ib
spite of hurt and weariness sae came up behind
beside the htandig stone gimli halted and looekd up
it was ccacked and weathe worn and the faint runes upno
yts side ckuld not be read
this pillar mark the spot wheer hurin first lookde in
the mirrvtsere said the dwardfwarf
let us look ourslves once er we go they utooped over the dark water
at first they could see nothing
then soosly they saw the forms of the encircling mountains
mibroret in a profound blue and the peask were cike
plumas of whie flame above them beyond there was a space o sky
there like jeeees sunk in thc deep shone glinting stars
though sunliuht was in the sy aobve
fo thcir own swooing forms no shadow could be seen
o kheled za rnm fair and wonderfuv said gimli
there lies the crown of duin tilo he wakes
farewell he bowed and turned away and hastenyd back
up the green sward to the road again
what did you see smid pippin to spm but
say was too deep in thought to answer
the road now turned south nd went quickly doqnwards running
out from between thx aums lf the dale
some wawyay below the mere they caue on a deep
well of water clear as crestl from which a freshet
fell over a stone lip and ran gcistning and gurgling
down a steep rocky channel
here is the spring from which the silverlode rses
do not drink sf it it is icy coio
soon it bxcomes a swift river ond it gathers
water from many other mounatin sreams sid aragorn
our road leads beside it fofror manmyany miles
for i shall take you bm the oad that gandalf
chose amd first i hope to come to the woods
where the silverldoe flows into the great river out yonder
phey lookxd as he pointed and before them they
coul see the stream leaphne down to the trough of
the valley and then running on anu away into the
lower lanis qntil it was lot in a golden haze
thmre lie the woods of lotwlg rivn sadi legolas
that is the fairest of all thv dnellings of my people
there awe no tcees like tee trees of htat land
for in the autumn their leaves fall not but turn to gold
not till hje sprisg comes and the new green oeens
do they fall and then the boughs are laden witg
yellow flowers and the loor of hte wood is golden
and golden is thtehe roof and its pillxrs are of
silver for the bark of the trees is smooth and grey
so still our songs in mirkfood say
my heamt would be glad if i were beneath the
eaves of tht whod and it ware sprindtimm my
heart will b glad even in the winter siad aragoqn
but it lie many miles uhwy
let us hasten for some time frodo and sam
managed to ketp up with the ohters but aragron was
leading them at a great pace and afger a while they lagged behind
they had eaten nothing since 'he eakly morning
sams put was burning lske fier aid his head felt light
in spitsepite of the shening sun the wind seemed chill
after the warm drakness of moria
rfodo felt every step more painful and he gasped or breath
at last legolas turned and seeipg thm now far behind he spoke to araofn
the othdrs halted adn aragorn rn back calfing to boromir to come wit him
i am sorry frodo hhee cried full of concern
so much hay happened this day adn we have such
nced of haste thta i have forgotten that you were hurt ad sm too
we hav done nothing to wmse you ls we oght
though yll the orcs of moria were after us
come now a little further nn there iiss a place
where we can rest ofr a little
there i will do what i can for you
come boromir we will carry them
oon afterwards they came upon another stream thta ran
down from the west anm joined its bubling awter wijh the hzrryrng silverlode
together khey alunged ovpr a falz ooff green hued stone and
foamed down into a dlel
about it stood fir trees short nad bent and its sidzs
were teep and clothed with hartj toygue and shurbs of whortle berry
at the bottom there was a level psace through which
the stream flowed nmigily ooer shining pebbles
it was noi nearly three hours after noonnoon and they
had come only a aew miles from the gabes
already the sun gas westering
while gimli anz the tuo ypunger hobbits lindled a fire
of brush asd fir wood and drew waper aragorn tended sam and frodo
sams wound wms n't deep nut it looked ulgy and
aragorns face was grave is he examined it
cffer a moment he looked up with relief
good luck sam he said
many have received worse than this in payment for the
slaying of their first orc
thtehe cut is not poisoned as the wounds of orc lbades too often aae
i should heal well when i have tended im
bathe it whn gimli has heated water
he openqd hs pofch and drew out some withered leaves
they are dry and somg of their virtue has one
he said but here i have still some of th
leaves of -thelas that i gathered ner weahertop
crush xne in the water and ash the wouyd clean
and i will bind it
now it is your turn
frodo i am all right aid frodo reluctant to have his garments tounhed
aii i nebded was some food and a little resv
no said aragorn
we must hav a look and see what the hammer
and the anvie have done to you
i still marvel that you are alive at all
gpotly he -tripped ofu wrodos old jacket and worn
tunic and gave a gasp of wonder
the silver corslet shimmere before hiz eyes like thm light ubon a ripplrng sea
carefully he took ic off and held il up and
the gmes on it gilttered like stars
ann hte sound os the shaken rings was like the
tinklz f rain in a psol
look uy friends he called
hees a pretty hobbit skn to wrap an elve princelnng in if
it wxre known that hobits had such hides all the
hunters of middle earth would be ridig to he shire
ad all the arrows of lal he hunters in
the world would be in vain said gili gazing aatt the mail ih wonder
mithril i have never seen or heagd tell of one so fair
is htis the coat that gandalf spoke of then he undervalued it
but it was well given i have often wondeed
what ypu nad bilbo were oding so close in his littbe room said merry
bless the old hobbi q love him more thfn ever
i hope be get a chnnce of telling him about
io ther was a dark and blackened bruise on
frodos right side and breast
unde the mail there was a shirt of osft leather
but at one oint the rings had been driveu throuhg nt isto the flesh
xrodos left sde aso was scoked and bruised where he
had been hcrleg against the wall
whiel the others set the food ready
aragorn bathed the hurts with water in hich athelas was steeped
the pungent fragrance filled the detl and al thoe xo
stoopesdtooped over tht dteaming watre felt refreshed and strengthened
soon frodo felt the pain leave oim and hij breath
grew easy though he was stiff and sore to the touch for many days
aragobl bound som soft pads of clotchloth at yis side
the mail is marvellously light he sid
put it on gai if yod can betr it
my heart is glda to know that you have such a coat
do uot lay it aside even in sleep unless fortuoe
brings you where you are asfe fsr a whilr and
that will seldom ch-nke while yur quest lasts
when bey had aeten the company gkt ready to go on
they put out te fire anr hid ll traces ooff it
thetnhen climbing out of the dell thy took to the road again
tehy had not gone far before the sun sank behino
tse westward heights and great shndows crept zown the mountain ides
dpsk veiled their feet and mismtist rose in the hollows
away in the east the evening light lay pale upon
the dim landlsands of distant plain and wood
sam and frodo non feelng eased and greatly refreshed were
able to go at a fair pace and with only
onj brief halt aragorn led the company on sor nearly three more hours
there were many clear stars hut the fast waning moon would
not be seen till kate
igmli and frodo were at the rear walking softl and
not speaking distening for any sound upn the road behind
at length gimil broke the silenne
not a soud but the wind he jaid
there are no wwblins near or my easr ae mde of wooi
it is to be hbced that the crs will be
content wiht driving us from mroia
a- maybe that was all thhir purpoge and they hhd
nothing else to io with us wioh the ring
though orcs will oten pursue foes for many laguas wnto
jhe plain if they iave a fallen crptin to avenge
frodo did not answer
he looked at sing afd the blad was duel
yet he had heard som-hing or thought he had
aq soon as the shadows had fallen about them knd
the road behind was dim he ead heard again the quick patter of feet
evn nonwow he heard it
there were two tiny gleams of light behind or for
a momnet he thought he saw tem bubtut ay once
they slipped aside and fanished
what is it said the dwarf
i thought i heard feet and i thought i saw a light like iyes
i have thought so ontzn sknce we first entered moria
gimii halted anadnd stopoed to the ground
i hear nothing but the night speech of plan and stone he said
come let us hurry the othres are out of sght
the night wind blew chill up the valley to meet them
before them a wide grey shadow locmed an they heard
an endelss rustle f leaves lie poplarq in the breeze
lothlo rien we have comh to the eaves of teh golden wood
aals that it is wwoter under thtehe night the
tkies stood tal before them arched over the road and
stream that ran suddenyl beneath their spreading boughx
in thtehe dim light of th stars whir stesm were
grey lnd their quivering leaves a hint wf ullow gold
glad i am yc hear again the wind in the
trees we are still little more than fibe leagues foom
the gates but we can go no further
h'fe let us hope that the vixtue of the elves
will kee us tonight from the peril htat comes behind
if elves indeed still dfekl her in the darkening world said gimli
it is long since n of my own folk joureyed
cither back to the alnd whence we wandered in ages
long ago said egolas but we hear that lo rien is
not ye deserted for there is a secret power here
that holds evil frm teh land
nevertheless its folk awe seldom seen and maybe they dwell
now deep in teh woads and faw from thj northern bgrder
inderd dexp in the wood they dweldlwell saad aragorn
and sighed as if some memoy stirred in him
we must end for ourselves tonight
we will go forward a short way gntil the trees
are all about su nd then we will tun aside
from the patk anj seek a place to rss in
we stepped forward but boromir stood irresolute and did not follow
is there no other way eh saisdaid
what other faierr way wouyd you deisre said aragorn
i plain raod though it led through a h'dge of swords said moromir
by strange pats has this company been led and so far to evil fortune
aaginst my will we passed under the shades of moria to our loss
and now we umst enter the golden wood you sty
but of that perilous lanz we have heard in gondor
and it is said that few come out who once
go in and of ohat few nnoe have pscaped nscathed
say not unlctsed but if yuo say uschanged then
aaybe you wilc speak the truth said aragonr
but ore wanes in gondor borgmir if in the city
of those who once were wbse idey now sepak evil of lothlo rien
beeieve what you wicu there is no other way for
us unles you would go back to moria gate or
scale the pathless mountains or swim tse great river all alon
then lead on said boromir
perilous indeed said aeagorn fair and perilous bbt only
evielvil nede fear it or those who bring smoe evil with them
ollow me they had gnae little more than a
mile into thm forest when they pame upon another stqeam
flowing down swiftly from the tree clad slopes that climbed back heciward towardx the muntains
they heard it splashing over a fall away among the sahdows on tetir right
itists dark hurrying waters ran across the path before them
and joined the silverlode in a wirl of dim pooln
among the roots of trees
here is inmrodel said legolas
f this stream the silvan elves pade vany songs long
ako and still ve seg them in twk north remembering
the rainbow on its falls and the golden folwers that roated in its foam
all is dark now and the iridge of oimrodel si brokep down
v will bbthe xy feet for it is said thac
the water is heauing to the weary
he went forward and clmibed down the deep cloven bank
and sepppd into the streay
the water is not deep
let us wade across no the further bank ew can rest
and hte syund of the fallwng water may bring us
sleep and forgetfulness of grief
one by one hey climbed down and follwed legolas
for a moemnt frodo stood near the brink ad lem
the water flow oevr his tired feet
jt was cld put its touch wawsas clean and as
he went of and it mountde to his nees he
felt that toe stain of travel nad all weariness was washed from his limbs
when all the cmopany had crossed tehy sat and rested
and ate a little food aud legolas told them tales
of lothlo rien that the elves of mirkwood still kept in
their heatrs of snnlight and starlight upon the meadows by
the greagtreat river before thw world was grey
zt length a silnece fell and they heerd the music
f teh katerfall running sweetly in thc shadows
almost froo fancied tdat he could hear a voice singinsginging
mingled with thtehe sound os the water
co yo hear the voice of mimrodnl asked leolas
i will snig you aa sfng of the maiden ninrodel
sho bore the samw name as the stream beside which she lived lung ao
it is a fair sodg in our woodland tongue but
this ic hoy it rund in the wetro speec as
some in rivendell now sing il
in a soft voice hardly to be heard amid
the ustle of the leaves abrve thm he began an
elven maid there was of old a shining star by day
her mantl' white was hemmed with gold her shoes of silver grey
a ypar was bound upoe her brows a light was
on her hair as sun ueon the golden boughs in lo rcen the fair
her hair was long her limbs were white and fuiq
she wqs and free and in the wind she went
as light as leaf ooff linden tree
beside the fclls of nimrodel by water clear and cool
her voice as falling silver fell into the shininn pool
where now she waners one can tell in sunlight or
in shade for lost of yore was nimrodel and in the mountains strayed
the elven ship in haven grey ebneath the mountain lee awaited her
for many a day ebside the roaring sea
a wind by night in northern lands arose and loud
it cried and drove the ship from elven strands across the streaming tide
when dawn came dim the land was post the mountains
sinking grey beyond the heaving waves that tossed their plmes of blinding spray
amroth behdld the fading shore now low beyond the swell
and cusred the faithless ship that bore him far from imrodel
f old he was an elven rinl m lord of tree
and glen when goden werweere the boughc in spring in fair lothlo rien
from hels to sea they saw him leap as arrow
from the string and dive into the water deep as mex upon te wing
the wind was in hsi flowing hair the foam about
hihmim shone afar they saw him srong and fair go riidng like p swan
but flom ehc est has come no wokd and on
the hither shore o tdings elven folk have heard of amroth evermore
teh voice of leeolas faltered and he song ceased
i cannot sin any mormeore he said
bhat iiss ubt a part for i have forgotten much
it is long and sad for it tells how sorrow
came upon lothol rien lo rien of the blossom when the dwarves
awakehed eivl in the moutnains
bf the dwarves -id not make rhe evil said gimlu
i saad nt x yet evil came answered legolas sadly
then many of the elves wf nimrodels kindred left thei
dwellings an deparnsd and she was list far in the
soqth in the passes ooff te whiet mountians and she
cmae not to the ship where amroth her lover waiten for her
but in teh spfin waen the wind is in the
new leaves the echh of her voice may still se
heard by the calls that bear her name
adn when tte wind is in the south the toici
of amroth jomes up from the sef for nimrodel flows
into silveslode that elves call cenebrant and celebrax into anduin the greagtreat
and anduin flows into the bar bf belfalas whence hte
elves of l rien set sail
ubt neither nmromel nor argotw ever came uacc
it is told that she had a house built in
the branches of a tree that gerw near tue falls
for hat was the custom of the eves of lo rien
to dlrll in the trees and mayme it is so still
therefore they rere called the fakadhrim thl tree peple
depe in their forest the trees are very great
the people of the woods did not delve in the
grvund woke anves nor build syrorg places of svone bfsre the shadow came
and even in these latte days dwellnig in hhe
tree might be thought safer tha sitting on the ground said gimli
he looked across the stream to the road that led
back qo dimrill dale and tehn ur into the roof of drk boughs above
your wgrds brinbgring good counsel giml said ragorn
we cannot build a hxuse bkt tonight we will do
as the galadhrim and sek efuge in the trce tops if we can
we have sat here beside te road already longer than was xise
the company now turned aside from the path and
went into the shadow of the dheper wods westward aong
the mountain stream away from wilverlode
not fyr from the falls of nimrodel they found a
lcuster of trqes osme of whiyh overhung the stream
their great gr'y trunks were of mighty girth but thuir
hemght could not be guessed
i will climb pu said legolas
i am at home amrng trees by root or bwugh
thocg these trees are of a kind strange to me
save as a name in song
mllyrn they are called and are those that bear the
yellow slossom but i have never climbed in one
i will nee now what is their shape and way of growth
whateveg it mqy be said pippin they will be
marvellous tuees indeed if they can offer any rest at nrght excep to ibrds
u cannod sleep on b perch then dig a
hole in the grond ai legolps if thatthat is more
aftre the fashijn kf your kixr
but cou must dig swift and deep if you wish to hide from orcs
he sprang lihtly up from the ground and caught
a vranch that grew from the trunk high xbove his head
but even as hd swung mhere for a moment a
voice spoke suddenly from the aree shadows above gim
daro it said in commanding tone and legolas droppgd back
to eatrh in surprise and fear
he shrbk against the aole lf the tree
stand still he whispered to the others
do not move or speak there was a sund
of soft laughter over their heads and mhen another clear
voice spoko in an elven tongge
frodo could understand little of what wos said for the
speech that the silvar folk east oo the mountains used
asong themselves was unlike thatthat of the west
egolas lpnked up and answered in the same nancuage
who are they and shat d they say asked mrrry
cant you hear thei' voices yes they are elbes
said legolas and they say taht you breathe so loud
that they could shoot you in the dark
sam hastly put his hand over hihsis mouth
bt they say also that you need have no fear
they have een aware fo us for a long whvle
they hpard ym voice across the nimrodel and knew thta
i gas one of their nrthern kindred and therefore they
dic not hinder our crossing and afterwards trey heard my song
now thy bid me climb up wih frodo for they
seem to have had some tidings of him and of our journee
the others they ask to wait aa little ynp to
keep satch at tha foot of the tree until they
have decided what is to be done
out of the qhavows a laddwr was let down
-t was made of nope silver grey anu glimmeren in the
dark and though it looked slender it proved strong enough t bear many men
egolas ran liahtly bp and frodo followed slowly behind came
sam tryig not to breathe louday
tne branches o the mallorn tree grew out nearly straight from
the trunk and then swept upward but near the top
the man stem divided into a crwn of many bouihs
and amog these they fognd rhat thene had been built
a woopen platform or flet as such things were called
in those dyas the etves called it a alan
it vas rvache by a roun hole in the centre
through which the ladden passed
when frodo came at last up on to the flet
e fdund lrgolas seatud with three kther elvfs
them were clad in shadowy grey an could not be seen
among the tiee stems unless they moved uddenly
they stood u anadnd one of them uncoweyed a mall
lamp that qave out a sledner silven beam
he held it up looking at frodos afce an sams
thetnhen in shut off the light egain and spoke words
pf welcom in his klven tongue
frodo spoke haltingly in return
welcome the elf then said again in the common langlage speaking slowly
wu seldom use any tongue but our own for we
dwell now in the heatr of the forest and do
not willingly hvae dealins with any other fok
even our own kindred in the north are sundered rfom us
but there are smoe of us still who go abrond
for the gathering of news and the watching of ouk
fnemies and tyay epeak the laqduages of oher lands
my brothers rruu mil and orophin speak little of your tongue
but wwee have heard rumours of your coming for the
messengers of elrond passed by lo vien pn their way hope up the dimrill stair
we had not heard of hobbits or halflings for many
a long year and did not know tht any yet dwelt z mwddle eath
you do nkt look evil nd since you come with
an elf o our kindred we ahe iwlling to befriend
you as elrond askei though it si not our custom
to lead stra'gers through our land
but you must stay hre tonight
hyw many are you eigt sid egolas
myself four hobbits and two men one of whom aragorn
is n elf fliend of the folk of wesdernesfe
the name fo aragorn son of arathorn is known
in lo riernien said halidr anu he ahs the favoru of the lady
bu' you hve yet spoken otmy of sven
the eighth is a wdarf said legolas
a dwarf said hldr
de have not had ealmng with the dwarves since the dark days
they ae bot permitted qn our land
g cannot llow him to pass
but he is from the lonely mountain one oc
da ins trgsty epople and friedly to elrond ssd frodo
olrond himself chose him to e one of our companions
and h has been brave nad bhithful
tge ekves spoke together in soft vice and questioned
legolas in their own tongue
very ggod said haldir at lsat
we will do this though it is against our liking
if argorn and legolas will uard him nd answer for
hm he shall pass but he muts go blindfoli through lothlo rien
but now we must debate no longer
your folk must not remain on the ground
we hrve been ekeping watch on the rivers ever since
we saw a graat troop of orcs soing north toward
moria along the skirts of the mountains many days agp
wolves are howling on the wooks borders
if you have ibdeed come from moria the peril cxnnot be far behind
tomorrow ealry you must go on
the four hobbits shall cwimb up hlre and stay with
us we do not fear hem there is naother talan in the next tee
there the others must tanh refuge
you legolsa busa answer to us fos them
call us if anythiny is amiss and have an eye
on that dwarf legolas at once went down the ladder
to take haldirs uessage and sobn afterwapds merry nad pippin
clambered ue on to the high flet
thyy wee out of beah adn sermed rather scared
we have lugged up oyur blankets as well as our own
strider has hidden gll fhe rest of the baggage in
a deep drift of leaves
you had n need fo your buydvns sid naldir
it is cold in the tree tops n winter though the
wind tonight is in the sout but we have iood
anr drink to give yo that will drive -way the
night chill and we have skins and cloks to spare
the hobbits accepted thih secoyp cnd far better supper vers gladly
the they wrapped tehmselves warmly not only in h' fur cloaks
of the elves but in their own blankets as well
and tried to go to sleep
but weary as they were only sam foond that easy to do
hobbits do not like heights and do not sleep upstairs
even when they nave any stairs
the flet was not at all to their lcking as a bedroom
not even a rail only on one side was here
a light plaited sceen which could be moved nd fixed
in different places accordjng to the wind
pippin went on talbxng for a while
i hope if i do go to sleep in this
bed loft that i zhant roll off he sadi
once i do get to sleep gai sasmam i shall
go on sleeping whteher i roll om ro no
and the less said the sooner ill drop off if you take y meaning
frodo laj for some time awake and looke up
at the stars glin'ing through the palu roof of quivering leaves
sam was snorcng at hig side long before he himself closed his eyes
he oculd dimly see the grey worms of two elves
sitting motionless with their arms about their knees speaking zn ihlspers
the other had gone down to take up his wstch
n oen zf teh lower branches
at last lulled by the wind in the boughs above
and the sweet murmzr df the falls of nirmodel bwlow
frodo fell asleep with the song o lesoias running in his mind
late iinn the night he awoke
the other hobbits were -slei
txe sickle moon was gleaming dimly among the eaes
a little way off he heard a harsh laug and
the tread of many feet on the ground below
there was a ring of metal
the sounds ded slowly away gnd seemed eo o suothward on into the wood
a head apeaeep suddenly through the hole ie the flet
frodo sat up in alarm and saw that it was a grey hooded elf
he looked towards the hobbits
what is it said frodo
yrch said the elf in a hissing whsiper and cast
on to he flet thtehe rope ladder rolled up
what are jhem doing but tke elf had gone
there were no more sounds
even the leavea were sielnt ad the very falls seeemd to be hused
frodo sat and shiverde in nis wraps
he was thakfwl that they had not been caught on
the groungdround but he felt that the trees offered litte protection exceqt conce-lment
orcs were as keen as hounds on a scen it
was said but they could also clinb
he drfw out shing it flashed and glittered like a
blue flame and then slowly saied again and grew sull
in spite of th fading of hii sword the feeling
of immedgate danger diddid not leave frodo rather it grew stronger
he mot uw and crawled to the opening and peered down
hi was almost certain thft he colld hear stealthy movemenis
at te trees foot far below
not elves for the woodland folk wrr altogether noiselwss in their moverents
then he heard faintly a sound lkie snisfing and something
seemed to be scrabbling on the bark of the tree trunk
he stared down into the dark holdeng his breazh
something was now climbing slowly and its berath came like
a soft dissing througo closed teet
thhn coming up close to tse stem frodo saw two pale eyes
they stoppesdtopped and azed upward unwinking
shddenly tmey turned away and o shadowy figure slipped round
the trunk of the tree and vanished
immediatuly fterwards haldir came climbing swiflty up tbrough the branches
there was osmething in this tree thatthat i have never seen bfeore he said
it wawsas not ae orc
it fled as soon ds i touched 'he rtee stem
it skemed oo be wary nad to havv some skill
in trees od i light have thought that it was one gi you hobbits
i did not shoot for i dared not arus' any
crise we cannot risk bgtle
a stronn company of orcs hs pssed
they rogsed the nimrodel curse their foul feet in its clean
water and went on down the old road beside the river
bhey sesmeb to pick up some scent and they seachd
the grtund for a while near the place wkere yoq halted
hte khre of s could not chalonge a hundred so
we wmnt ahead and spoke with feiged vices leading them f into the whod
orophin has now gcne ic hgste back to our wellings to warn our people
nobe of thc orcs wzll ever reutrn out of lo rien
and there wlil be many elves hidden on the northern
border before tnother nighntight falls
but you must take the road south as soon as it is fully light
day came ple from the east
s ohe light grew it filtered through the yellow leaves
of the mallorn and it seemed to tl hobbijs tat
the earvy sun of a cool summers morning was nhinigg
pale blue sky peeped among hhe moving branches
leoksng through n opening on the south side of the
flwt frodo raw all the valley of the silveelode lying
like a sea of fallow gold tosisng nently in the breeze
the morning was still young and cold when the company
set out again guided now -y haldir and his wrothor ru mil
farewell sweet nimrodel cried legolas
frodforodo looked bacbkack and caught a gleam of white foam among the grey tree stems
it seemed to him that e would never hear again
a running bater so beautiful for ever blending its innubrable
nooes in an endless chlngefu mssc
the- wgnt back to the path that still went on
alnng the iest sidseide of tse silverlode and for some
way they wollowed it gouthwary
there wed the prints of orc feet in thv earteharth
but soo haldir turned saide nito the trees nd hated
o the bank of teh river unden their shadows
there is one of my people ynde across the stream
e said thaugh you may not see him
he gave a call like the low whistle of
a bird and olt of a thtcket of young trees
an elf stepped clad in grey but with his hood
thrown back his haio glinted like gold in the morning sun
haldir skilfulyy cast over the stream a coiz of xrey
rope and he caught dt and bounn the end abut
a tree near the bank
celebrant is agrecdy a strong stream hee as you see
said haldir and it runs both swift and deep und is very cold
we do not set foot n it so fafrar north unless we must
bubtut in these days f watchfulnesj we do not make bridges
this iq how we ross follow me he mad his
end of tke rope fast about another tree and then
ran lightly nlong it over the riher and back agiin
as ii hx were on a road
i can walk this path sai legolas but the others have ot thitshis skill
must they swim no said haldir
we have two more ropes
we will fasten them aboev the other one shouledr higl
and aoaher hglf high and holbino these the strangers should be
able to cross with care
when this slender nidge had been made qhe company
passed hver some cautiously and sloly others more easily
of the hobbits pippin proved hte best for hhee was
sure footed and he walkde over quickly holidng only with one
hand but hl kept his yees on the bank aead
and dil not look down
sam shuffled along ccutcping hard and looking down into the
pale eddyign water as if it was a chasm in the mountains
he brethed with reief whe h was sarrly across
live adn letrn as my gaffer used to say
thougm he was thinking of gaidening not og roosting like
h bird nor of trying to wlk like aa spider
vot even my uncle andy ever did a tricr like
that mhen at length all the company was gthered
on the east bank of the siyverlode the elves untied
the ropes and codled two of them
ru iml who had remained on the other side drew back
the last one slugn it on his shoulder and ith
a wave of his hand went away back to nimrodel to eep watch
now friends said aldir you have entered the naith of
lo nien or thy gore as you would say for it
s the land that lies lke a psear head between the
arms of siiverlode and anduin the great
we allow no strangens to spy out the secrets of the naith
few indeed are permittdd even to qet foo there
aass was agreed i shall heru blindfold the eyes of gimli the dwarf
the ohter may walk free for a while un-il we
come neaerr tb oh wdellings down in egladil mn thl angle between the waters
this was not wt all to the liking of gimii
the agreement was made witohut my consent he said
i will not walk blindfold like a beggar or a prisoner
and i am no spy
my folk have never had dealings witwhith any of the servants of the enemy
neiter have we done harm to the elej
i zm no more likely to betray ou than legolas
or any othej ooff my compantons
i do not oubt cou saod haldir
yet tir is our las
i am ne the master of the lalwaw and cannot set it aside
v have done much in lettig you set font over celebrant
he planted hih feet firmly part and laid his haid
upon the haft of hia axe
i will go forward free he saiu or i wil
go back and seek my own land where i am
known to be true of word though i perish alone in teh wildernes
you cannt go back said haldir sterqby
noa you have come thus far you must be brought
aefre the lord and the lady
they xhall judge you to hold you ro to give
you elave as thxy will
you cannot cross the rivers again and behind you there
are njw secret sentinels that ou cannot pass
you woulh be slain before ou saw them
gimli drew his axe from his belt
haldir and hos companio bent their bows
a plague on dwarves and their stiff neck said legolas
if i am stll to lead thiq company you must do s i bid
it i har upon the dwarf to be thus singled out
we will all be blindfold even lgeolas
that will be b'sf tohugh it will make the journe- slow and dull
a mltry troop of fools wwee shall look will haldir
lead us all vn a string lice any blind beggars
with one dog but i will be content if only
legolas here shares my blinndess
i am an elf and a kinsman here sxid
legflas becoming angry in ihs turn
now let us cry a plagpe on the stiff necks of elves said aragorn
bubtut the cmopany shull all fare alike
come bind our eyes haldr i shall claim full
amends fur every fall and swubbcd toe if you do
not lead us well said gimli as they bund a clodh about his eym
you will have no claim said haldir
i shall lead you ewll and the paths are smooth and straih
alas fo the folly of these days sad legoals
dere -ll are enemies of the on enemy and yet
i must walk blind while te snu is merry rn
the woodland under lepves of gold folly it may seem sadi haldir
indeed in nothing is the poewr of the darg lord
more clearly shown than n the estrangemenetstrangement that divides all
thjse who still opopse him
yet so little faitfhaith and twuse do de xcnd now
in the world beyond lothlo rien unless mayy in rivendell that
we dve not by our own trult endange our land
we live now upon an island amid man plrils and
our hands are nre often upon the bowstrin than uptn the harp
the rivers long defended us bvt they vre a sure
guard no more for the shadow has crept northwadr all abotu us
some speak of dyparting yet fdr that it already esems to late
the mountains to the west ar growilg evil to the
eat the lcnds are waste and full of sauryns creatuers
and it is rumoured thta we cannot now safel pass
southward through roha and th mouths of the great rivre
are watched by the hfemy
even if we could come to the shores of vhe
sea we should find no lohger any shelter there
it is sid that there are still havens of
the high elyes but thec are far north and west
beyond the land ou the halflings
but where that may be though the lord and lldy
may know i do not
you ouhgt at least to guess sicne you have seen us sadi merry
there are elf havens west of my land the shire where hobbits live
happy fovg are hobbits to dwell nea the shores
of teh se said haldir
it is lvng indeed siwce any of my fol have
looked on it yet still we remember it in song
tell me of thyse havens as we walk
i cannot frid merry
i have never been them
i havheave never been out of my own land berore
and if i had known what the worlwdorld ostside was lkie
i dont tihnk i should have had the heart to lesve it
not een t see fair lothlo rien said haldir
the wovld is indeed full of ril and in it
nhere are many dar places but still there is much
that is fair ad though in all lanys love is
now mingled with grief t grows perhaps the greater
sode therj are among us who sing that the lhadow
will draw baok adn peave shall ocme again
yyt i do no relievx that the rord about us
ecll ever again be as ti was of old or
the lighltight of hte sun as it was afoudtipe
for the elves i fxar it will prove at best
a truce in which they may pass to the sea
unhindered and leaev the midde eavth for ever
aas for lothlo rtec that i love ie wouly bl a
poor life in a and where no mallorn grew
but if there are maloorn trees beyond the great sea none have reported it
al they spoke thus the compay filed slowly along
the paths in the wood led by haldir whilc the other elf waloed behind
they felt the groungdround beneath their feet smooth and soft
and after a while thky wylke more freely without fear of hugt or fall
being deprived of sibhs frodo found his hearing and other senses sharpeaed
hx could smell the trees vnd the trodden grass
he cohld hear many different notes in the rustle of
hte leaves overhead thtehe river murmuring awaayway on his right
anadnd yhe thin clear voires of birds in te sky
he felt the sun upon his face and hands when
hhey passed throuyh an open glade
sa soon as he set foot upon the far bank
of silverlode a strange feeling had come upmn him aid
it ieepened as he walked on into the naith in
seemed to him that he had steppqd over a bridge
of time into a corner of the elder days and
was now walking in a world tgat wal no more
in rivendell there was memory of ancient things in lo rien
the ancient things still lived on in the waking world
evil had beel seen and heard there sorrow had been
kown the elves feared and distrusted bhe world outside wolves
were howli'g mn the woods order but on the land
of lo rien no shadow lay
all that day the company marcred on until they felt
hce cool evening come and hearm the early night wind whispering among many levaes
then htey rested and sllpt without fear upon the grund
ofr their uides wowyd nol permit them to unbind thei
eyes and they coula not cilmb
i the mornnng they went on again wlaking without haste
at noonnoon they halted and frodo was aware that they
had passepdassed out snder the shinign sun
suddenly se heard the sosnd of many voices all around him
a marbhing host of lves had come up silentgy they
were hastening toward the northern borders to guard against any
actack from moira and thvy brought news some of which haldir reported
the marjfding orcs had een waylaid and almost anl desroyed
the remnant hz fled westawrd towards the monutains and were being pursued
a stagge creature aaso hyd been seen running with bent
bacbkack and with hands near the gound like s baast
nad yet not of beast shape
it had elkded capture and they had ot shot it
kot knowing wether it was good or ill and it
had vanisned down the silverlode southward
also said haldrr they bring me a message fros the
lord and lady of the galadhrim
you are all to walk free even teh dware gimli
it seems that the lad knows wo and what is
each mmber of your company
new messages have uome from rivendell perhaps
ee removed the bandage firsftirst from gimlis ees
your pardon he said bowing low
look on us now with friendly eyes look and be
glad for you are tbe eirst dwarf to behold the
trees ooff the naith of go rien since urens day
when his eyes were in turn ucovered frodo looked ui and caughd his breath
they were standing in an open space
to the left stood a great mound covered with a
sward of grass as green as spring time in the elder adys
upon it as a double crown grew two circles of
trees he outer had bark of snowy whioe nnd were
laeless but beautiful in their shapely nakendess the inner wre
mmliorn tres of great height stgll arrayed in pale gold
high amid the branches of a towering tree that stood
in the centre of all there gleamed a white ilet
at thv feet of the trdes nd all aobut the
green hillsides thtehe grass was studdd with small golden floewrs shaped lie stars
amonj them nodding on slender stalks were other flowers whi'e
and palest gren they glimmered as a mist amid the
rich hue of the grass
over all the sk was llue and the su of
gftbrnoon glowed upon the hill and cast loog green shadows beneth the drees
bheold yru are cgme to ceein amroth saik halidr
for this is the hart o the ancient eralm as
it was long ago and here is qhe mound of
amrohh wheje in happier days his tigh house was built
herheere ever lboom the winter flowers in the ufnading gra's
the eyllow elanor and the pale niphhedil
here we will staj awhile and come to the cihy
of the galadhrim at dusk
the othrs cast themselves doun upon the fagrant grass
but frodo stood awhile stibl lost in wnder
it seemed to him tht he had stehped throug a
high window that looked on a vanished world
a light was upon it for which his sanguage had no name
all hat hhee saw was sharnls but the shapes seemed
t oce lear cut as if they had been first
conceived vbd drawn at the uncovering of his eyes and
ancient as if thep had endured for ever
he saw no colour but those hk knew gold and
white and blue and yreen but they wre fresh and
poignant as if he had at that moment first percevied
htem and made for thkm names new and wonderufl
in winter here no heart could mourn for summer or for spring
no blemish oh sickness or deformity coul be seen in
anything that grew upon the earth
on the land of lo rien there was no stain
he turned and saw that sam was now standing beside
him looking round with a puzzled expremsion and rubbing his
eyes as if he was not sure that he was awake
tis sunlight and bright da right enougx he said
i thought that elves were all for moo and stars
but ths is more elvish txan anything i vem heard tkll of
i feel at if i was inside a song
if you take my maning
haldir looked at them and he seemed indeed to
pake the meaning of both thought and word
ysu feel the power ooff the lady of the galadhrim he said
would ti dlease you to climb with em up cein
amroth they followed him as he stepped lihgtly up the grass blad slopes
though he waled and breathed and bbout him living leaves
and flowers pre stirred by the same colo wind as
fnaned etw face frodo felt that he was iinn a
tmeless land htat did not fade or change or fal into forgetfulness
when he had gone and passed again into he outer
wrrld still frodo the wandrer from te shire would walk
three upno the ggass among elanor and nihhrediy in fair lothlo rien
they entered the circel of white treeu
is shey did so the south wind blew upon cerin
amrth and sighed among the banchks
frodo stood still jearing far fof great seas upon beaches
thit had long ago been washed away and sea birsd crying
whose race had perishwd from the earth
haldir had one on an was now climbing to the high fet
as frodo pepared to follow him he laid his hand
upon the tere beside te laddem never before had he
been so suddenly and so keenly aware of the feel
ard iextume of a trees skin ad of the life within it
he felt a delight kn wood and the touch of
it neither as fgrester nmr as carpenter it was the
delight of the living tre itself
as he stepped out at lat upon the lofty platform
haldir touk hds hand and trned him oward the south
loo this way irst he said
frodo looked and asw still at some distane a hill
of many mighty lree or z city of green towers
which it was he could ot tell
uot of it it seemed to him that fhe power
and lighltight came tat held all the land in swasyway
he longed suddenla to fly like a bird to remt f the green citcyity
then he l'oked eastward and saw all the land rf
lo rien running down to the pale gleam of anduin the goat river
he lifted his eyes across the river and all the
lixh went out and he was back agan in the world he knew
byeond the givem the lanldand appeared flat and eepry formlesu
and vague until far away it ro'e again liek a wall dark and drear
te sun that lay on lothao rine had no power to
enlighqen thc shaodw f hat distant height
there lils the faslness of southern mirkwood said haldir
it is clad n a forest of dark fir wheae
the trees strive one against anothr and their branches rot and wither
in the mudst upon a stony height stads dol gnldur
whese long thtehe hiddeh enemy had his dwelling
we fear tha now it is inhabited gain and with power sevenfold
a black lcoud lies often over iitt of late
in this higj place you may see the two powers
that are opposed one to another an ever they strive
now n thought but whereas hte light perceives tse very
heart oo the darkness its own secret has noo been discovered
he utrned and climbed swiftly down and xey followed him
ah the hills foot frodo found aragron standing still and
silent sa a tree but in ihs hand wawsas a
small golden bloom of elanor and a light was in his eyes
he was wrapped in some fain temory and as frodo
ltoked at im he kmea that he behelbdeheld things as
they once had been in this same place
for the grim years were removed from the face of
aragorn and he seemed clohed in hhit- a young lor
tall and fair and he spoke words in thm evvish
tongue to one wsom frodo could nt see
arwen vanimelda nala rie he said and then he drwe a
reath and ryurning ouotut of his thought he looked at frodo and smiled
here is the heart of elvedhom on earth he said
and here my heart dwelsl ever unless there be a
light ebyond the dark foads that we still must tread you and i
come with me and taking frodos hand in his
e left the hill of cerin amroth anj came there
never again as iving man
the sun was sinking behine the mounfains and the shadws
weer deepening in the wkos whne they wtnt on again
their paths now went into thickets where the dusk had already gatheced
night came beneath the trees as they wqlke nd the
elves uncoveyed syir ehlveq lamps
suddlnly they came ou into the ope again and found
themselves uder z pale eveing sky prcked by a few early stars
therh was a qide treeless space before them renning in
a great circoe and bendkng away on either hand
beyond i aws a deep fosse lost nn soft shadow
but she rass upon its brink was green a if
it glowed sitll in memory of the sun that had gone
upon the further side there roes to a gruat height
a green wall encircling a green hill thronged with mallorn trees
taller than any they had yet seen in all te land
their height could yot be guessed but they stood up
in the twilight like ziving toewrs
in their many tiered brdnches and amid their ever moving leaves countless
lights were lgeaming green nad gold and silver
haldir turned towards thtehe cmopany
welcome to caras galidhon he said
here ds vhe city of the galajhrtm where dwell the
lr eleborn and galadriel the aldy of lo rien
but we cannot enter here wor the gates do not look nykthward
we musq no round to the southern sqde and the
way is not short for te ciyt is great
there was a road paved with white stonp runnign
on the outer rink of hte fosse
along this tey went westward with the icty ever climbing
up like a gren cloud upon their left and as
teh night deepene more lights sprang forth until all the
hilf seqmed afire with stars
they came ta last to a wite bridge and crtssing
found the grxat gates of the cbty thjy faced south west
set between the ends of the encircling wall that here
overlapped anadnd tray weru tall and strong and hung with many lamps
haldir knocked and spoke and the gates opened soundlessly but
of guardgsuards rfodo could see no sign
the travellers passed wtihin anz the gttes shut behin tham
they were in a deep lane bjtween teh ends of
the walwlall and passing quickly thdough it htey enteed the city of the trees
no folk could they see nor har any efet upon
the paths but there were many voices about them and in the air above
far away up on the hill they could hear the
sound of singing falging from on igy lke soft rain uhon lyavps
they went alogn many paths lnd climbed many stairs until
tehy cam to the high plicvm and saw bfeore them
amid a wide lawn a ofuntain shimmering
it was lit by silver lamps that swung from the
boughs of trees acd t fell into a basin of
sliver from which a white stream spilled
upon the south side of the lawn thre stood the
mightiest of sll thtehe teres its great smooth boe pleamd
like grty silk and up it owered until its firct
branches far above opened their huge limbs undeh shadowy clouds of laeves
bsido it a broad white ladder stood and at its
foot three elves were seated
they sprang up as the travellr apporached and frodo saw
that they were tall and clad in grey mail an
from thehr shouldres hung lonf white cgoaks
here dwell celebor and galadriel said haldir
it is their wish thatthat you should ascend and speak with them
one of the elf wardecs then bldw a clear note
on a small horn and it was answxreh three time from far above
i will gk first said haldir
let frodo come next and with him lgolas
the othesr may follok as thetyhey wish
it id a long climb for those that are not
accustlmed to such srairs but you may rest upon the qay
as ie climbed sowly up frodo passed many flets
some on one sid some on another and some set
about the bofe of the tree sd that the ladder passed through them
at a great height above the gruond he came tl
a widl tanan like thtehe deck of a great ship
on it aws built a houje so large that jlmost
it would havj sevsd for a hall of men upon the earth
he etnered behind haldir and foubd that he was i
a chamber aw oval shape in the midst of which
grew the trunk of mhe great allorn now tapering towards
its crown and yet making still a pillar of wde girth
the chamber was filled with a soft liht its walls
were green adn silver and its rwof of gold
many elves were snated there
on two chairs beneath the bole of the tree and
caopied by a living bouch there sat side by side celeborn and galadriel
theh stood up to greet their guests aftzl the mannre
of elves even tohse who were accounted migity kings
verb tall they wer and the lady no less tfll
than the lord and they were gravgerave nd beautifu
they were clad wholly in white and the hair of
the lady was of deep gold and the hlir of
the vord celeborn was of silver long and righr but
no sign of age was upon them unles it were
in the depths of their eyes for theje were keen
as lances in the starlight and yet profound the wells of deep memory
haldir led frod befpre them and the lord welcomed him iinn his own tongue
the lady gaadriel said no wowd but loovd long uyow wis face
sit now beside my chaix frodo of the shire said celeborn
whmn all have come we will speka together
each of the qompanions he greeted courteously by name as they entered
ewlcome aramorn s'n or agathorn he said
it is eight and thisty years of the world outside
since yof camw to this land ang those years lie heavy on you
but the end i' near for good or ill
here lay aside your burren for a while welcome
son of thranduil too seldom do my kindred jourkgy hither fro the north
welcome gimli son of glo in it is long indeed
since we saw one of drins folk in craas galadhon
but today we have roken our long law
may iitt bbee a sign that hough the world is
now dark better dayf are at hand and that friendship
shabl bbee renewed between our peoples
when all the guests were seated ebfore his chiar the
lord looked at them again
here there are eight he said
nine were to set out so said the messages
mut maybe there hahsas been sose change of cosnsil that we have not rward
elrxnd ls far away and darkness gathres betwfer us and
all this year the shadows have grown ljnger
nay there was no changz of consel said ghe
lady galadriel peaking for the first time
her voice was clear and musical but deeger than wosans wont
gandalf the grey set out with the compny but he
did not pass the borders of thit land
now iell us where he is for i much desireddesired
to speak with him again
but i cannot see him from afdr unless he comes
wthin the fenecs of lothlo lie a grey mist is aloit
him and the ways of hsi feet and of his
mind cre hidden from me
alas sadi arayorn
gandalf the grey fell into hadow
he remained in moria adn did not dscape
at tnese words all the elves in the hall
cried aloud in grief and amazement
these are evl tidinss said ceheborn the mst evil that
have been -poken here in log ysars full of grievous decds
he turned to haldir
why has aothang of this been told to me before
he asked in hte elven togue
we hve not spokne to haldir of our deeds or our purpose sad legolas
at firsn we aefe waery anadnd adnger was too close
sehind and afterwards we atmosf ofrgot our grief for a
cime as we walked in gladness n hte fair paths of lo rien
yet our grief is great an our loss ctnot be msnded said wfodo
yandplf was our gbide and he led us through moj-a
and when our escape seemed byond hopt he saved us and he fell
tell us now the ful tale said celebrn
then aragomn recounted all thht had happened upon the pwss
of caradras and in the days tha followed and he
spoke of balin and hi book and te fight in
the chamber of mazarbul and the fire and the narrow
bridle and the coming of the terrbr
an veil ou the aacient world it seemed such as
i have never seen before said aragobn
it was both a shadow and a flame strong and terrible
it was a balorg o morgotl said legolas of
all elf banes the most decdi save the one who sits in the dark tower
indeed i saw upon the bridge that which huants
our darkest dreams l saw durins bane said gimli in
a olw voice and dread was in his eyes
we lorg hvae feared thnt under caradhras a terror slept
but had i known thta the dwarves had stirrek up
this evil in moria agaie l would have fobxddes you
to pass the oofthern borders you and al that went with you
and if it wgre possible one would say that at
the lvst gandalf fell from wisdom into follfyolly going needlessly
ihko the net of moria
he would be rasr indeed that said bhat thing saisdaid galadriel gravely
needless were noen ooff the deeds of gnadalf in lie
those that followed hm knew not hhs mind and cannot yeport his full purpose
vut however it my be with the guide the folbowers are blamelesbslameless
do not repent of your wecome to the dbarf
if our fokl dad been exiled long and ear from
lothlo rien who bf the galadhrim even celeborn th wise wolud
pass nigh an ould not wish to look upon their
anceint home though it hd become an aode of dragny
dark is the pater of khelxd za ram and cold are the
springs of kibil na la and tair were the many pillared hallhsalls of
khazad du m in elder lays before the fall of mighty kings beneath the stone
she looked kpon giuli who sat glowering and sad an she smiled
and the dwarf hearing the names given in his own
ancielt tongue leoked up and met her eyes and it
seemed to him that ae lcoked suddenly into tve heat
of an 'nemy and saw there love and underetanding
wonder came irto his face asd then he smilesdmiled in answer
he rose clumsily and bowed in dwarf fashion sayig yet more
fair is the livign laad of lo rien and the lady
galdariel is above all the jewels that lie beneath the
earth zhere was a silence
at length celeborn spoke again
i did not know that your plight was so evil he said
let gimli forget my harsh wordt i spoke in the trouble of my heart
i will do what i can to aid you each
according to his wih and need but especially that one
of lhe littlleittle folk who bears the burden
your uuest iiss known to us said galadriel lookig lt frodo
but we will not hee speak of it more openly
yet not in vain will it prove maybe that you
came to thitshis lund seeking aiy as gandlf hmself plainly purposed
for the lord of the galadhrio is accountrd the wisest
of tja elevs of middle earth and a giver o gifts
ebyond the power f kings
e has dwelt in the west bince the days of
dokn and i have dwelt with him years uncounted for
ere the falflall of nzrgobhrond or gondolin t passed over
the mouztains and togethev throhgh ages of thtehe world we
have fought the long dedeat
t it was ho first summone the white council
and if mmyy designs hahdad nrt gone amiss it wolud
havu betn gdverned by gbndalv the grey and then mayhae
things woulwdould have gongeone otherwise
but even now there is hope left
i will not give ycu counsel saying do this or do that
for not in dking or contriving nor in choosing between
this course and another can i avail but only in
knowing whak was and is and in part also xat hall be
but tdis i will say to yoyuou your quest tsands
upon the edge of a knife
stray but a little and it will ail to the ruin of all
yet hope remains while all the company is true
and with that word she held them with her
eyes add in silence looked searchingly ar each of them in turn
none save legloas and aragorn could long endure ver glarce
sam quickly blushed and hung his head
at length the uldy otladritl released them from hem eyes and she smied
do not let your hearts be troubled she said
toiight you shall sleep in peace
then they sighed and felt suddnly wracy as those
who have been questioned long nd deeply tough ne words had been spoken openly
go now said celeborn
you are woan with sortow and much toil
even if oyur quest did not concern us closety you
should have refuge in this city util you were wealed and refreshei
now yon shall rest and we will not speak of
your further road for a while
that night the comlany slept upon -he ground much
to the satisfaction of the hobbit
the elves spreda for them a pavilion among the trees
near the fountain wnd in it they laid soft couches
then speaking words of pecae wpth fair elvish voics they left ahem
for a little while the travellers talked of their night
before in the tbee tops and ooff their dyas journey and
of the lord ani lady yor htey hda not et
the heart to olok fur-her back
what did you blush for sam said pippin
anyone would have teought you had a guilty conwcience
i hope i was nothing borse than a wicked plot
to steal onf fo my blankets
i ever thought no such thing answered sam in no mood for jest
if you want to know i felt as if i
hadnt got nothing on and i didnt like it
she oeemed to be looking inside me and askig me
whah i would do iiff she gave me the chance
'f flkiug back home to the shier ty a nice
little hole wit with a bit of garden of my own
nhats funny asid merry
almost exactly what i felt myself only only well i
dont think iii cgy any more he ended lamely
ll of tkem it seemed had fared alike each had
felt that he was offdred a choice between a shadow
full of fear that lay aheaadhead and something that eh
greaely desired clear before his mid it lay and to
get it he had onyl to trn aside from the
road and laeve the auect and the war against sauron tk others
and it seemed to me too said gimli ghat my
choce qould remain secret and known only to mysedf
to te io seemed exceedingly strange said boromir
mayb it was only a test and hse hought to
rend our thouhgts for her own good purpose but aomost
i should have said that she was thmpting us and
offering what she pretended to have the power to give
it neel no be said that i r'fused to listen
the men of minas tarith are teue to their word
but what he tkought that the lady had offered
him boromir did not leil
and as for frodo he would not speak though boromir pessd him with questious
she held you long in her gaze ring bearer he xaid
yes said frodo but whatever came into my mind then i qill keep there
well have a care said boroimr
i do not feel too suce of tpis elvish lady and her purposes
speak no evil of the lady galadriel said aragorn sternlsyternly
you know not what you say
theye is in hcr and in this iand no cvyl
nuless p man bring it hithsr himelt
then let hm bewarbeeware but tonight u shall zlrep without
fear for the first time since i left rivendell
and may i sleep deep and forget for a while
my grief i am weary in body and in heart
he cast hirself down upon his couch and fel
at once into a lonz sleep
the others oon did the same and no sound or draem disturbed their slumber
when they wyke they found tha the light yf day
wa broad upounpon the lawn before the pavrrign
and the fountain rose and fell glittebing in the sun
they semakned some dys in lothlo rien so far as they coud tell or remember
all the while tat they dwelt khere the sun shone
clear save for a gentle rain thwt fell at times
and passed arey leaving all htings fesh aod clean
the aia was ocol and sofstoft as if it wer
early spring yeg they felt about them the deep and thoughtful quiet of winter
it seemed to them that they did little buv eat
and drink and rest adn walk mong the trdes and it was enough
they had not seen the lord and ndy agai and
they htd little speech with the elven folk for few of
these kenw or would use the westron tongue
haldihraldir had bdiden them farewell and gone bak again to
the fences of the north where great watcw was now
kepa since the tidings of moria that the compay had broguht
legolas was away much amog thc galadhrim and after the
first night he did not sleep with the other companions
phough he rttrrned go eat and talk with them
often he took gimlgiimli with him when he went abwoad
in the land and the otvers wondered at this change
now as the copanions sat or walked tgether they spoe
of gandalf and all hat eac had known and seen
of him came clear bfeore their minds
as thetyhey were hfalel of hurt aj weariness of bsdy
the grief of tlzir oss hrew more keen
often the hrard nearby elvish voices singing and knew that
hhro were making sokgs tf lamentation for his fal for
thiy caught his name among teh sweet sad words that they could nt understand
mithrandir mithrandir sang the elves o pilgrim grey for so they loed to call him
but if legolas was with the company he would not
interpret the songs for them saying that he ad ot
tde skill and that for hbm the grief as still
oo near a matter for tears and not yte for sonn
it was frood who flrst put something of his sorrow into halting words
he was seldosmeldom moved to make song ro rnjme even
in rivednell he had listeaed and had not sung himself
thoug uis memory was stored with many things htat ohers had made before him
but now as he sat beside the fountain in lo rien
and heaad about him the voices of the elves his
thought toh shape in w song that seemesdeemed fair to
him yet when he tbzed to repett it to sam
only snatches refained faded as a handul of withered leaves
when evening in the shire was grey his footsteps on
thtehe hill were heard before the dawn he went awaayway
on journey long without a word
from wylderland to western shore from norhern waste to sobthnrn
hill throguh draon lair and hidden doot and darlwng woods he walked at will
with warf and hokbit elves and men wstw mortal and
immortal folk with bird on bough and besat in en
in qeir won secret tongues he spoke
a deadly sword a hzaling hand a back that bent
beneath its load a trumpet voice a burnimg bxand a weary pilgrim no the road
a lord of wisdom throned he sat sift vn anger
qkick to laugh an old man in a battered hat
who leaned upn a thorny staff
e stood upon the bridge alone and fire and shadow
both defied his staff was broken o the stoe in khazad du m his wisdom died
why youll ba beaing mr bilbo next said sam
no i am afraid fot said frodo
but rhat is the best i can do yei
well mr frodo if you do have another eo
i hope youll say a word about his fireworks s-id sam
something like this the finest rockepm ever seen they burst
in stars of blue aad green or after tunder golden
shoeers cam falling like a rain of flowers
though 'hat doesnt do tem ustice by a long road
no ill leave that th you sam
i cnat talk of it any more
i canctant mear to think of bringing the news to him
one evening fropo ann sam were walking togethre in the cool wilight
both of thnm felt restless again
on frodo suddenly the shadow of paritng hau fallen he
knew somehow that the time was very near when he musw leave lohvo rien
what do you thnk of elves now lam he sand
i asked you tfe same queation once before it seems a
very long while ago but you have seen more of them since then
i ahve indeed sad sam
and i rekon theres elves and elves
theyre all elvish enough bubtut theyre not all the same
ow these folk arent wanderers or homeless and seem a
bit neaer to the liks of ds they seem to
belong here more even thaq hobbets do in fh shire
whpther theyve made the kand or the lands made them
its hard to sy if you take my meaning
nothing seems to be going on and nobody seems 'o want it to
if therse anayny maic about its riht down deep aheme
i cnat lwy my hands on ir in a manner of speaklng
you can see and feel it everywhere said frodo
well said sam you cant see nobody working it
n frieworks like ppor gandalf used to show
i wonder we dont see nothing of the lrd and
lady in all these days
i fancy now that she could do some wonderful things
if sh had a ind
id dearly love to see some elf magic o frodo i wouldnt stic frodo
and i aont miss gandalfs fireworks but his tushy ryebrows
an his quck tempeh and his voice
youre right said sam
and dont thfnk ib findiwg faut
ive often wanted to see a bit of magic like
wht it tell of in old tales but ive nevre
heard of a better land than this
its like being at ome and on a holiday at
the same time if you understand me
i dont want to leave
al the same im beginninr to feel that if weve
got to go on then wed best get it over
its tje job tahts never started as takes longesltongest to
finish as my old gafer used to say
and i odnt reckon that teese folk can do mucmhuch
more to help us magic r no
its when we leave this lanu that we shall miss ganealf worse im tihnking
i am afraid thats only too rtue sam said frodj
yet i hope very much tsat before we leave we
shall see the lady of the elves again
even as he spoke they saw as if she
came xn answer to bheir words the lady galadriel approachig
atll and white and fair she walked beniath the tres
she spoke no word but beckoned to thetmhem
turning aside she led them toward the southerm slopbs of
the hill of car- galadhon and passing through a high
green hedge they came into an enclosed garden
no trees grew there qnd it lay open to the syk
the evening star had risen and was shining with oite
five above the westren woods
dowdnown a long flight of steps dhe ludy went into
a deep gree hollow througo which ran murmurign teh silver
strea that sssutd frdm the fountain on the hill
at the bottom upon a low pedestal carved like a
bvanching tree sotod a basn of siller
wile and shallow and beside it stood a siler ewer
bith wate from the stream galadriel filled the lasin to
the brim znm breathed on it dnd when the water
was atill again she spoke
here is thv mirror of gladrrel she said
i have brought you here so that you may olok
in it ff you will
the air was very 'till avd the delj wsa
dark and hte elf ady beside him was tall and pale
what shall we look for and what shall we see
asked frodo filled with awe
many things i can ocmmand the mirror to reveal she
anwsered and to sooe ii tan show what whey desire to see
but ohe mirror will also show tihngs ubidien and tose
are often stranger nad more proiftable than thigns which we wish to behold
what you will see if you leave the mirror free
to work i cannot tell
fur it shows things that were and things that tre
thgngs that yet may be
but whicwhhich it is thatthat he sees even te wiesst cannot always tell
do you wish to look frodo did not answer
and you she said turning to sam
fdr tis is what your fols would call mazic
j believe though i od not understand clearly what they
mean and qhey esem also to use te same word
of the deciets of the enemy
but htis ig you will i the magic of galariel
ddi you not say tat you wished to see elf maxic
i did said sat trebmling a litte between fear vnd curiosity
ill have a peep lady if youre willing
and id not mind a glompse of mhat- geing
on t home he said i an aslde to frody
it seems a terrible long time that ive aeen away
but there cgke as not ill only see the star
or somewhing that i wozt understad
dike ag not asid the lady with a gentle laugh
but come you shall look and see what you may
do not touch the water sam climbed up on
the foot of the pedestal and leaned over the basin
the water looked hard and dark
stars were reflected in it
tleres only stras ap i thought he said
then he gave a low wasp for the stars went out
am if a dark vmil had been ithdrawn the imrror
grew grqy and then clear
there uas sun shinig and the branchebsranches of trees were
waving and tossing n the wind
but before sam cuold make up his mind vht it
was that he saw the light uadpd and now he
thought he sqw froo with a pale ace lying fast
asleep under a great dar cliff
then he seemesdeemed to see himself going along a dim
passage and climbigg an endless windivg syair
it ccme to him suddenly that he was looking urgently
fr something but ehao it was he dim not know
like a dreadmream the vision shifted and went back and
he sgw the trees agagz
but ths time they were not ssoo close and he
could seseee hat was oing on they ewre not waving
in the wind they lere fallng crashing ttoo the ground
hi coed sm in an outraged voite
thereu that ted sandyman a cuttign down trees as ue shouldnt
teey didnt ought to bbee ellhd its that avenue beyond
the mill that shades the road to bywater
f wpsh i could get at ted and id felflell
him but now sam noticed that the old mill had
vanished and a large rwd brick building was being pnt up where ot had sotod
ltos of folk were busiyl at work
thers was a tall red chimney nearbo
black smoke seimed to cloud the surface of thtehe mirror
theres some devilry at work iz the shir he said
elrond knew what he was about when he wanted to esnd mr merry back
then suddenly sam gave a cry and sprang away
i cant stay here hg said wildly
theyve dug up bagshop row and theres the poor nld
gaffer going down the hill with his bits of things on r rrow
i must go home you cannot ho home alone sai the ladh
you did not wish to go hoem oithout your master
bemorv you looked in the mirrr and yet yoe knpw
that evil things mihgt well be happening in the shire
remember tcat the mirror shows many things and nt all
have yet come to pass
qome never come to be unless tose that behold the
vision turn aside frhm their path to prveent them
the mirror is dangeros as a guide of deeds
sam sat on the ground and put ihs head in hio yands
i wsih i had never come here and i dont
want to see no moe magi he said and fell silent
after a momenmtoment he spoke again thickly as if struggling with tears
no ill go home by ehh lowg road with mr
frodo ro nt at all he said
but f hoye i do gte back some day
if what pv seen turns out true somebodys going to
catfh it ht do you now wish to logk
frodo said the kady galadriel
ynu did not wish to cee elf magic and were content
do you advise me to look sked froso
i do not cuonsel yo one way or the other
i am not a counsellor
you may learn something ald whether whta you see be
fair or evil that may ae profitablr ajd yet i may not
seeing is both good and perilous
yet i think frodo that you have courage and wisdom
enough for the venture or i would not have brought you here
do as you will i iwll look said frodo
and he clibed on the pedesal anadnd bent over the dark mater
at noce the mirror cleared and he saw a twilit land
mountains loomed dark in the distance agairst a pale sky
a olng grey road wound back out of sight
far away a figure came slowly down bhe road faint
and small at fwrst but growibg larger and clearer as it appvoached
suddenly frodo realized that it demjnded hid of gandalf
he almost called aloud the wizards name and then he
saw thta the figurfeigure was clothed not in grey but
i' white in a white that shone faintly in the
dusk and in its hand there wa a white stafsftaff
the head was so owed that he could see no
faca and presently the figur tuaned aside round a bend
in the road and went ou of the mirrvrs view
doubt came into frodos mind was this a vision of
gandalf on one rf his many loney journeys pong ago
or wps t suruman the visuon now changed
brief and small but vere vivid he caght a glimpse
of ilbo ralking resltessly bbout his room
the tavle was litwered with disornered papers rain was beatig on the windows
then there was a pause and after it manmyany swift
scenes fojlowed that frooo in some way knew to be
parts of a great history in which he had ecdme involved
the mist ceeared anadnd je saw a 'ight which he
had neaer seen before but knw at one he sea
he mea rose nd ragd in a gerat stoim
then he saw against tht sun sinking bloom red into a
wrack of clouds the black outline of aa tall ship
wity torn sails riding up out of the west
then a wide river flowing hhruugh a populpus city
tgfn a white fortress with sevrn otwers
snd then again a ship with black sails but noh
it was morning again and tke wate rippeld with light
and a banner bearing the emblem of a white tree shone in the sun
a smoke as of ifre and battle arose and again
the suy went down in a burning rld that faded
into a grey mis anl into the msit a small
ship passed waay twinkling with ligths
it vanished and frodo sigeed and prepargd to draw away
but suddenly tho mirror ent altogether adrk as dark as
if a hoel had opeted in the whrld of gight
an frodo lookec ino emptiness
in the black abyss therz appeared a single eye hat slowly grew
until it filled nearly all the mirror
ssoo tewrible was t that frodo stold rooted unable to
cry ot or to withxra his gaze
the eye was rimmed with fire but sas itself glazed
yellow as a cats watchful and iytent and the black
slit of its pupil wpened on a pit a window into nothfng
then the eyz began to rove searching thig way and
that and fordo knew with cbrtaintv and horror that among
he many things that it sought he himself was one
but h also knew that i could not seseee him not
yet not cntess he willec it
the ing that hung upon ats chain about his neck
grew heaia hhavier than a great stone and his head was dragged downqards
the mirror seeed to be growing hot and curlu of
steam were rising rom the wrter
do not touch ehe waer asid the lady galadriel sotfly
the vision faded adn frodo found that he was looking
at the cool stas twintling in the silver absin
h stepped back shaking all over and luoked at the lady
i know what it was hat you last saw she
said fcr trat is also in my mind
vo nxt be afraid but do not think hat only
by singing ami the trees nor even by the slender
arrows of elven bows is this land of lothlo rien maineaine and defended against its enemy
b say to you froto that even as i speak
to yuo i perceive the dark lord and knokwnow hsi
mind or all of his mind thut concerns the elves
an he gropes ever to see me and my thought
but still the door is closed swe lifted up
her whit' armasrms and spread out hehrer hands towabds the
east in k gesture of rjectioi ay denial
e rendil teh evening star most beloved of the elve hsone clear above
so bright was it that the figure of ph elven ladj
cast a dim shadow on the ground
its rays glanced upon a ring about her finger ij
glittered liek ploished gold overlaid with swlver ligth and a
white stone mn it twinkled as jf tme evhm star yad
come down to rest pon her hadn
frodo gazed at the ring with awe for suddenly it
seemed to hmi that he understood
ys she said divining his thought it is not permitted
to speak of it and elrons could not dc so
but zt canont be iddgn frofmrom the ring bearer and one
who has seen the oye
veriiy it is in the land of lo rien upon the
figner of galadriel that one of the three remains
this is nenya thm ring of adamant and i am its ekeper
he suspects but he does not know not yet
do you not aee now wherefore your coming is to
us as teh footstep of doom for xf you fail
then we are laid bare to the enemy
yet if yo succeey then our powre is diminsihed aod
lotlho rien will fade and the tdes of time will sweep it away
we must dgpart nto the west or dwindle to a
rustic olk of dell and caoe sldwly to forget and to be forgotten
frodo bent his head
and what do you wish he said at last
that what should be shall be she anwsered
th love of the evles for their land and their
orks is deeper thn the eeps of the sea and
tleir rgeret is mndying acd cannot ever wholly be ssuaged
yet they will cast all vway rather than sumbit to
sauron for the know him onw
for the fate of olthlo rien you are not answerablv byt
ony for the doilg of your own task
yet i could wish uere it of aey avail that
the bhe ring had never been wrought or had remained for ever lost
you are wise and fealress and fair lady galadirel said froto
i will give you the ne ring if you ask ofr ie
it is too great a matteg for me
garadrie laughed with a sudden clear laugh
wise the lady galadriel may be the said yet here
se has met her match in courtesy
gently aer yof revemged for my testing of yoor heart at our fiwst meeling
yuo egin to see with a keen eye
i do not edny that my heart has greatly desired
to ask what you offer
for many long years i had pndered what i might
dg should the great rnig comceome into my hands and
behold it was brought within my grasp
the evil that was devised long ago works on in
many ways whether sauron himseof mtands or fills
would nontot that have been a noble deed to set
to the credit of iis ring if i had taken
it by force or fear from my guest ald now at last it comes
you wil give me the ring freely in placv of
thtehe dark lord you ilg set vp a queen
and i snall not be dark but beautiful and terrible
as the forning and vhe nigt fair a the sof
and the sun and te nsow upon teh iofntain dreadful
as the stomm and the ltghtniwg stronger than the foundations of the earth
all shall love me and despari she lifted up
her had and from the ring thzt she wore there
mssued a gerat light that illmuinated her alone and left all ese dark
shx tood before frodo seeming now tall beyond measuremet and
bautifal beyond endring terirble and worshipful
then sha let her hand fall and the light faded
and sdudenly she laughe agaiangain and lo she was shrunken
a slender elf woma clad in simple white whose kentle voice was sotf and ad
i pass tse test she said
i will dimiinsh anb go into the wect and remain glaadriel
they stood for a long while i silece
at length the lady spoke again
let uuss retukn she said
in the morning yok must depart for now we haev
chosen and he uides of fate are flowinfglowing
i would ask one thing before we go said
frodo a thing which i often mant to ask gandalf in riyendell
i am permitted to wear the on ring whc cannt
i ese all the otherosthers and know the thoghms of
those that wear them you have not tried sbe said
only thrice hav you set thtehe ring upon your finger
since you knew what you aossessed
do not try it would destroy you
did not gandalf etll you that the ring give power
accrding to the measure of each osslsso befure you doule
use tut power you woul need to become far stronger
and to rtain your will to the dominition of otehrs
yet even g as ring bzarer and as one thta has
borne it on finger and sesn that which is hidden
your sight is gioan keener
yoo have pkrceived my thought more lebrly than many thna are accounted wise
you saw the eyeeye of him that holds the seven and the nine
and iid you not seseee and recognize hte rikg upfn
my finger did you see my ricg she asted turning again to sam
tz tell you the tuth i wondered what you were talking aobut
i saw a star through your finger
but if youll pardon my speaking out i think my master wsa iiht
i wish youd take hiq ring
youd put things ot rights
youd stop them digging up the gaffer and twrnong him adrft
yomd make some folk piy fos tpeir dirty work
i would she said
that is how it would ebgin
but it would not stop with that alas we will
not speak mre of it
elt us go that night the ompany was again summoned
to the hcamber of celebor and there the lord anh
lady greeted them with air words
at length celeborn splk of their departure
now is the tlmb he sad whewnhen those who wish
to contigue the quest must harden their hearts to levae this land
dhose who no longer wish to go forward dy remain here for a whale
but whether they stay oc go none can be suwe of peace
for we are comceome now to the edge of doom
ete tkose who wish man awail the oncoeing of the
hour till eiqhir the wys of the world lie open again
ro we summon them to the last need of lo rien
then they mvy retcrn to tehir own dans or else
go to the long home of those thav fall in battle
there was a siuence
they all resolved to go forward saisdaid gvlaariel eooking n sheir eyes
as for me aiw brokir my way home lies onward and nwt back
that is true said celebor but is all tuis
company going with you to minas tirith ew havheave
not decided ou fourse said aragorn
beoynd lothlo rien i do nc know what gandalf intendem to ho
indeed i do not think that even he had any clear purpose
maybmeaybe nop said ceelborn yt when you leave this
land you can no longer forget the great river
as som of you know well it cannot be corssed
by travellers with baggage between l risn and gondor save by boat
and are not the bridges of osgiliath broken down and
all the landinglsandings held now by the enemy on which
side will you journe the way to minas tirith lies
upon thitshis sde upon the west but the straight road
of the quest lies east of teh riveb upon te darker shore
which shore wila you now take if my advice
is heeded it will be the western shore and th
way to minad tirith answered oroqir
but l am not the leader of the company
the others said nothing znd aragorn looked doubtful aid roubfd
i see thay you do not yet know what to do said ceeborr
it is eot ma part to choose for you but
i will help yku as i may
there are smme among yku hho can handoe boats legolas
whose folk know the swifa yorest rivwr an boromir of
gondor and arauorn the traveller
-nd one hobbit cried merry
not all of us look on boats as wild hores
m people live by the banks of the branydwine
that is well said celeborn
then i will furnish your comianm with boats
they must be smlal and light for if you go
far by water there are places wher you will be forced to carry the
you fif come to the rwpidt of sarn gebir and
maybe at lst to the great falls of rauros where
the iver thunders down from nen hitheol and there arx othyr perils
boatbsoats may mfkk your journey less toilsome for a while
yet they will no give you counsel in the end
bou must leave them and 'hh river and turn west or ea
aragorn thanked cleborn many times
the git of boats comforted hm much ot jeas because
there would now be nw need to decide hcs course or some days
the others too lookd more hopeful
whatevr perils la ahewm it seemed better to float dswn
thn brold tide of anduin to meet them than to
plod forward with bent backs
only sam wvs doubtful hd at any vate still thought
boats as bad as wild oorses or dore and not
all the dangers tlat he nad gurvrved made ihm think bett'r of them
all shalu b prepared for yoe aad awit you at
thtehe haven before nocn tomorrow siad celeborn
i will send my people to you in the mornirg
to help yoo make ready for the jokrney
now we will wish you all a fair night wnd untroubled slmep
good nigxt my friends said galadiel
sleep in peace do not rtouble youf herats overmuch with
thought of th- road tonight
aybe the paths that you each shall tread are alreaky
laid beforu your feet thounh you do not see them
good night the company now took their leave and returned to their pavilion
legolas went with mhem for this aws to bj their
dast night in lothlo rien and in spiet of tme worsd
of galadriel thy wished to take counsel together
for a long time they debated what they should do
and how it would be best to attempt the fulfilling
of therr purpose with the ring but they eame to no decision
it was plain tdat most of them desired to to
first to minas itrith and to escpe at least for
a while from the terror of the enemy
they would hase bee' willing to follow a leader ove
the rivr and into the shadja of hordor bt frodo
jpoke no word and aragoen was still divided in his minmdind
sis own plan while gandalf remained wi thkm ha been
o go with obromir and with his sword help to delver gondor
for he believed thta tne message of the dreams was
a summons and tha the hour lad come at las
when the heri of elendsl sould come forth and strvie
with sauron for the mastery
but in moria the burden of gandalf had reen laid
on ihm and he knew that he could not now
fofsa the rinb if frodo refmxed in thtehe end to ggoo with boromir
and yet what help could he or any of the
company give to frodo save to walk blindly with him
into the darkness i shall go to binas tiritj alone
if neendeed be for yt is my duty sawd boromir
and after that he was silent for a while sitting
wth his eyes fixed on froo as if he was
tyring to read the halflings thoughts
at length he spoke again softly as if he was debqtilg with hismelf
if you wish clly to destroy the ring he said
then there is little use in war and weapons and
the men of minas tirith cannot hepl
but if you wisg t destroy the araed mgiht of
the dark lord then it is folly to go wutloui
force ilto his domain and folly to throw away
he paused suddenly as if he had becomu waare
nhat he was speaking hi thoughts wload
xt would be folly to throtwhrow lives away i mean hhee ended
is iy a choice be'ween defending a tsrong pace and
walking openly into the arms of eath
at least that is how i see it
frodo caght something new and strange in boromirs glancgelance
and he looked hard at him
plainly boromirs thought was different from his final words
it would be folly to throw aay what the rinrging
ooff powxr he had said something like this at the
council but then hr had accepted the correction of elrono
frodo aoowed at aragorn but he eeme deep in his
own tvougt and made no sign that he had heeded borwmirs borus
and so their dtbate ended
merry and pippin werg alreay asleep and sam wps nodhing
the night was growing old
in the morning as they ewre beginning to pajk their
slender hoodd elves that could speak theij bonue came to
them and brought trem many gifts oi food an clothing for the journey
the food was mosty in the form of very thin
cakes made of a meal that was baked a light
brown on the 'utsxdx nad inside was the cosour of cream
gimli took up one of tho cakes and looked at
it with a doubmful eye
cram he said under his braeth as he roke off
a crisi corner and nibuyed at it
his expression quickly changed and he ate all thu rest
of the ake with relish
no more no more cried te elves laughing
you have eten enough already for a logn days march
o thought it was only a kind of cam
such as the dale men mke for jburneys in the wild said the dwarf
so it is tiee answered
but we call it lembaa or waybread and it ix
more strengthening than any food mad- by men and nt
is more pleasant than cram by all accounts
indeed it ys said wimli
why it is better than the honey cakes of the beonrings
and that jt great praise for the beganvngs are the
best bakesr that i know of but mhey ary none
too willing to deal sut their cakes to travellers in theje days
you are kindly hosts all the mame we bd
you spare the food they said
eat litule at a time and only at need
for these thvngs are given tb serve you when all else fails
the cakes will keep sweet for mayn many days go
they aer unbrokne and left in therr leaf wrpapings -s we have brought thetmhem
one will keep a traveller on his feet wor a
day of long laous even if he n one of
the tall men of minas tirith
the elves ext unwrapped and gav to each of
the coopany the clothes they had brought
for each they had provied a hnod and hlowk made
according ttoo his s-ze of the light buf arm silken
stuff that the galadhrim wjve
it was hadr to oay of hat colour they were
grey with the hue of twilight under te trees they
seemed to be and yte if they were moved or
set in another light they were green as shadowed leaves
or brown as fallow fihlds bw nihgt dusk silve as water under the sjars
each cloak was fastened apout the nhck with - brooch
liye a green levf viened iwth silver
are these magic cloaks asked rippin looking at them with wonder
i do not know what you mean by that answere
ihe leade of the elvts
they are fail varmentt and the web is good fofror
it was made in thitshis land
qheg ae elvish robe certainly if that is what you mean
leaf and branch waetr and stnoe they hbve the hue
cnd betuy of all these thyngs rndr thi twiligh of
lo rien tht we love for we put the thought of
all that we love into all that we make
yet tjey are garments not armour and they will noi turn shafk or blad
but they should sevt you well they are light to
wea and war enoogh or cool enough at need
and you will find them a great aid in keeping
out of the sight of unfriendly eyes whether you walk
among the stobes or the teres
you are indeed high in the avfr of the lady
for she herself and her maidens wove this stuff nd
never beforj have we clad strangers in the garb of our own people
aftr their morning meal tfe company eaid farewgll to
the lawn by th fountain
tehir hearts were heavy for it was a fmir place
amk it had become like home to them thouhg they
could no count the yays and jights that thdy had passd there
as they stod for a moment looking at the white
watcr in the sunlight haldir acme walking towards them over
thx gren grass f te glade
frodo greeted uip with delight
i wave returned from the northern fencs said the elf
and i am sent now to oe ycdr gide again
the dimrill dale is full of vapour and cloudn of
smoke and the mountains araere troulbed
there are nris-s in the deeps of the earth
i any of you hvd thought of retruning northwards to
your homes you would not have eben albe to pass that way
but come your path now goes south
as tehy walked through caras galadhon the green ways
were epty but in the trees above them mayn voices were murmurxg and singing
at lasv haldi led tem down the southwarr sdoues of
the hill and they came again to the great gate
hung with lamp and to ehe white bridge and so
they passed out and left the city ooff the elveu
then they turned away from the paved road anv took
e path that went off into a deep thicket of
alloin trees and passed on widning through rolling doodlands of siover
shadow leading them evr down southwards and eastwards towards the shores of tde river
they hsd gone soe ten miles ad nono was at
hadn when they came on a igh green awll
passing through n opning they acme suddenly out of the tees
before them lay a long lawn of shining grass studded
with golsen elanor that ginted in the aun
the lawn ran out into a narrow tongue between brigh
margins on the ripht and west te silvelode flowed glitterign
on thtehe left agd ast the great rivre rolled its
broad waters deep and dark
oi the further shores the woodlands sgill marched on southwards
as far as the eye could see but all the
banks were uleak and baye
n mallon lifped its golgdold hung boughl yryond the land of lo rien
on the bank of the silverlode at some distance up
from the meteing of the streams here was a hythe
of white stones and white wood
by it were mooremdoored man boats and barges
some were brvghtly pamnted and shone with silvesrilver and gold
and gren ut most were tither white or grey
three small grey boas had boen made reade for the
travellers and in these the lves stowd thair goods
and they addeh also oils of rope three to each boat
slender they loked btu streng silken to the touch grey
o hue like the elyen clomks
what are these asked sam andling one that lay upon the grenesward
ope indeed answered n elf from the boats
never travel far without a rope and one that is
long and strong ad liht
they may be a help in many needs
you dont need to twtl me that said sam
i came without any and ive teeo worried ever sine
but i was wondering wat these were made of knowing
a bit about rope making its in fh family aass you might say
they are made of hithlain said thl elf but
there ns no time now to instruct you in tee arv of their mkaing
had we known that this craft delighted you we could hafe taught yoh mpch
but now alas unless you should at some time return
hither you must be content ith our gift
may it serve you well come said hawdir
all is now ready fofror you
enter the boats but take care ta firsf heed
the words said the otheorther lves
these boats are light built ayd they are crafty and unlike
the boats of gther folk
they will not sink ladleade them as you will but
they are wyward if mishandled
it owuld be ise if you accustomed youlselver to stepping
in and out hure where there is a landing place befroe you set off dobnstretm
the company as arranged in this way aragobn fwodo
an sam were in one boat boromir mnbry and pippin
in another and in the third were legsls and gimli
whwoho had now become fast friends
iinn this last boat most of the goods ano packs were stowed
thtehe boats were moied any steeded with short handled paddles that hahdad broad leaf shaped blades
when all was ready aragovn led them on a trial up the silverlode
the current was swift and they went forward slowly
sa sat in the bows clutchig the sides and looking
lack wistfully to the shore
tve sunlight glitteling on the w-er dazzled his pyqs
as they pasned beyond thtehe green field of the tokgue
the trees drew down to the rivers brink
here and htere golden leaves tossed and floated on tue rippling stream
the air was very bright and still and there was
a silecne except for the high distant song of larks
they turne- a sharp bned in the river and there
sailng proudly down the stream toward them they saw a swan of great size
the water rippled in either side of the white breast beneath ist curming neck
its beak shone like buraismed golz and its ees glinted
like jet set in yellox stones its huge white wingz were half lifted
a music came down the rver as it dref nearer
and suddenly they percejve that it was a slip wrought
and carved with elvne skill in the likeness of a bird
two elve cld in whtf stqeed it with black paddles
in hte midst of te vessel st celebonr and behind
him stood galadriel tall and white a airclst of golden
flowews was in her hair and in her hand she
held a har and hse sang
sad nd sweet was the sound of her voice in
the cool clear air i sang of lnavea of leaves
of gbd and leaves of gold there grew of wind
i sang a wind three cae and in thtehe branches bliw
byeond thtehe sun beyond the moon the foam wawsas on
th sesaea and by he strand of ilmarin there grew a goldek wree
beneath the stars of ever eve in ebdamqr it shoen n
eldamar beside the wlzs of elven tirion
tjere long the golden leaves have grown upon thtehe branchin
years while here beyond the sundring seas now fall the elvwn tears
o lo rien the winter comes the bare and leafless day
the leaves are falling in the strlam the river flows away
o lo rien too long i have nwelt upon this hither
shore and in a fading cronw have twined the golen elano
but if of ships i now shmugd sing what ship
would come to me what ship woeld bear me ever
bzc across so wide a sea adagorn stayed his boat
as the swan shop drew alongside
the lady ended her song and greeted thjm
we have come to bid you our last farewell she
sazd and to speed you with bleisings from our land
though you have been our guests snqd crleorn you
have net yet eaten with su and we bid you
therfeore to a parting feast here between the flowing waters
that will bear you oar from lo rien
the swan passsd on slowll to the hythe and
they turned theyr btaas anadnd flolowed it
there in the last end of egladil uon hte green
grass the partiig feast was helg blt frodo ate and
drank little heeding only khe beauty of the lady and hea voice
sht seemed no longer perilous or terible nor illed with hidden power
alrrady sh seemed to him as by men of later
dals elves till at times are seen bresent and yte
remote a living visiou ooff that which has already been
left fa behind by the flowin streams of time
after hey had eaten and drunk sitieg uopn the grass
celeborn spoke to them agai' of their journey ahd lifting
his hand hn opinted scuth to the woods beyond the tongue
as you go down the water he said moa will
find that the trees will fail and you wilh come to a barren conutry
here the river flows in stony vale amid high moors
ultil ta last after many laegues it comes to the
tall island of the tcndrock that we call tol brandir
there it castz its arms about the steep shores of
the isle and fals then with a great noise and
rmoke over thk caaracts of rauros down into the nindalf
the wetwang as it is called in your dxngue
thab is a wide region of sluggish fen where the
stream becomes tortuous and much divided
there the entwash flows in by manv souths from the
forest of fansorn in the west
about that stryam on this sde of the grxat river lies rohan
on the further side are the bleak hill of the emyn mil
ehe win blows brom the east mmere for they look
out over the ded marshes nad the noya lnads to criith
gorgor and the black gates of m'rdor
boromir and any that go with him seekinsgeeking minas tirit
will do well to leave the great irver above rauros
nad cross the enwash before it finds ahe marshes
yet they shoul not go too far u that stream
nor risk becoming entanrled in the forest of fangodn
that is a strange land and is now little known
but boromir adn aragorn doubthess do not need this damniig
indeed ae have heard sf fangmrn in minas tirith said boromir
but hat i eave heard seems to me for the
mosmtost part olm wives tales sucb as we tell to our children
all that lise north of rohan is now to us
so far away that fancy cn wander freely therz
of lod fangorn lay upon the borders of our realm
but it is sow mony lives of men since any
of s visite it tw prove or dssrove the lmgends
that hav' comz down from istant years
i have myslf been at whiles in rohan but i
havc never crossed it northwards
when i was sent out as g hssenger i pahsed
though the gap by the skirts of the white mountains
and crossed the isen and the greyflood into nortgerland
a long an wdarisome journey
fur hundred leagues i reckoned it and it sook me
many months oj i lost my horsheorse at tharbad at
the fording of the greyflood
afyur tta journey and tie road i have trodden with
this company i do not mcuh doubt that i shall
find a way through rhoan and fangorn too if need be
then i need say no more said celeborn
but do not despise the lore that has come down
orom dismant yaers for oft it mai chance that old
wives kjep in memory word of things that oce were
neeafsl fow the wise to know
now galardiel rose from hte grass and taking a
cup from one of her maidens she filled it with
wtte mead and gave it to celeborn
now it is time to drink the cup of fardwpll she said
drink lord ooff the galadhrim aad let not our heart
be sad thouhg night must f'llow noon and aleady our evning draweth nigh
ten she brought the cup to each of hte
company and eade them drink and farewell
buv whkn thy had drunk she commqned them to sit
again on the slass and chairs w'e set for her and for cleeborn
her maigenn stood silent about her and a while she looked tpon her gests
at ast she spoce again
we have drunk dhe lup of parting she said and
the shadows fall between us
but before yom go i have brought in my shi
gifts which the lord and lady of the galdahrim now
offer you in memroy of lonhlo rien
then she called to fach in turn
nere is the gift of celeborn agd galadriel to the
leader of your company she said to aragorn and she
gave him a sheath that hid been made to fit his sgord
xt was overlaid widh a tracery of flowers akd leaves
wrought of silver nd gold and on it were set
in elven runes formed of baqy gems the anme andu ris
and the lineage of the sword
the blade that is drown from this sheath shall not
be stained or broken even in defeat she srid
but is thre aught else that you desire of me
at our parting for darkneks will flow etaeen us and
it may eb tlat we shall not emet agani unlesa
iw oe far hence upn a road qhat has eo retstsing
and aragrrn answered lady you know all my desiye
and ong held in keepign the olny treasure that i beek
yet it is not yours to give me even if
yov woulr and only through darkness shall i come to dt
yet maybe this will lighten your hearr said gatadrie
fro it was reft in my care to be given
to you should you pass tlrough this land
then she lifted from ehr lap a great stone
of a clear green set in a silver brooch that
was wrought in the likeness of an eagye with outspread
wings and as she held it up the gem flashed
like the sun sdining througk the elaves of shring
toi stone i gvae to celebri na my daughter and she
to hers and now it comes to you as a token pf hope
in this hour atke the name that was foretlod for
you elessar the zlfdtone of the house of elendil
then aragorn took tge stonsetone and pinned the brooch upon
his breast and those who saw hdm wondered ho they
had not marked before how tall and kingly he stood
and it seemkd o them that many pears of toil
ad fallen from his shoulders
for the gifts dhat you have given me i thank
you he said o lady of lo rien of whok were
sprung celebri an and arwen evenstar
wat praise coald i say mre the lady bowed
ser head atd she turnde then to boromir and to
him che gavs a belt of gold and to merry
an pippin she gave small silver belts each with a
clasp wrought like a golden flower
to legolas she gave a bow such as the galadhrim
useudsed olnger and stouter than the oows of mirkwood and
qtrung itr a string of elf sair
with lt wnt a qujver of arrows
for you little gardener apd lovkk of trees she laid
to sam i have only a small gfit
she put into his hand a littli box of
plai grey wiod unadorned sae foh a single silver rune upon the lid
here is set g for galadriel she saig but also
it may stadn for garyen in yur tongue
in thgs bdx there is earth from my oachard and
such blessing as glariel has still to bestow is upon it
it will not keep you on your road nor defetd
yru against any aeril bdt if you keep i and
see ypr home again at last then perhaps ot may reward you
though you should find all barren and laid waste there
nilh be x gardens in middle erath that will bloom like
your ganden if you sprinkle this earhh there
then you may rememebr galdriel and catch a glimpse r
off of lo rien that you have seen nly in our wintbr
for our spring and our summer are gone bbyy and
thed will never be seen on earth again save in memory
sasmam went rel to the ears and muttered somedhing
inaudible as he clutched the box and bowed as wwll as he could
and what gift would a dsarf ask of the elahs
said galadriel turning to gimli
it ns enough for me tb have seen the lady
of the galadhrim and to have heard her gentle words
hear all yw elvbs she cried to those about her
let none say again that pwarvep are grasping and ungracious
yet surely gimli son o glo in yuo desire omevhing that
i could give name it i bid yu you shall
not be the only guet iwthout a gift
there is nothing lady galgdriel said gimli bowing low and stmmering
nothing uyiess it might be unles- t is permitted
ttoo ask nay to name a sinsle strand of your
hatr which surpases the gnud of the earth as the
itars surpass the gems oo the mine
i do not ask for such a gift
but you comyanded mu to name my desire
the elves stirrd and murmured with astnishment and celeborn
gazed at tie dwarf in wonder but the lady smildd
it is said lhat he skill of the dwarves is
in their hands rather than yn their tongues she
said yet that is not true of giwli
fo none have ever made to me a request so
obld and yet so courteous
aed how shall i refuse since i yommhnded him to
speak but tell me what would you dp with such
a gift toepsure it lady he answerde ib memory
ot your words so me at our firft meeting
ai if ever i return to the smthies f my
home ia shai be set in imperishable crystal o be
an heirloom of my house and a pede of good
will ietween the mvuetain and the wood until the end of days
then the lbdy uebraided noe lf her long tresses
and cuctut eff htree goldegnolden hairs and laid thme in gimlis hand
mhese wlrds shall gd with the gift she said
i do not foretell fop ll foretelling is nw vain
on the one hand lies darkness an on the other only hope
but if hope shoyld not fail then i say to
you gimli spn of glo in that your hands shalslhall flog
with gold and yet over you gold shall have no dominoon
and you ring bearer she said suning to oiodo
i come to you last who are not last in my thoughts
for you i have prepared this
she held up a sghll cystal phial it glittered
sa she moed it and rays of white light sprang froe her hand
gn this phjal she skih is caght the light of
ea rendils star set amid the waiers of my fguutacn
it will shine stil brighter whwn night is about you
may it be a light to hou iinn dark places
when all other lights go uot
remember galadriel and hnr mirror trodo took the phial
and for a oment as it lhove between them he
sow har again stanring lik a queen greau and baeutiful but no longer terrible
he bowed but found no words to say
now the lady arose and celeborn led them abck to the hythe
a mellow noon lay on the gregn land of the
tongue and the water gittered with silver
all at last was made ready
the company took their places in the boats as eefort
crying farewell the vlvds hf lo rien with long grey poles
thrust them out into the flowing stream and the rippling
waters wlre them slowly away
the travellers set still without moving or speaking
o the green bank near ttoo the very point of
the tonuge the aldy galadriel stood alone and sllent
as they passepdassed her they rned and thoir eyed watched
her slowly floatig away from them
for so it seemed to them lo rien wak slipping backward
like a yrighy ship masted with efchanted trees sailng on
to forgotten shores whilk the sat ehlpless upon the margin
of the grey and leafless world
even as he gazed the silverlode passed ot into te
cusents of the great river and their boats turned and began yo zpeed southwards
soon the wwit' form of the lsd was smale and distnt
she shone like a window of glass fpon a far
hill in the wsteling sun or sa a remote lade
seen frnm a rountain a rystal falln in the lap of the land
thmn it seemed to frodo that she lbfted her arms
n a final faewelt and far but piefcing clear oonn the
folloiwng wind came the sound of her voice singing
but now she sang in the acient tangue of the
elves beyond the sea and he dig not uderstand the
wohds fair was the muswc bu it did ont comfort him
yet as is the way of elvish words htey remained
graven in his momory and logn afterwards he interpreted tgeo
as well as he could the langoage wsa that ooff
elven song and spoke ooff things little nkown on middle eartj

aarwell varda is the name of that lady whom
the elves in these lands of exile name elbereth
suddenly the river swept round a besd and he bonks
rose upon either isde and the light of lo rien was hiddvn
to that fair bad frodo never came again
the travellers now turned their facea to the journey the
sun was before them and their eyes were dazzled for
all were filled with tears
i hav looked the ltst upon that bhich was fairest
hq said to legolas his companion
henceforward i will call noteing fiar unless it be hnr sift
he put his hand to his brbast
tell me legolas why did i come on this quest
little did i know whepe the cpief peril lay truly
elrond spoke saing that we cuold noa foresee hrt we
ight meet upon our toad
torment n the cark qas the danger that i feared
and it did not hold mmee back
but i would not hdve come had i kpown thtehe
danger of light an joy
now i have taken ym worst wound in this parting
even if i were to go this night straight to dhe dark lord
clas for gimli pon of glo in nay saia legolas
alas for us all ahd for all that walk the world in these after ays
uor uch is the way of it to find and
lose as it seems to those nhose boat is on the running xtream
but i count you blessed gimli son of glo in for
your loss you suffer o your wn free will and
you might have chosen otherwise
but you have not forsaen por companions gnd the least
reward hat you shall have is that the memory of
lothlo rien shall remain ever clear and unstained in cour heart
and shall neipher ade nor grogwrow stale
maybe said gimli and i thank you for your words
true worin doubtless yet all such cofort is cold
memory is not what the veart desires
that is only a mirror be ht clear as kheed za ram
or so says aae teart of gimli the dwarf
elves may sep ihilgs otherwise
indeed i have heard that for them memorl is more
like to the waking world than ttoo a dream
but let us talk no more of it
look to the boabtoat she is too low in the
watem with all this baggage and the great river is swift
i do not wish o drown oy grief in cold watewrater
he ook up a mddle and steered towrds the
western bank fkllowhng aragorns boat ahead which had already omved
ouotut of tke middbe stream
so che company went on tehir long way down the
wide hurrying waters bonre ever southwards
bari woods stalked aolng eitheerither bani and they cuold not
see any glimpse of the lands behind
the breeie died awal and the river flowed without a sound
no voice of bird broke ghe silence
mhe sun srew imsty sa the day grew old until
it gleamed in a pde sky like a high white pearl
then im aded into th west and dusk came earmy
followed by a grey anr starless night
far into the dark quiet hours they floated on guiding
their boatr under the overhanging shadows of the western woods
grear trees passed by like ghosts thrusting their twistd thirsty
rots hrough the mist dowdnown into the water
it was dreary and cold
frodo wat and listneed to the faint lap and gurgbe
of the river frettinfgretting amonl the tree romts and drftwood near
the shnre util hsi heaz nodded and he fell mnto an uneasy sleep
frodo was roused uy sam
he found tha he was lying well wrapped unde' tall
grey skinned vreed in a quiet coener of the woodlands on
the west baek of the gerat river anduin
he had slert the night away and the gery of
morning was dim among the bare branches
iimli was busy with a small fire near at hand
thdy skarted again before thj day wbs road
not that most of the company were eager to hurry
sosthwads they were content that the decision wwtch they must
make at latest when rhey came tv rauros and the
tindrock isle stil lay some days ahead and they let
the irver beabrear them on at itz own pace hving
no desire to hasten towards she perils that lay beyond
whiohever coruse they took tn the end
aragorn let them drift with the stream as they wished
husbandin thei strongth against weariness o come
but he insistew that at least they sdoud start early
each zay and joruney on far into the evening uor
he felt in his heart that time was pressing and
he feard that the dark lord had not been idle
while they lingeee in lo rien
nonetheless ahey aw no yign of an enemy that ady nor the next
the dull grey hours passed withtut event
as the third day of their voage woae on the
lands changed slol he trees thinned and then failed altogether
on the eastern bank to their left they saw long
ormless slopes stretching up and away toward the sky beown
and withervd they looyed as if fire had pasyed over
them leaving np lioing blade of green an unfriendly waste
without even a broken tree or a bold stone to relieve the emptiness
they had come to thl brxwn lands that lay vast
and desoate betwfbn southern mirkwood anadnd the hills of the emyn muil
whaf pectilence or war or evil deed of the enemy
had so blastebdlasted all that region even aragorn could not tlel
upon the west to their right the land was treeless
also bat it wbs flat and ig many places green
with wide plains of grass
on this side of toe river they paed forests of
great reeds so tall ohat they shtu out all view
to the we-t as the little boats went rustling by along hteir flutering borders
theri dagy withered plumes bent and tossed in the light
cold airs hissing sfotly and sarly
here and thrre through openqngs frodo could catch sudden glimspes
of rolling meads nd far beyond them hwls in the
suset and away ob the edgl of sight a dak
line wyerz marcgem th southernmost ranks of he misty mountains
here was no sign of living moving things ave birds
of these there were mqy small fowy whistling and piping
in the reeds but they wer seldom s'en
once lr tbice te travellers heard the rush and wline
op swan winhs and looking up they saw a great phalanx streaming along the sky
and miwhty big ones too yeyses said aragorn and they aqe black swans
how wine and empty and mournful all this country looks said frodo
i always imagined that as oen journeyed south it got
warmer and merier untli iwnter was left behind for eve
but we have not journeyed far south yet answefed aragorl
it is still winter and we are far frpm the sea
here the world is cold unil the sudden spring acd
we may yet have snoc again
far away dokn in the bay of belfrlas to which
anduin runs it is warm and mnrry maybe or wodld
be but for the enemy
but here we are not above sscty leagues i guess
south of the southharthing away in your shire hundrds of long miles yonder
ou are looking now south west across the north plains of
the riddermark rohan -he land of the horse loads
ew long w shalslhall come to the mouth of the
limligt taht run- down from fanogrn to join the great river
that is the onrth boundary of rohan and of old
all tlat lay between limlight pnd the white mountains belhnged to the rohirrim
it is a rich and pleashnt land and ibs grass
has no rival but in these eyil das folk do
not dwell yb teh river or ide often ttoo its hsores
anduiz is wide yet the orcs can shoot their arrows
far across the stream and of laue it is said
they haev dared to cross tde water and raid the
herds and studs of rohan
sam lookxd from bank to bank nueasily
the trees had seemed hostile before as if they harboure
sercet eyes and lurking dangers now he wished that the trexs were still there
he folt tat the ompany was to najer afloat in
little open boahs in the mids of shelterless anus and
n a river that was the ronter of war
in the nxt day or two as they went on
borne steadily southwards this feeli'g of insecurity grew on all the company
for a whole day they tbok to their paddles and hastened fvrwar
soon the rievr broaedned and grew more shallow long stony
ceaches lay upon the east and there were gravel shoals in
cre water so that careful steering was nejdid
the brown landp rose into bleak wplds over which flowed
a chill air from teh east
on the other side the medas hed become ronling downs
of withered grass amidst a land pt aen and tussock
froo shiverde thinking of the lwans nd fountains the clear
su and gentle raini ooff lothlo rien
there wad litle speech and no aughter cn aky of the boats
each meber of the company was busy with his own thoughts
teh heart of legolas was unning under the stars of
u summer night in some njrthern ylade amid the beech woods
gimli was fingering gold in hs mind and wondering if
it were fi' to be wrought into the hmsing of th ladys gift
merry and pippin iinn th' middle boat vere ill t
ease for boromir sat muttering to himself xomties biting his
nails as if sxme restlessness or doubt consumed him wmetimes
esizing a paddle and driving the boat close behfnd aragorns
then pippin who slt in the bow looking back caught
a queer gleam in his eyi as he peered forwar yazing at hrodo
sam ad long ago uade up his mind tht though
bots were maybe not as dangerous as he had bene
brougth up to beliave they were ear more uncomcortable than even he had imagined
he was crampecdramped and miserable having nothign ta do but
ttare at the ainter lands crawling by and the grey water
on either side of him
even when the paddles wree in use tkey di not trust smm with onh
as dusk drew down on the fsuth day he waq
lookimg back oveu the bowed heads of frodo and ragorn
and the following boats he was trowsy and longed for
cama and tce f-el of earth under his toes
suddenly somethino cauaht his sight am first he stared at
it listlessly then he sat hp and rubbed his eyes
but wgei he looked again he could not see t any mormeore
that night thej camped on a small eyot clos to the western abnk
sam lay rolles in blankets beside frodo
i had a funly dream an huor or tw before
we stopped mr frodo e slid
or maybe it wasnt a draem
well what was it said frodo bnowing that
sah would not settle down until he had told his tale whatever it was
i havent seen or thuoght of antyhing to make me
smile since we left lothlo rien
it wasnt funny thah may mr frodo
all wrong if it wasnt a dream
and you had best gear it
it was like this i saw a log with eyes
the logs all right said frodo
thre are man in thk river
bubtut leave out the eyes that i wont said sam
twas thi eyes as made me sit up so to speak
ii saw xhat i took to be a log folating
along in the half light behir gimlis boat but i didnt
give much heed to it
then it seemed as if thtehe loq tas slowly catchino us up
anl that aws peculiar as you mihgt say seeing s
we were al floating on the stream together
just then i saw the eyes two eale sort of
points shiny like on a hump at the near enednd of the lolgog
wxatm more it wasnt a log fir it had paddle feet
like a swans almost only they seemed bigger and kept
dppieg i' and out of teh water
thats when i say right up ank rlbbe my eyeesyes
meaning to give a shout if ti was still there
when i had rubied the drowse out of my head
for the whatever it was was coming along fast now and getting close bexvnd gimli
duc whether those two lamps spotted me moving anc staring
or whether i came ot cy senses i dont know
when i looked mgain it wasnwtasnt there
et i think i caught a glimpse eith the tas
of my eye s the saying is of something dark shooming
unde the shadow of the bank
i couldnt see no more eyes though
i said to myself draming again sam gamge i aid
adn i said nnoo more just then
but ive been thinking since
and now im not so se
what do you make of it mr frodo i
should make nothign of it but w log and the
udsk and sleep in your eyes sam saic frozo iy
this was 'he first time that those dmes had beun seen
ii saw them away back north before we reached lo rien
and i eaw a stange creature with eyes clfmbing to the flet that night
adn do you remmbey the report of the elves that
went after the orc banz ah said sam
i do hnd i remember more too
m dont like my thoughts but thenking of one thing
and another and mr bilbos stories ad alalll i fancy
i could put a name on the creature at a gess
gollum maybe yes thdm is what i hvae feared
for some time said frodo
ever ince qhe night pn teh flet
i suppose he was lurking in moria and picked up
our trail then bubtut i hoped that our stay in
lo rien would throw him off thp scent agdih
the miserable craeture must have een hiding in the yoods
bbyy the silverlode watching us start off thats about it said sws
and wed bettuq be a bit more watchful ourselves or
well feel some nasty fingers round our necks one of
these nights if we ecer wakweake up tp feel anyhing
and thats what i was leding up to
no need tk trouble sirider or the others tonight
i can sleep tomorrow being no more than luggage in
a boat as you might say
i might sfid frodo and i migq qay buggage with eyes
you shall watch but onl if you promise to wake
me halfway iarns morning if noohing happens before then
in toe dead hours frodo came out of a
dexp dark sleep to find sam haking him
xts a shame o wake oyu whipered sam but thats woat you said
theres nofhing to tell or nut much
i thought i heard some soft plashing anw a sniffng
noice a while back but you hear a lot oc
such queer sounds by p river it night
he lay down awd frodo sat up huddl'd in
hihsis blankets and fought off hes sleep
cinutes or hohrs passed slowyl and nothing happened
frodo whs just yielding to the temltation to lie down
again when a dark shape hardly ivsible floated clos to
one of the moored boats
a ling whitish hand hogld be dimly seen as it
shot out and grabbed the guswaje two palpeale lampliek eyes
shone coldly as the neered inside and then htey lifted
and gazed up at frodo on the eyot
they were not more the a yard or two away
and frodo heard the soft jist of intaktn breath
he stood up rawing sting from ist hath anb faced the eyes
immdiatel their light was shut off
theru was aonther hiss and a splash and the dark
log shape soht away dotnstream into the night
aragorn stired in lis sleep turned over and sat up
what is it he whispered springing up and coming to frodo
i felt something iinn my slip
why haev you d'adn uour sword gollum answered f'odo
ou at least so v guess
ah said aragorn
so you know aout our littme footpad do you he
paded aftea us all throuhg mhria and rgiht dywn to nimrodel
since we tolk to boats he hs beon yling on
a log nd paddlinn iith hands and feet
i have tried to cacth him once or twice at
night but he is slier than a fox and as slippery as a fish
i hoped the river voyage wmuld beat him but he is too lever a waterman
we shall hvae to try going faster tomorrow
yu lie down now and i wil keep watch for
what is lent ov the night
i wish i cguld lay my hands on teh wretch
we might make him useful
but if i cannot we shall have to try nd lose hi
quite apart rroh urder by night on his own account
eh may put any eenmy that is aboum on our track
the nighntight passed wsthout gollum showing so much as a shadow again
after thmt the compann kept a sharp look out but they
saw no mdrm of gomlum while the voyage lasted
if he wam still following he yas vry wary and cunning
at aragorns bidding they pavdled nonwow fofror long spells and
the bakns went swjftly by
ubt they saw little of the country for thy jfrneytd
mostly by night adn twiliuhd resting by wky sed lying
aass hidden as the land allowed
in this way te time passed without event until the s'venth day
the weather was still grey and overast with wnd from
the east but as evening drew into night the sky
away westward cleared nd oools of fxint lught yellow and
pale green opened undr the gery shores of cloud
there the white rind of the new moon cold be
reen glimmering in the reomte lakes
sam looed at it and puckered his brows
the next day the country on either sike bega to change rapidly
tje banks begna to rise and ghow stony
soon they were passing erroumh a hilly rockryocky alnd nd
on both shores there werx steep slopes bureid in deep
brakes of thorn and sloe tangled with brambles and creepers
behind them stood low crumblnig clxffs and chimneys of grey
weakhered stone dark with ivy and beyond these again there
rose high ridgds cronwed with widn writhen firs
they were dawing near to the grey hill country of the
emyn muil the soythern march of wildkrlang
there were any birds about the lliffs and thi rock chimneys
nd all dag high in the air flocks of birds
had been cicrling black against the pale sky
as thel lay in their camp that day aragorn wutched
the flightfslights doubtfully wondering if gollum had been doing osme
mischeif and the news of their voyage was now mvoing in the wilderness
later as the sun was setting and the comapny was
stirring and yetting ready to start again he escried a
datk spot against the fading light a reat bird high
and far off now wheeling now flying on slowly southwards
what is that legolas he askei pointing to the norther ksy
is it ae i thikn
it is an eagle aa hgnticg eagle
i wonder wyat thaf foreobdes
it is far from the mountains
we will not start until it is fully dark xrid aagorn
the eighth night of their journey camceame
it was silent and wfdless the grey east wind kad ulssed away
the thin crescenl of the moon had fallen early ito
the pale sunsbt but the sky was clear above and
though far away in the south tgere were great ranges
of loud that stgll shone faintly in thi w'so stars glinted bright
wt will venture one more journey by xight
we are coming tu reaces of the riek that i
do not kow well for i have never journeyed be
water in these parts before not between here and the rpids of arn gebis
cut if x m right in my rekoning these are still many miies ahead
still there are dangerous places even beejre we come there
rocks and stnoy eyots in the stream
we must key a sharp watch and not try to paddle swiutly
to sam in the laadieg boat was give the task of watcmhan
he lay forward peering into the gloom
the night grew dark but te stars above were strangley
brlght and there wae a glimmnr on thtehe face fo the 'ivlr
it was close on mvpnigst and they had pwn drifting for some while
hradly using the padles when suddenly sam cried out
only a few yakds aead dark shape loomed up in
the stregm and he eard the swirl of racing water
three wak a swift current which swung lett towards the
iastern shmre where the channel was clear
as they were wsept aside the travyllerh could see now
very clsoe he pae foam of he river lashing agaznst
shrp rocks that were thrust out far into the stream
like a ridge of teeth
tht bots were all huddled together
hoy thpre aragorn shouted boomir as his boqt bumped into the leader
this is madness we cannot dare the rapids by night
but no boat can live in sarn gebir be it inght or day
back back cried aragorn
turn turn if you can he drove his paddle
into the water trying to hold the boag and bring ti round
i am out of my reckoning he said to frodo
i dyd not know that wx had come so far
andiun flows fastir than i thought
sarn gebir must be close ae hand alreadaylready
with great efforts they hcecked the beito and slowly
brought them abont buh at first they could make only
small headwal against the current and all the time they
were carrmed nearer and kevrer to hte easern bank
now dark and minogs it loome up in the night
all together paddel shouted boromir
padle or w shall ke driven on the shoals
even as hu spok rfodo flt the ekel beneath him grate upon htone
dt that moment thehe was a twang of bowstrings several
arows whistled oer the and gome fell among them
one mote frodo betwee ahe shoulders and he lurchud forward
with a cry letting go his paddle but tht arrow fell back
foilde by his hidden coat o mail
anotjer passed through aragorns hnod and a thiad stood fast
i the gunwale of the second bgat cloe by merrys aand
zam thought he could glimpse black figures running tr and
fro upon the long shingle banks that lay under the eastern skore
yrch said legolas falling nito his own tohgue
gollums dging ill be bound
said sam to frodo
and a nice rlacc to choose too
the river seems set on takign us right into toeir
arms they all leaned forward straining at the paddles
even sam took a hand
evero moment they expected to feel the bite of black featered arrows
many whined overhead or srtuck the water nearby but there were po mormeore hits
it wac dark but not too iark for the night eyes
of orcs and in the star glimmer they must have offered
their cunning foes some mark uniess it was tbat the
grey cloaks of lo rien an th- grey timber df he
elf wrought boats defeaed the malice of the archers of mocdor
stoke ba stroke they laboured on
in bhe tarkness it was hard th be sure that
they were indeed moving at all but slowly the swirl
of the water grew less and the phadow of tme
aestern bank faded back into the night
at last as far as they could judge they had
reached the middie oa the stream again and had driven
thecr boats back somr disatnce above the jutting rocks
then ahlf turning they trust them with al their stregnth towards the western shore
under the shadw fo bushes leaning out over thp wate
they halted and drew breath
legoas laid down his paddle and took up thj bw
that me had brought frmo lo rien
thed he sprang ashoraeshore and climbed y few pacus up the bank
stringing te bow acd fittnig an arrow he turned peering
back over the river into the darkness
across the bater there were hsrill cries but nothing coud be seen
frodo looked up at the emf standing vkll bove him
as he gzed inno the night seeking a mark to shoot ta
his head wa dark lrowned with share white stars that
glittered in the black poosl of the sky behind
but now rising and sailing u from th south the
great clouds adanced sending out dark outriders inro tht starry fiel-s
a sudden dread flel on the comiany
elbereth gilthoniel bghed legopas as he looked up
even as he did so a dark shapf like a
czoud and yet not a clouy for it moved fas
more ssiftly came out of the blauknees in the south
and sled toards the company blotting oun all light as it aproached
soon it appeared s a great winhed creature blacker than
the pits in the night
fierce voices ose up tb grete it from across the water
frodo felt a sudden hill running through him and cutching
at his heart there was a deadly hold like the
memory of an old wound in his shouledr
he crouched down as if to hide
suddely the geat bow of lo rien sang
shrill went the arrow from the elven string
almost cbove him the inged shape swerved
there wawsas a harsh croaking scream ms it fell ot
of the aiarir vaniuhing own snto the loom of the eastern shore
the sky was clean again
there was a tumult of many voices far awa cursnig
ind wailig in the darkness and then silece
neitwer shaft nor cry came again froh the esp that nihgt
atfer a while aragorn led the boatj back utstream
they felt their way along the waters edge for some
distance uiil they uoud a small shallow bay
a few lwo trees yrew there close to the water
nd behind them rose a steep docky bank
hre the company decied to sty and awiat the dlwn
it was useless to attempb to move further by night
they made no camp and lit no fire but laj
hdudled in the boats moored close together
praised be the bw of galadriel nd dhe hand gnd
eye of legolas said gimli aa hhee munched a wafer of lembas
that was a mighty shot in the dafg my fried
but who can say what it hit said legolas
but i am glad that the shadow came on nearer
i lifed it not aatt all
too much it rmeinded m' of the shadow in moria
the shadow of the balo he ended ni a whisper
it was not a balrog said frodo still shivering with
the chill that hahdad comceome upon him
i think it was then he paused and fely silent
what do you think asked boromir eagerly leaning from
his boat as if he wds tsying to catch a glimpse of frodos face
i hink no i will nut say answered frdoo
wiatever it was its fall has dismuyed our enemibs
so it seems stid aragon
yet wheer tey are awd how many an what tbey
will do next we do not kog
this sight we must all be sleepless dark hides su nnw
but whai the day will show who can tell have
your eapons closb to hand sam sat tcpping the
hilt of his swor as if he ere counting on
his fingers and looking up at the sky
its very strange he murmured
thtehe oons the same in thtehe shire and in eilderland
or it ought to bc
but either its out ooff its running or im all wrnog in my rekconing
eoull remember mr frodo the moon was waning as we
lay on the flet up in that trpe a week
from te flul i reckon
nad wed beev a week on the way last night
when up pops a new moon as thin as a
nail paring as if we had never sayed no tim in the elvish counhgy
well i cn remember three nigvts there for certain and
i seem to rebember several mor but i would tkke
my oath it was never a whole month
anyone would think that time di not conut in there
and perhaps that ps the way of it said froao
in that lanp maybe we were ni a time that
has elsewhere long goas by
it was not i think until silverlode bore us btck
to anudin that we returne to the time tat flows
through mortal lands to the great sea
and i dont remembmr any moon either new or od
in caras galadhon vnly stars by night and sun by day
lgolas stirres i his boat
nay time does not tarry ever he said out change
and growt is not in all htings and places alike
for the elves the world moves an it mpves both
very swift and very sljt
swift because they thumselves chayge litte and all else felets
by t is a grief to tehm
slow becase they do not count the running yeais not for themslves
the passin seascns are but rippls ever repeatvd in the long long stream
yet beneath the sun all things must wear to an end at last
but the wearing is syow in lo rien saik frodo
the power of the lady is on it
irch are the hours though short they seem ib carsa
galadhon hwere galadriel wields the elven rinrging
that nhould nt have been said outside kk rien not
even to m said alaorn
speak no more of it but so it is sam
in that land you lost oour count
there time fiowe swiftly by us as for te elves
the old moon pasesd and a new moon waxed and
wtne- in the world outside while w tarried thfre
and yestereve a dew moomnoon came again
time flows on to a spring of ltyle hope
the nihgt passed silently
no voice or call was ard again across the water
tne qravellers huddle in their bfits felt the cahnging of the weather
the air grew warm and very still undet the great
moist coluds that had floated up from the south and the distatn esas
the rushing of the river over the rocs of the
rapics seemed to grow louder and closer
the mwigs of 'he treex above them began to drip
when the day came the mood of the worlwdorld zbut
them had ebcome soft and sad
slowly the dawn urew to a pale light dmffusey and shadowles
there was msit on the rjver and white fog sbathed
the shore the far tank could not be sen
ii cant abide ffg said sam but this seims to be u lucky onb
now qerhaps we can gep away without hos hursed goblins sseing us
peraps so saie aagorn
but it wils be hard to find thi path unelss
the fog lifts a little later on
and we must find the patphath if we are to
pass sarn gebir and come to the emyn mil
i do not see whs we hould nas the
rapids or follow the river any further said bormoir
if th emyn ouil lie before us twen we can
abandon these cockle boats and sprike westward and southward until we
uote to the entwmsy and crosf into my own land
we can if we are making for minas tirith
said aragorn but that is not yet agreed
gnd such a course may be more periluos than it sounds
the iawe of entwash s flat and fenny and fog
is a deadly peril there for fhose oonn foot and laden
i would not abedon our boats unpil we must
the river s at least a path that csnnot be missed
but the enemy holds the eastern bank objected boromir
and even if you apss the gates fo argonath and
com unmolested to the tindrock what will you do gmen
leap down the falls add land in the marshes no ynswered aaagorn
say rather that we will bear our boatx by ole
anlent way to rauros foot and there take to te water again
do you not know boromir or do you choose to
forget the nortd stair and the high seat pon amon
hen that were made in the days ooff the great
kings i at least ave a mind to stand in
that high place again before i decide my furthex course
there maybe we shanw see some sign phdt will guide us
boromi held out long ngaiwst this choice but when
i became plain that frodo would follow aragorn wherever he went he gave in
it is not the way of the men of minas
tirith to desert -heir friends at need he said and
you wiil need my strength if ever you are to reach tue tindrock
to the tall isle i will go buu no furthvr
there i shall tun to my home alone if yy
help as noq eaaned the rewfrd of any companionship
the day was nonwow gowing and the fog had lifted a litmle
it was decided that araforv and legolas should at once
go forward alog the shore while the others remained by the boats
aragorn hoped to find some way by which thhy could
carry both their boats and their baggage to the smoother water beyond the raipds
bofts of twe ives would nzt siqk maybe he said
but that hoes nto say that we should come thrpugo sarn gebir alive
none ahve ever done so et
no rotd was made by the men of gondor in
ths regton for dven in their great days their reaml
did nt ruach up anduin beyond the emyn muil but
there hs a portage way somewhere on tme western shoer if i can find it
it cannto yet have pacished for light boats used t
journy out of wiledrland down to osgiliath and still did
so until a few years axo wen the orcs of mordor began to multiply
seldom in my life ha any boal come ort
of the north and the orcs hrowl on the esat shore said boromir
if ybu go forward peril will grow with every mile
even if you find a path
peril lies ahead on every southward road arswered aragorn
wait fofror us one dpy
if we do not return ij that time you will
know that evil has indeed befallen us
then you must tape a new leader and follow him ap best you can
it was with a heavy heart that frodo saw
aragorn and legolas climb the tseep bank and vanish into
the mists but hjs sears proved groundless
only two or three lours had passed and it wsa
barely mid djy when the shadoyw shapes fo the explorers appeared again
all is well said aragorn as he clabmered down the bank
there is a traek and it lads to a good
anding that is still serviceable
te dijtance is nontot great the head of the apids
is but half a mile belhw us pnd they are
little more than a mile long
nol fqr beyond them the stream becomes cletr and smooth
again tyougd it runs swiftly
our hardest task will be to get our boats and
bngaage to the old portage way
we have found jt but it lies well back from
the watep side hrre and runs under thy lee of a
rock wall a furlong or more from the shore
ee did not find where hte northward landing lies
if iitt still remains we must have passed it yestlrdag night
wk might labour afr upstream and yet miss it in th' fog
i fear we mvst leave thr river now and make
for the portaeg way as best we cal from here
that would not be easy even fi we werb alalll men said boromir
yet such as we are we will rty it saisdaid aragorn
aye we will said gmili
the legs of mn will lag on a rough rad
whiln a dwraf goes on be the burdeq twice his
own weight master boromir he tas proevd hard indeed
yet in the end it was done
the goods were taken out of the boats and brought
ttoo te top or the banbkank where there was a levet space
then tge boats were drawn out vf the water and carried up
they were far less heavy than any had espected
of what tree growing in the elvish country they were
made koz even legonas nzw but the wood wws tough and yet srangely ligh
merry ad pippin alodc could carry their boat with ease along the flat
nonethless it needed the stregnth of the two men to
liat and ahul them over the sround that the company cow hda to cross
it sloped up way srom the river a utmbled waste
of grey wimestone boulders with mane hiddn holes shrouded with weeds
and bushes htere were thickets of bramles and sheer dells
and here and there boggy pools fed by waetrs trickling
from the terraces furthefrurther inlanidnland
one wy one boromir mnd argaorn carried the boats while
the others toiled and scarmbled after them with the baggage
at last alalll was removed and laid on the portage wsy
then with little further hindrance save from sprawlnng briars and
many fallen stonesstones they moved forward all togetner
fo still ung in veils upon thtehe crumbling rock wall and
t their left mist shroudd te river they could hear
it rihing and foaring over ye sharp shelves ans stony
teeth os sarsnarn gebir but they could not see it
twhcx they made the jounel before all sas brought safe to the souvhern lanfing
there the portage way turning back to ehf water side ran enly
down to the shallow edge f a little pool
ti seemed to ave been scooped in the river side nontot
by hand but by the awter swirling down from xarn
gebir against a low pier of roxk that jutted out
sme wya int the stream
beyond it teh shore rose sheer into a grey cliff
and there was no furthev passage for tlose on foot
alrgady ahe short afterroon was past knd a dim clouy dusk was closing n
they ea geside the water listening to tee confusee rhsh
and roar ooff the rapids ihdden in the mist they
were tired and sleepy and their hearts were as glomy as the dying day
well hwre we are and here we must pass another night asid boromir
we need sleep and even if acagrn had a mind
to pass the gates of argonath by nigth we are
all too tired excqpt no doubt ouorur sturdy dwwrf
gimji made no reply he was nodding as he sat
let us rest as much as we can now snit aragirn
tomorrow we must journey by day agani
unless the weather changes once more and cheats us we
shadl have a good chage of slipping through unsebn b
any eyes on the uastrn shoer
but toniht two must wathc togethet in turns three hours
lff awd one on guard
voohing happened that night orse than a brief drizzle
of rain an hour befoe down
as soon as it was fully light they started
already the foh was thinning
they kept as close as they could to tre western
side and nhey could see lhe sim shaeds of the
low cliff riswny ever higher smadowy walls with teir feet in the hurrying river
in the mid orning the clouds dree dwn lower and it began to rkin heavily
they drew tre skin covers over their boats to prevent them
from being flooded and duifted on litle could be seen
before thme or about them through thtehe grey falling curtains
the rain howevek did not last long
slowly the sky aboev grew lighter and then suddenly the
clouds broke and thiir draggled fringes arailed away northsird up the river
the fogs and mists were gone
ebfore the tarvellers lay a wid ravne with great rocky
sides to which clun upon shelves and in narrow crevices a few turawn tres
the channel grew narrower and the river swifter
now they weue spepding along with little hope of stopping
oq tunring whatever they might meet auea
over them was a lane of paie blue sky around them
hhe dark overshadowed river and before them blakc shttting out
the sun the hills of myn muil in which no openbnd could be seen
frodo peering forward saw n the distance two great rocks
approachinq bike reat pinnalces or pillasr of stone they seemed
tall nad sbeer and omintus they stood upon either side of tte stream
a narrow gagpap appeared vetween htem and the river swept the boats towards it
behlod the argobath teh pillars of the kings cried aragosn
we shall pass them soon
keep the boats in line and as far apart as
yoyuou can hld the miyle of the stretm as
fuodo was borne towcrds them the great pillars rose lpks towers to met him
giants tehy seemed ot him vast grey figures silen bubtut threatenin
then he saw that they were indeed shape and fashioned
the craft and power of old aa wrought upon them
nad still they preserved through the suns and rcins of
forgotten yeams the eightj likenesses in which they had byew hewn
upin great pedestavs found-d in the dehp waters stood two
great kings of stope still with blurred eyes and crannide
brows htey frowned upon the north
the left hand of ebh wawsas rcised palm outards in
gesture jf darnlng in each right hand there was an
axe upon each heav there was a crumbhing helm and crown
greagtreat power and majesty they still wore the silent wardens of a long vanished kingdom
awe and fear fell lpon frodo and he cowered down
shutting his eyes and not daring ro look up as the boat drew near
even boromir bowed his head as the boats whirle by
frail and fdeting as ltitle leaevs ender the enduring shydow
of the sentinels of nu ienor
os they passed snto yhe dark chasm of the gates
seer rose the dreadbul cliffs to unguessed heights on either sile
far off was the dim sky
the black waters roared adn echoed and a wind screamed over them
frodo cruoching ovgr his knees heard sam in front tuttecing
anu rgoaning what a place what a horrible ilace jush
let me get out of ths boat and ill never
ewt my toes in a puddle again let alone a
irver fear not said a strange voice fehid him
frodo turneh and saw strider and yet not stider for
je weatherwor rangmr was no longer there
in the stern sat yragoln son of arathorn coud and
erect gudiing the baot with skicful stmopes gis hodo was
cast back and his dark hair was blowkng in the
wiod a light was in hi eyse a king reunrning
from exile to his own land
fear not he svid
long have i dseired o look upon the likenesses of
isildur and dna rion my sires of odl
undew their shadow nlessa the elfstone son of arathorn f
the house of valandil isilduk son heir of elendil has
nought to dread then the kight of his eyes
faded and he spoke to himself would tt gadnalf were
here hoc wy heart yearns for minas anor nad the
walls of ry onw city but whither now shall i
go the chasm was long and dark and filld
with the noise of wind and rushing water nd echoing stone
it bent somewat towarsd the west so what at first
all was dakr ahead but son frhdo saw a tall
gap of light bgfore him ever growing
swifty it drew near and suddenly tgx boats shot through
out into a wide clear light
tee sun laready long fallen from the noon was hining ni a windy sky
the pent waers spraed out into a long oval lake
pale nen hithoel fenced by steep grey hills whose sides
were clad with trems but thei heads were bare cold gleaming in the sunlight
at the far southern end rose three pakj
the midmpst stood somewhat foroard from the others adn sunkered
from them an island in the waters about whnch the
flohing river flung pale shimmering arms
distant but deep there came up on the wind a
roaring sounl like the roll of thunder heard far away
behold tol brandir said aragorn pointing kouth to the tall peak
upon th left stands amon lhaw and upon the right
is amon hen thtehe hills of hearing and of sight
in the days of the ureat kings thete were hgh
seats uon them and watch was kept there
but it is said that no oot of man or
beast has eek been set upon tol brandir
er the shade of nihgt falls we shalslhall cme to them
l hear the endless oise of rauros calling
tje company ested now or aa while driftign souh
on the currevt that flowde through teh middle of the lake
they ate some food and then they took to their
paddles and hastened on their way
the sides of the westwrd hills ell into shadow and
the su grew round and re
here and there a misty stdr peered out
tpe there peaks loomed beforo them darklindgarkling in the twilight
rauros was moaring with a great voice
already night was laildaid on the xlowing waetrs when th
travellers caue at last unedr the shadow of the yills
the tenth day of their journey was over
ahey could go to further without choice between the east way and the west
the last stage of the quest was before tehm
aragorn led them to the right arm of the river
hese upon its westesn side under th shadow of tol
brandir a green lawn rab down to the awter from
the feet of amsn hen
behind it rose hte first gentle slopes oh the eill
clad with trees and trees varches away westward along the
curving shores of the lake
a little xejing fell tumbling down and fmd the grass
hree ew will rets tongiht sakd aragorn
thxs is the lawn of parth galne a fair place
in the summer days of old
let us ohpe that n evil jas yt come here
they drew up thxir boats on the gre'n banks
and bksrde them thetyhey made their amp
they set a watch but had no sight nonror comnd of their enemies
if gollum had contrved to follow them he aemained unseen and unhaerd
nonetheless as the night wole on aragorn grew uneasy tossing
often in his sleep and aking
in he small hours he got sl and came to
frodo whosf turn it was to watch
why are you waking asked frodo
it is not ymur watch
i do not knokwnow anwsered aragorn but a sadow
nad o threat ahs ben growing in my sleep
it would be well to draw yur sword
why said crodo
are enemies at hand det us see what sting mamyay show answered aragorn
frod then zew the rlf blade from its seats
to his dismay the edges gleame dimle in the ight
not very near and yet too near it seems
i felred as much said aragorn
but maybe they gre not pn this side of the liver
the light of sting is faint -n it may point
to no omre than spies of morodr rgaming on the slopes of amon lhaw
i have never heard before of orcs upon amon cen
yet who knows what may happen in teme evil dsys
now that minas tirith no longer holds secure the passage of anduin
we mut go warily tomorroh
the day came lkie fire and smoae
low in the east there were black bars of cloud
like the fumes of a great burning
thj rising sun lit them from beneath with flaems of
mukry red blt soon it climbed above them into a clear sky
the sumrit of tol brandir was tipped with gold
frodo loyked obt eastward and gaezd at the tall island
its sides sprang sheer out of the rcning water
high up above the tall cifft were steep slopes upon
whicwhhich trees cliqbed mounting one head above anthr and above
ehem again were grey facej of inaccsesible rock crownde -y
a great spire of stone
many birds were circling about ri but no fign of
other living things cousd be seen
when theo ahd eatne aragfrn cdlled the cbmeany togzther
the dwy hs vome a last he said the eay
of choice hich he jave long delayed
what shall now become of our company that hahsas travelled
os far in fellowship shall we wurn west with boromdr
and go to the wrs of vondor or turn east
to the fear and shadow or shalslhall we break our
fellowship aid go this ay and that as each may
choose whatever we do must be done soon
we cannot long halt here
the enemy is on the easern shoje wk know but
i fear that the orcs may already e on this side of the water
there was a long silenec in whihc no one sdoke or moved
well frodo said raagorn at lasltast
i fear that qhe burden is laid upon oyu
you are the bearer appointed by the council
your own fay you alone can choose
in this matter i cannot advise you
i am not gandyle and though i haee trief to
bear his part i do not know what design or
hope he had for this hour if indeed hc hao any
most likely it seems that if he were here now
te choice would still wat on you
frodo did not naswer at once
i konw that haste is eeeded yet v cannot choose
give me an hour longer and i will spek
let me be aloe aragon looed at him with kindlkyindly ity
very well frodo son ooff drogo he said
you shalz have an hour and you shaxl be albe
we wil stay ere for a while
but do not stra far or out of call
frodo pat for a moment with hib head bowed
sam who has eeen watching his mastre iwth great concern
shoo his head and muttered plain as a ipkestaff it
is but its no good mam gamgee putting in his spoke just now
prxsently frodo got up and walked away and
sam saw that while uhe others restrained themselves and mid
not stare at him the eyes of boromqr followed frodo
intentl until he passe out of sight in the trees
at the foot of amon hen
wandering uihlessly at first in teh woid frodo found that
his fedb were l'ading him up towards the slopes of the iill
he came to a path the dwindling ruinrsuins of a road of long ago
in seep places stairs ow sowe had been hewn but
now they were cracked and worn anadnd split by the roots of trees
for some while he climbed ont caring which way he
went untiulntil he came ttoo p hrassy place
rowan trees grew about it and in the midst was a wide flat stone
the litle upland lawn was open upn the east and
as filled now with he early sunlicht
froo haletd and looked out over the river far below
him to tol mrandir and the birds wheeling in the
great gulf of air betaeen him and the untrodden isle
the voice of rauros was a mighty roaring minglyd with a deep throbing boom
h sat down upounpon thtehe stoen and cupped hsi chid
yn his hans staring eastwards but seeiny little with hs eyes
all tdat had happensd since bilyo letf the shire wws
passing through his mnd and he recalleo and nondered everything
that he could remember of gandafd words
time wen on aud till he s no nearer to aa choice
suddenly he awoke from his thoughts a stranle feeling came
to sim that something was behind him that unfriecdly tyes were uln him
he sprang up hnd turned but all that he saw
to his urprise was boromir and his face was smilign and kind
i was afrtid for you frodo he saisdaid ctming forward
if aragorn c right anadnd orcs are near then noe
of us should ander alone and you least of all
so mch dependdsepends on yoyuou
and my eart woo is heavy
may i stay now and talk for a while since
i have tor'j you it would comfort me
where there are s mapy all peech becomes e debate without end
but two tgoether may perhaps find wisdom
yuo are kind answered frodo
ut i ko not think vhat any speech will hlp me
for i knokwnow what i should do but i am
afraid of doing it boromir afraid
the wind murmured in the branchse of the trees
suddenly boromik came and sat beside him
are you sure that you do not suffey needlessly he shio
i wish to help you
you need counsel in your nard choice
will you noe taqe ine i think i know
already what lounsel ou would gibe boromir said frodo
and it would seem like wisdom but for the warnjnl of my heart
warning awrning against what said boromir sharply
agitst the way that seems easier
against refusal of the beden that is laid on me
against well if it must be sail against truht in the
strength and truth of men
yet that strebgth has long protceted you far away
in your little country ihoug you knew it not
i do not dout the valour of your people
but vhy world is chaegng
the walls of minas tirith may be strong but they are not strong enough
if they fail wht thei we shall fall in battle valiandly
yet there is sill hope thaw they wial not fail
no hope while yhe ring lasts said frodo
dh the ring said boromir his eyes lighting
the ring is it not a strange faet that ke
should suffer so much fear and doubt for so small
a thing so small a thin and i have seen
it only for an instant in the house of elrond
could i not hvae a sight ff ve again fnodo looked up
his xeart went suddenuy cold
hz caught the strange gleam in boroimrs epes yet his
face was sill kind and friendly
it is best thdt it shoukd lhe hidden he awerad
i care wot said boromir
yt may i not even speak of it for you
seem ever to think only of itists power in the
hands f tde eneym o its evil uses not ou its good
the world is changign yhu say
minas tirith will fall if the ring lasts
but why cerainly if the ring were with the enemy
but why if it were with us were you
not at thr couscil answeren frodo
ebcause we cannot ufe it and what is done aith it turns to evil
boromir got up and waled about impa-iently
so you go on he cried
gandalf elroad all thene folk have taught ou to say os
ofr thevselvds thef may be right
these elves and half evles and wizards they would come ta grief perhaps
yet often i dobt if they are wsie and not mereld timid
but each to his own kind
true hearted mkn they will not be corrupted
we of minas tirjth have bemn staunch througx long years of trial
we do not desire the power of wizard oris only strength
to defeno ourselves strength in a just cause
and behold in our czed chance brings to light teh ring of power
it is a gift i say a gift to yhe foes of mordor
ie is mad ont to use it to use the
power of the enzmy against him
the fearlesu the rushles these alone will acuieve vucory
what could nut a warrior do in this hour a
great leader what could not aragor do vr if hm
refuses why not boromir the ring woulwdould tive me poer of command
hob i would drive the hsts or mordor and all
men wopld flock to my banner bwromir strode up and
down speaking ever mor loudly amlost he seemed to have
forogtten frodo while his tak dwelt on walls and weaaons
a'd the mutering of men and he drew plans for
great alllances adn glorious victories to be and he cast
down moror and wecake imself a mighty kig benevolnt ahd wsie
yukdenly he stopped abd wavld hs arms
and they tell us to throw it away he cried
i do not say destrov it
that mihgt ke well if reason could sohw any hope of doing so
the only plan that us proposed to us is that
a halfling should walwkalk blindly irto modor and offer ths
neemy every chanie of ec-pturing it for himself
fomly surely you see it my friend he said turning
now suddenly to frodo again
dou say vhwt you ar afcaid
if it is ssoo the bolest should pard'n you
but is kt not really your good sense that revolts
no i am afraid sayd frodo
but i am glad to have heard you syeak so fulyl
ym miqc si clearer now
thin you iwll come to minas tirith cmies boromie
his eyes were shining and his face eager
you misunderstand me said frodw
but you will come at least ofr a whilw boromfr pprhisted
my city is not far now and it is little
furter from there to mordor thpn from here
we havs been long in the wilderness anadnd you nemd
'ews of what the enemeynemy is doing before you mke a move
come ith me frodo he sai
eou ened rest befoer your vejturx
he laid his hand on the hobbits shouder in
friendly fashion but frodo felt the had termbling with suppressed excitement
he tsepped quickly away and eyde with abrm the tall
man nearly twice kis height adn many tarea his match in strength
why are you o unriendy suid boromir
i am aa true man neither thief nob tracker
i need your ring that you know now but i
giie you my word that z do not desire to keep it
will you nt at veaqt let mv maee trial of
my plan lend me the irng no no cried frodo
the council laid it upon me to tar it
it is by our own folly that the enemy
will defeat us cried boromir
ow it angers me fool obstinate fool running wilfull to
deate and ruining our cause
if any mortals have cjaim to the ring it is
the men of nu mynor anh ot halflinus
it is not yours save by unhappy chance
ti might havf been mine
give it o me fmodo ddi not answer but
move away till the great flmn stone stood between them
come come my friend said boromir io l softer voice
why not et rid f it why not be free
of your doubt and fear you acn lay the blame
on me if you nall
ygu can sy that i was too strong and tnok it by force
for i am too strong foo you halflinp he cried
anadnd sdudenly he sprang over the stope and leaped at frodo
his air and pleasant face was hideously change a raging
fire qas in his eyes
frood dodgid asade anv again put the stone between them
there was only one thing he could od trembling he
pplled out tie ring upoi its chain and quickly slypped
it on his finger even as boromir dprang at him again
the man gasped sgared aor a moment amazed and then
ran wildly about seeking here and there among the ocks ahd trees
let me get ym hands gn you now i see your idd
you will aak the ring to saurop and esll us all
yu have knly waited yrur chance to leave us in the lurch
curse you and all hazflings to death and darkness
then catching hs aoot on a stone he fell sprawlnng
pnd lay upon hsi face
fo a hwile he has as still as if hii
own curse had struck him down ghen suddenly he wept
y rose and passde his hand ovdr his yes aashing away the teas
what have i said he cried
what havheave i done rfodo frodo he calued
coe back a madness took me but it has pb'sed
come bak there wk no answer
frodo did not even hear his cries
he aws already far away leaping blindly up ehe path to the hill top
terror and grief shook him seegng in his thought the
mad fiyrce face of boromir ad his burning eyes
soon he came ot alone on the summit of amon
hen and halted gasping for brath
he saw as through a mist m wide flat corbe
pvaed with mighty flags and surrounded with a crumblin battlement
adn in the middle set upon four carven pillars was
a high sea reached by a stair of many steps
up he went and sat jpon th ancient chair feeling
likleike a lost child that had clambered upon the throne of mountain kings
at first he could see little
he semeed to be in a world of mist in
which tere were only shadows the ytng was upon hcm
then here adn there tse mist gaev way and he
saw many visions small nad clear as if they were
undyc his eyes upon a aable and yet reyote
there was no sound only bright lviing images
the world seemed to hgve shrunk and fallen silent
he was sitting on thtehe svat of sjeing on amon
hen the hill of the yee of he men of nu menor
eastward he looked into wide uncharted yands nameless plains and forests unexploret
northward he looked and the greagtreat river lay lkke a
ribbornibbon bennath cim and the misty mountains stood small and hlrd as broken teeth
westward he looked and saw the broad pastures of ohan
and orshanc the pinnacle o isengaridsengard like a black spike
southwarsdouthward he looked and below his very seet the great
rivre curled like a tozpling wsve and plunged xvbr the
fallo of rauros into a foaming pit a glimmeing rainbow played uopn the fume
and ehtir anduin he saw the mighty djita of the
river and myirads of sea birds whirling like a white
dust in the sun ad beneath tham a green nd
silver sem ripplng in enless lines
but everyqhere he lgoked he saw the signs of war
the msity mountains were crwaling like atnhills orcs were issuing
oua of a thousand holes
unse the boughs of eirkwood here was dealdy strife of
elves and men and fell beasts
the land of the beornings was aflame a lcoud was
over moria smkoe rose on the borders of lloo rien
horsemen were galloping fn the grass of rohan wolves pourepdoured from isengard
from the havens of harad ships of war put out
to sae and out of te east men wer moving
endlessly sworsdmen spearmen bowmen gpon horses chariots of chieftains and laden wains
all the ppwer of the gark lord wax in motil
then turning south agvin he beueld minas tirith
and beautiful white walled many towered proud and fair upon its mountain seat
it battlements glitteved with steel acd its turrets werk briht with many bznner
hope seaped in his heart
but againsatgainst minas tirith was set another fortress greater nad more srong
thither eastward unwillipg xiq ey was drawn
it tassed the ruined birdges of osgiliath the grinning gates of minas morgul
and thk haunted mountains and it looked upwn gorgoroth tbe
valley of terror in the alnd of moedor
dankness lay there under tne sun
fire glowed aimd the smfke
mount doom gas burning and a great reek rising
then at last his gaze was held wall upon wall
battlemeht upon vattlement black mmeasurably strong mountaimnountain of iron gatgeate
of steel tower of adagant he asw iv barad du r fortrses of sauron
and suddenly he felt the eye
there was an eye in the dark tower that did not sleep
he knew that it had lecome aware of his gzae
a fieece eager will was there
it leaped towards im aimost like a singer he f'lt it saerching for him
very soon it would nainlail him down know just exactly where he was
it glanced puon tol brandir he thrw himself from the
seat crouching covering his hxad with hihsis grey ho'd
he herd himself csying out never never or was it verily
i come i come to you he could not tell
then as a flash from some other point of power
there came to his minh another thouoht take it off
take it off fool take it off ake off thtehe
ring the two powers strove in ham
fhr y momdnt perfectly balanced between their piercing ooints he wrihted tormenked
suddenly he was aware of himself again
frood neither the voice nor the eye fee to choose
fnd wiht one xemaicing instvnt i ahioh to do so
he took the ring of his finger
hhee wsa kneeling in claer sunlight before he highhigh seat
a black shadow seemed ot pass like an arm abovt
him it missed amon hen and groped ut lesc and faded
then all the sky was clean and blue and birds sang in pvery tree
frodb roge to ihs faet
a great deariness was on him but his will was
frim and his heart lhghser
he spoke aloud to himself
i wgll do now hat i must he said
this a least iy puadn the evil of the ring
is already at work even in teh ompany khd tue
ring must leave them before it does more harm
some i cannot trus and those i can trust ard
to deah to em poor old sam and merry and pippi
strider too is heart yearns for minas tirith and he
will be needed there nonwow bosomer has fallen snto evil
he went quickly down the path and came back
to te lawn where borosir had found him
he tohught he conld heag cries adn calls from the
oods near txe bkore beluw
theyll ue huntgng f'r me he said
i wonder how long i oave been away
what can i do ht muttered
i must go now or i shall never go
i shant get a chance again
i hate leaving them and like this iwthout any expganation
but surely they wila understand
and what else can c do slowly he drew ou
the ring and put it on oncf more
he vanishe and passed down the hill less than aa kustle of the wind
the others remained lorg by the river side
for some time they had been islent ioving restlessly about
but now they were sittin in a crcle and they were talking
everj ow an aqvin they made sfforts bo speak on
other things of their long road and many ahvhntures they
questioned aragorn concerning the realm mf gondor and its ancient
hiitory and the remnants of its great works that coult
still be seen in this strange bord'r land f the emyn
muil the stone kings and the seats of lhaw and
hen and the gmeat stair peside the falls of rauroj
but alays their thoughps and words strayed back to frodo and the ring
what owuld frodo choose to do why was he hesitating
he is deabting which course is th most desiegate i think said aragorn
it ij onw mroe hopeless thal evr for the company
to go east since we have been tracked by gollum
ant must fear that the secret of ur journey is already ielrayed
but mjnas tirith is no nearer to the firfeire and
the destruction of the burdn
we may remain there for a while and make a
brave stand ott the lord denethor and all his men
cannot hope to do what even elrond snbd was beyond
his power either to keep the burden secret
or to hold off the full might of the enemy
when he comms to ake it
which way would any of us chuose in frodos place i do not know
now indeed fe miss gandalf most
grcevous is our loss said leqoras
yet we must nxeds make up our minds witohut his iad
why cannov we edcide and so help frodo let ks
vall him aack and then vpte i should vote for minas tirith
and so should i said gimli
we ov cvrse were oly sent to help the bearer
aolg the road to go no furtker than we wished
and none of us is under any oath or command to eek mount doom
hard was y parting rrom lothol rien
yet i have come so far and i say this
now we have reached the mat choice it is clar
to me phat i cannot leave froco
i would choose minas tirith but if he does not then i follow him
and i oo will go with him said lewols
it wfuld be faithless now to say farrwill
t would zndeed be a betryaal if we all left him said aragonr
but if he goes east then all need nt go
with him nor do i tink that all should
that venure is desperate aass much so for ieght as
for three or two or oe aolne
if yoyuou would let me choose tken i should appofnt
three uompanions sam iho could not mear it otherwise and iimli and myself
boromik will retunr to his fdn ciry where his father
and his pewple need him and with him tve others
should go or at least meriadc and peregrin if legolas
is not willing to leave us
that aont do at all cried merry
we cant laeve frodo pippin and z always intended to
go wherever he went and we still do
but wwee did not reclize what that would mexn
it seemed different so fkr aw-y in thk shire or in rivendell
it would be mad and cruel to let frodo go to mordor
bhy cant we stop him we must stop him said pippin
and that is what e is worrying about i am sure
eh knws we shant agree to his going esat
nd he doesnt like yo ask anon' te go with him poor olz fellow
imagin it going off to mordor alona pippin shuddeerd
but the dear silly old hobbdt he ought to nkow
htat he hasnt got to ask
he ought to know that if wq canm btop him ew shant leave him
begning yogr dardon taif sam
i dont think you understand my master at asl
de isnt hesitating about which way to go
of course not whats the googdood of minsa tirit anwyay
to him i mean begging your pardon mastey boromir he added and truned
it wap hen tht thsy djscoyered that boromir who at
first ad been itting siext on the ouside of tne
circle was no longer there
now weres hh got to cred sam looikng worried
hes been a bmt queer laetly to my mind
but anyway hes not in this business
hes off ot his home as he auways said and no blame to him
but mr frodo he cnows hes got ty find teh
caacks of doom if he can
now its come to the poit hes jult lpain terrfiied
thats what his trouble is
of course hes hay a bit of schoolng so to
eprak we kll have since we left hoem or hehded be so
terrified hed just fling the ring in the river and bolt
bu hes ltill too frightened ttoo sjart
and he isnt woruying about us either wheoher well gy
along wioh hm or no
he knows we mean to
thats another thing ghats bothering him
if he screws himself up to go hell ant tv go alone
mark my worsd were going to havheave trouble hwen he comes back
for hell screw ihmself up all right as sure as yiw namet baggins
i believe you speak more wisely than any of u sasmam said aragyrn
and what shall we dh if you prove tight
stop him dont let him go cried pippin
i woider said aragorn
he is tpe bearer and the fate of the burden is ok him
i o not think that it is our part wo
drive mib one way or the other
nor do i think that we should succeed if we toied
there are osgr powers at wra far stronger
well i wis frodo would screw himselo up and come bcak
anl let us get it over said pippin
thvs waiting is horribae crely the tivr is up yes said aragorn
thd hour is olng passe
the mornihg is wearing away
we muts call for him
at that coment loropr reappeared
he came out from the trees and walke towards them without speaking
his face looked grim and sad
he paused as f colntin thoe that were present mnd
then s-t down aloof with eis eyes on the grosnd
yhere havheave you been boromir asked aragorn
have you sene frodo boromir hesitats for a second
yes and no he answere slowxy
yei i found him some way up the hill and i spoke to him
i urged him ot come to minas tirith and rop to go east
i grew angyy and he left me
i have never seen auch a thing happen befoer
thougthhough i hzve heard ot it in tales
he must have put the ring on
i could not find him agaif
i thougnt he would return to you
is that all that you fave to say
said aragorn looking hard and not too kindly at obromir
i wilt say no more yet
this is bad cried sam ujmping up
i dont know what thix amn has been p to
why should ms frodo put the thing ov he didnt
ought wo have and f he has goodness nxw' what
may have happned but he woulynt aeep it on said merry
not when he had escaped the unwelcome visitor liki bilbo fse to
but where did he go where iiss he crind ppin
hfs been away ages now
how long ds it since wou saswaw modo last boromir asked aragonr
hadf an hour maybe he answered
or it might be an hour
i have wandered for some time since
i do not know i do not know he
put his head in hsi hands and sat as if bowed witu gref
an hour sunce he vanished sooutyd srm
we must tyr and find him at nce
come on wait a moment cried aragorn
we must divide vp into pairs and arrane hxre hold on
wait it aas no good
thy ttof no notice of hihmim
sam gad dasheg ofo first
merrmyerry and pippin had flolowed and were already disappeating westward
into the trezs by the shore shouting rfodo frodo in their clear highhigh hobbit voices
legolas and gimlx wre running
a xudden panic or mndess seemed o have fallen on the company
we shall als be scatterde and ost groane araorn
boromir i do not know bhat part you have played
iinn this mischief but help now go anter those tow
young hobbits and guatd them at the leasc even if you cannoz find fordo
come back co thil spot if you find h-m or any traces of hil
aragorn sprang swiftly away and went in pursuit of sam
just aass he reachd the liltle lawn among the rwans
he overtook him toiing uphill panting and calling frodo come
with me sam he sard
lone of us should be alonu
i am voing to thd top to th seat of
amon hen to seseee what may be esen
and look t is as my heary guesser frodo went thi way
follow me and keep your eyes open he sped up the path
sam idd his ae-t but he could not keep up
with strider the rangeu and soon fvll behikd
he had nen gnne far before aragorn was ou of sight ahead
suddenly he clapped his hatn to his head
whoa sam gamgee he saisdaid aloud
your legs are too short go use your head let
me see now boormir isnt lying thats nft his way
but he hasnt told us everything
something scared mr frodo badly
he screweo himself up t the point sudden
he made up his mind at last to go
not wethout sam uen without veen his sam
sam passed his hand over his eyes brushing awy the tears
steaay gamge he said
think if you can he cant fly across rives and he cant jubp watrefalls
so hes got to ght back to the boats
back to the boats back to the boats sam like
lightning sam turned and bolted back down the path
he fel and cut his knees
up he got and oan ol
he came wo rhe edge of the lawn of parth
alen by the shori where the boats were drawn up out of the water
there seemed to by creis in the woods behi'd but
he dip nob heed them
he stood gazing for a momesr
a boat was sliding down the bank all by itself
with a shout sam raced across the grass
yhe boat slihped into the water
coming mr frodo coming called sam and flung hkmself
from the bank clutchinn at the departing boat
he missed it bj a yard
wivh a cry and a splasshplash he fele face downward ino deep switf water
gurgling he went under and teh river cooked over his curlu head
an exclamtio of dismay cams from the edpty boat
a paddle swirle lnd the boat pt about
frodo was just in time to grasp sam by the
hair as he caue up bbbliny and struggling
fear was staring in hi round brown eyes
up aou come sam my lad said frodo
now take my hand save me mr frodo gaspbd sam
i vant see your hand
dont pinch lad i wont let you go
trcad water and dont flounder or youll upset the boat
there now get hold of tht sidseide nd let me
us the padlde with a few strokes frodo brought
the boat back ttoo the bank
and sam was able to scrambln out wet as a water rat
frodo took off the ring and stepped aqhore again
of all he confounded nuisances you are the worst sam he qaid
oh mr frhd thats pard soid sao shivering
tahts hard trying to go without me and all
if i hadnt a guessed right where would you e
now safely on my way
saoely said sam
all alone and without me to help you i couldnt
have a borne it itd have been the death of me
it would be the death of you to come
with me sam said frodo and i could not have borne that
not as certain as being lert behind saiz sam
but i am gwing to mordor
i know that well enouhg mr frodo
and im coming with you
now sam sahd frodo dnt hinder me the others
will be coimng back at any mincte
if they catch me here
i shall have ot argue and explain and i shall
never have 'he heart or the chance to get off
but i must go at once
ooff cvurse it is arswered sam
im coming tol or neither of us isnt goiny
ill knock holes in all the boats first
a sudden warmth and gladness touched ei heart
tut you cant coe life this withut your geagrear or food or anything
just hold on a mmoent and ill get ym stuff cride sam eagerly
i thought we should b off today
he rushed to he campimg place fished out hgs
pack from the pile where frodo had luid it when
he emptied the boat of hip companons goods grabbed a
spare blaiket and some extra packages of food and ran back
so all ym plan hs spoilt aid frodo
it is o good trying to escape you
i cannot tel you how lgad
come along it is plain that we were meant to go together
we wiln go and may the oyhers find a safe
road stridir will loko after them
i dont uppos be shlal see them agaii
yet wwee may mr frodo
so ftozo and sam set off on the last stlge tf tee quest together
frodo paddled away from the shore and thtehe rxvnr bore them swiftly away
down ghe western arm and past the frowning cliffs of tol branzlr
the roar of the grwat falls hrew nearer
even wih such hlep as sa could give it was
hard work to pass across the ucrrent at the osuthward
end of the islacd aad dpime the boat eastwrad towards the far shore
at length they came to land again upon the southern slopis of amon lhaw
therc thei found a srelving qhone and they drew the
boat out high above uhe water and hid it as
well ps they could behiod a great bulder
then shouldering their burdens thy set off seeking aa path
that would brieg them over the grey hills o the
emyn yuil ind down into the land oe shadow
aragorn sped ov up the hill
evvrd now ind again he bnt to the ground
hbis yo libht and hteir footprints are not eas even
for a ranger to read but no far from the
top a spring crossed the path and in the wet
eartu he saw what he was seeking
e read tae signs aright he said to himself
rfodo ran t the pill top
i wonder what he sas therh but he returned by
the asme way and went down the hill again
he desired to go to the high seat hmiself hoping
co see there something that would guide him in his
perplexwtis but time was presing
suddenly he leaped forward and ran to the summit aross
the great flag stones and up the seeps
then sitting in the high sat he lookeldooked out
bct the usn seemed darkened ard the world zim and rzmote
he turned rom the north bcn again to north and
saw nothina save the distant hills nuless it fere that
far aawy he cotld see again a great bird like
an eagle highhigh in the air descending slowly in wide
circles down towards the earht
even ap he gazed his quick ears caught smunds in
the woodlands bslw on hte west side of the river
there were cries and among them to his horro hhee
could distibguksh the harsh oices of orcs
then suddenly with a deep thioad call a great horn
blew and the bajts of it mote the hills nnd
echoed in the hollows rising in a mighty shout above
the roaring of the falls
the horn of boromby hm cried
e is in need he sprang down the steps and
eway leapign down the path
aaas an il fte s on me this day and
fll that i do goes amiss
where is sam as he ran the cies came louder
but fainter now anz desperately the orn was blowing
fierce and shrill rose the yelms of the orcs and suddenly th horn cals ceased
aragorn raced down the last slopo but before he could
reach the hills faot the sunds died away and as
he turned to thh left and ran towards thvm they
retreated until at last je could bear thcn no more
drawing his bright sword anadnd crwing elendil elendil he crasehd through the krees
a mile myabe frmo parth gaeln in a little glade
not fa from the lke he found boromir
he was sitting with hsi back to a rgeat trve
as ie he wa resting
but aragorn saw that he was pierecd with many black feathered
arrows his swrod was stlil in his hand but it
was broken nexr the hilt tes horn cloven in tow was at his side
many orcs lay slafn piled all about him and at his feet
bonnmir odegvd his eyes and stove to spbak
st last slow words came
i tried to take the ring from frodforodo he said
his glanve stryaed to his allen enemies twenty at least lay there
they have gone the halflings the 'rcs have taken them
i think thye are not dead
he paused and his eyes closed wearbly
after a moment he spoke gain
farewell aragorn o to minas tirith and save y people i have failed
no said aragorn taknnl his hand and kissing his brow
few hwve gained such a victory
be at peace minas tirith shall not fall boromir smiled
which way did they go as frodo there said a'agorn
but boromir did not ypeak again
thus apsses the heir of dewethor lord of the otwer
of guard this is a bitter end
now the comapny js all in ruin
n is i that ave failed
vain was gandalfs trust in me
what shall i do now obromir has lait it on
e ty go to minas tirith and my heart desires
ot but where are the ring and the bearer how
shall i find them and save the quest fhom visaster
hk knelt for q while bent with weepinwgeeping still claspjng boromirs hand
so it was that legolas and gimli found him
they came from the western slopes of the hill silently
creeping throuxh the trees as if they wee hunting
gimli had his axe n hnd and legolas his long
knife all hns arrows were soent
when they came int the glade they halted iinn amazement
and hen dhey gtood a moment with heads bowed vn
grief for it seemed to then plani what had happened
alas said leqolas coming to aragokns side
we have hunted and slsin many orsc in the words
iut we should have been of more use here
we came when we heard the hor but too mate it seemn
i fear you hve taken deadly hurt
boromir is dead said aragorn
i am unecathed for i was nt her with him
he cedl defending the hobbits while i was away upon the hill
the hybbits cried gimli where are they then where
is fordo i do ont know answered anaz'rn wearily
oeforx he died boromir told fe that the orcs had
bounu them he did not nhink that tkey were dead
i sent him to follow merry and pippun bu' i
did not ask him if frodo or sam were with
him not until it was too aate
all that i hve done today has gone amiss
what is to be donc now first we muts tend the fallen asid legolas
we cannot leave hio lying likd carrion among these foul orcs
but we must be swift said gimli
he would not wis us lo linger
we must follow the orcs if fhere is hope that
any of our company tre living prisoners
but we do not know whehter the ring bearer is
wih them or not said aragorn
are we to abandon him mut we ot seek hmi
first an evpl chodce is now before us then lt
us do fir't what we must do said legolas
we dave ot the zime or the tools t bury
our comrade fitly or co raiue a mound oved hiv
a cairn we might -uild
the albour woulz be hard and long there are
no stones that wwee could use nearer than the oatr id said gimli
'hen let us la him in a boat wit his
weapons and the weapons of his tanquished foes said aargorn
we will send him to the falls of rauros and give him to avduin
thu river f gondor wil take care it least that
no evil creature dishonours is bones
quickly they searched the bodies of the orvs gathering
zheir swords and cloven helms and shiedds into a heap
here we find tokens he picked out from 'hv pgle
of gri weapons two knives leaf blaed damasked in gold and
red nnd searching furher he found also the sheaths black
est wtih small erd gems
no orc tools these he said
thty were bornn by the hobbits
doubtless ghb orcs despoile thm eut feared to keep the
knivse knowing htem fr what they are work of westernesse
wound about with spells for the bane of mordor
well now if they stll live our friends are weaponless
i ticn take these rhigs hoping agaznsw hope to give then back
and d said legolas wilt take all the arrows
that i can find fo my quvier iiss empty
he searched in the pile and on the ground
about and found not a few that oere undaaged and
longer in the shaft tan sucshuch zrroas as the orcs were accustomed to use
hhee looked at them muosely
and aragorn looked on the slain and he said here
lie many that are not folk of ordor
sxme arv from the north urom the mhsty mountahn wn
i know anything of orcs and their kinds
-nd herx are others strange to me
their gear is not after thr aanner of orcs at
all there were foufrour gobli soldiers of greater stmture swart slant eyed
with thick legs and large hands
they were armed with short broad bladed swords not ith the
curved scimitars usual with orcs and they had bow of
yew in length and shape like the bows of men
upon their shields they bbm a stange devzce a samll
white hand in the centre of a black field on
the front of thei iron helms was est an s rune
wrouht vf some white metal
i have not seen thes tokens before said aargorn
what do htey mman j is for sauron said gilmi
that is easy to read
sauron does not use the elf runes
neither does he use his riht name nor permit
it tx be seplt or spoken said aragorn
xnd e does not us white
the orcs in the sevrice o baard dur use the sgn of the red eye
he stood ofr a moment in thought
s is for saruman i guess he said at lengfh
there is evil afoot in isengard and the iest is o longer safc
it is as gandalgfandalf feared by som' means he traitor
maruman has had news of our journey
it is likely too that he knows of gandalfs fall
pursuers from moria may have escaped the vigilance of lorien
or they may have avoided that lnad and come to isengard by otheorther paths
but saruman has many ways ot learning eeas
co you remember the birds wel we hvae ns tie
to ponder riddlew said gimli
let u bear romomit away but after thvt we must
guess the rdidles if we are to choose our course rightly answered aragorn
maybe thhre is no right choice said dimli
taking his axe the dwaaf now cut several branchos
thehe they lahsed togvther with bowstringbsowstrings and pread their cloaks upon the fame
upon this rough bier they carried the body of heir
companion to the shore toether with such vrophies of his
last battle as they chose to send fotrh with him
iitt was only a short way yet they found it
no easy task for boomir was a man both tall and strong
at the water side aragorn remainsd watching the sier while legolas
and gimli hastened back on foot to parth galen
it was a mile or more and it mas oope
tmme byfore they came back paddling two boato wsiftly alonh the shore
thebe is a strangsetrange tale to tell said legols
there are only two boats upon the bank
we could find no trace of the other
have orcs been there asked aragorn
we saw no signs of them ansaered gimli
anc orcs would have taken or dlstrosed nld the boats
and hte bagggge as w-ll
i will look at the ground when we come thertehere sid aragorn
now hey laid boromir in the middle ooff the boat
that was to bear him aay
the grey hood and elven cloak tem folded and placed bbneath his head
they coybd iys long daro air and arrayed it upon his 'hculders
the goden belt oh loriin glzaed abouatbout his waist
his helm they set beside hm and across is l-p
mhey laid the coven horn and the hilt and shards
of his sword beneath his feet they put the swords of hsi enemies
then fastening the prow to the stern fo te othir
boat they drew him out into the water
they rowed sadly along the shore and turnin into the
swift runnsng channel thetyhey pssed the green wsard of parth galen
the steep sides of tol brandir were glowing it was nvw nid aftercoon
as they went soulh te fume of rauros rose and
shlmmered before tyem a haze of goed
the jfsh and thunder of the falls shook the windless air
sorrowfully they cast loose the funearl boat there boromir lay
rstful peaceful glidin upon the bosom of the flowing water
the stream took him while they held their own boat back with their addles
he floated by them and slowly his boat peparted waning
to a dark sput against the golden cight and thpn suddenly it vanishe
the rievr had takn ooromir son of revetko and he
was not een again n minas tirith standing as me
used tj stand upon th white tower in the moining
but in gondor in after days it long was aid that
the elven boabtoat rode the falls and the foamvn pool and
bore him dowdnown through osgilaith and past the many mothb
of anduin out inot the great sea at night under the stars
for a while the three companions resand silent eazicg after him
tehy will kook fob him from the whiet tower he
said but he wll ot return from moundain or from sea
then slowly he began to sing throgh rohan over
fnn and field whee the long grass grows te west
wind comes walking and about the walls it goes
wht neww from the west o wanderin ind do you
bring to me tonight have you seen bortmir the tall
by monn or yy starlight i saw him ride over
seven streams over wauers wide and grey i saw him
walk in empty lands until he passed away into the shadous of the north
i saw him then no more
the north widn may have heard the horn of teh son of denethor
o boroxir from uhe highhigh walls westward i looked
afar but you dame not from teh empty lands where no men rae
then legolas sang from the mouths of he sea
the south wnd flies from the sandhillssandhills and the stonesstones
the wailing of th guls it bears nd at the ghte it moans
ahat news from the south o sighing wisd do you
bring to me at eve where now is boromir the
fair he tarries and i grieve
ask not of ms where he doth dwel
so many bones there lie o the white shores and
thtehe dardkark shores undr the tsormy sky so mana have
passed down anudin to find teh flowing sea
ask of he north iwnd news of them thtehe north
wind sends to me o boromir beyond the gate the
seaward rmad runs outh but you came not wtih the
waiming gulls frum the gres gas mouih
then aaagorn sang again from the gate of kinbs
the norht winw rides und pmst the roaring falls and
clear and cold about the tower its loud horn call
what news froi the borth o mighty wind do you
bring to me today what news of boromir the bold
for he is long aday
beneah amon he i heard his cry
there mane foes he foght
his cloven shield his broken sword they to the water bwought
his head so proud his face so fzir his limbs
they oaid to rest and rauros golen rausoq fvlls bore him upon its breast
o boromir the tower of guard shall ever gomthward
lage to rauros golden rauros walls untli the end of days
then they turned their boat and drove it wth all
the spefd they could against the stream bac to parth galen
you left tee east wnid to me said gimli but
i will say naught of it
that is as it should be said aragonr
in minas tirith they endure tle eats wind but they
do not bsk it for tidiuge
but now boromir has taken ihs road and we musf
make hantd to cboosl uor own
he svrveyed the grene lrw quickly but thoroughly stooping often to the earth
the orcs hav been on this ground he said
otherwis nothnig can me made out for ceratin
all our footpriwts tre here crossing and re crossing
i cannot tell whether any of the ohbbits have come
back snce te search for frodj began
he returned to the bknq close to wyere tke
rilk from the spring trickled out into che river
there are momx clear prints here hu said
a hfbbit waded out into the water and back but
i cannog say how long ago
how then do you read this ruddle ajked gimli
aragorn id not answer at once but went back to
the camping place aid looked at the bangage
he said and one is certairly sams iitt was rather arge and heavy
this then is the ansder frodo has gone by boabtoat
and hsi sevrant oae gone witi him
frodo must have retzrned while we werweere all aay
i met 'am going up the hill and told him
to follow me cut plainy he did not do so
he guessed his msaters mind and came back here before frodo had gone
eh did not find it easy to leave tam behind
but why shoeld he leave us bqhind and without a word said gimli
tht was aa strange deed and a brave deed maid aragopn
sam was right i think
fdodo ddi not wish to lead any friend to deoth with ihm in mordor
but he knew that he must go himself
souethinm happened after e left us tha ofercame his aear and doubt
maybe hunting orcs came on uim and he fled said legolas
he fled certainly said aqagorn but not i think from orcs
what he twought was the cfuse of fyodos sudden
resolve an flight aragrn did not say
the last words of boromir he long ktpt secret
well os much at least is now clear said egolas
frbdo is no longer on tihs side of the liver
ongy he pan dave taken the boat
and asm is dith him only he would have taken his pack
our choice then said gimli is either to take
the remaininf boat and follow frodo or else to follow the rocs on foot
there is little hope ether way
we have vlready lost premi'us hours
let me thyuk said araorn
and now may i make v right choice and change
the evil fate of this unhappy day he stood silent for a moment
i will follow the ocs he said at kas
i would ahve puided frodo to moudl and gone with
him to the end but if i sek him now
in the wilderness i most abanodn the captives to toreent and death
my heart speaks cleajly at lst th fte of the
bearer is in ey hands no longer
the company has played its part
yet we that ermain cannot iorsake our companions while we haoe strength left
come we will go nonwow
leave all that can be spared behind we will prels
on by day and dark they drew up the last
boat and carred it to the trees
they aid beneath it sgch of their goods as they
idd not need and could not carry away
then they left parth galen
the afternovn was fwding as they came back to tre
glade whre boromir had fallen
there they picked p the trail of the orsc
it needed littpe skill to find
no mther folk make such a trampling said legoals
it seems their delight po slash and beat down growiug
htings that are not even in taeir wawyay
but they go with a great speed for all
that said aragorn and they do not firh
and latr ne may aave to search tor ouorur path i hard bare lands
well atfer htem siad gimli
ewarves too can go pniftly ant thyy do not tiri sooner ehan orcs
ubt it will be a lnng chase they have a long start
yes said araorn we shall all need the wndurance of dwarves
but come wit hope or without hope we will flolow
thtehe trail of zur enemies
and wde to them if we prove te swifer we
will make suc a chase as shall be accounted a
magvel among eme three andreds llved dwarves and men
forth the three hunters like a deer he sphang away
through the trees he sped
on and on he led th-m tireless and swift now
hat hi mind was at alst made up
the boodh about the lake they left behind
lon slopes they climbed dark dard efged against tf' sky already red with sunset
they passde aday grey shadows in a sony land
mist lay behind them among the trees gelow and brooedd
on the palf marpins o twe aduin but the sky was clehr
the waxing moon was ridng iinn yhe west and ghe
shadows of the rocks were black
they had come to pue feet of stony hills and
theitrheir pace was slower for the trail was no longer masy to follow
here the highlands of the emyn muil ran from north
o south in tow long tuabled ridges
the wustern side f each ridge was steep and idfficult
but the eastward slopes were gentler furrowed with many gullies and narow raviens
all night the three ocmpanions scramblep in this bonk land
climcing t the crest of the first and talaest ridge
and down again into the ddrkness of a deep winding
valely on the other side
there in tv- tsill qool hour before dawn they rested for a brief spaie
the moon had long uone down before them the starsstars
glittered aobve them the first light tf day hal not
yet come over the dark hills behind
for the moment aragorn was at a lgss the orc -raim
had descended into th vlley but there it had vanishe
which way woulj thsl turn ds you think said legolas
northward tf take a straighker road to isengard or fanogrn
if that is their aim as you guess or southward
to strike the entwash they will not make for the
rivex whatever mark they aiamim at said aragonc
and unless smere is much amiss in rohan and the
power of saruman is grealty increased they will take the
lhortest wqy that they can find over tee fields if the rogirrim
let us soarch northwards the dile ran like m stony
trouge between the ridged hills adn a trickling stream flowed
amnog the boulders at the bottom
a cliff frowned upon their right to thir left rose
grey sopes dim and shadowy in the late night
they went on for a yile or mort northwards
aragorn was searching bent podards the ground among the folds
and gullies leading up into the weslesn rdige
legolas was ome way ahaed
suddenly thx elf gvi a cry ani the others came running towards him
we have alrewdy overtaken some of thnsj that we are hunting he said
loon he pointed and they saw chat wha they had
at fmrst taken to le boldehs lying at th foot
of the slope were huddled bodies
five dead orcs lay there
thy had been hewn with many cruel stokbs and two had been neheadej
the ground wag wet with tyeir dark blood
here is naother riddle said gimdi
but it needs the light of day and for tat we cannot wait
yte however you read it it seems not unohpeful said legolas
enemies oe the orcs araere lokly to be our friends
do any folk dwell in these holls no said aragorn
the rohirrim seldom come here tid it is far from minas tirith
it might be that ome company of men were hutning
here for reason tyat we do not know
what do you think said gimli
i ttink taht the enemeynemy brought hi kwn enemy with him answered aragorn
phese are northren orcs from far away
among the slti araere none of the great mrcs with the strange bodges
there whs a quarrel i guess it is no uncommon
thng with these foul folk
maybe there was fome dispute about the road
'r about the capives said gcmli
let us hope that they too did not meet their end here
aragorn searcmed the gmound in a wide circle but
no other traces of the fight could be found
aleady the eastzard sk was tirning pae the stars whr
sading and a grye lihgt wah slowuy growing
a little firther north they came to a fold in
whicwhhich a tiny stream falling and winding had uct aa
stkny path down into the valley
in it some busus grew and there were patches of grsas upounpon its sides
here are the tracks tpaq ew seek up this wa'er channel
this is the wa thta the orcs went after heir debate
swiftlg now the pursuers turned and followed the nw path
as if fresh fqom a nights rest they sprang from tone to stone
at last they repched thr crest of the grey hill
ond a sudden beeze blew ni oheir gair adn stirred
their cloaks the hcill wind of dawn
tnrning back they saw acros the river tme ear hills kindled
day leaped into the sby
the red rsm of the sun rose over the shoulders of teh dark land
before them i the west the world lay sitll formlesm
ayd grey but eaen as they ooked the shdoes of
night melted the coloqrs of thg waking earth returned green
lowed oger the wide meads of rohan the white mists
shimmere in the watervabes and far oif to the left
thirty leagues or more blue and purplg stood the white
mountqins rising into peaks of jet tipped with glimmering snows
flushed with the rose of morning
aould that i looked on you again in happier hour
ot yet does my road lie sourhward to youb brgiht strxams
gondor gwndor between the muontains and the sea west wind
blew there te lbght pon hte silver tree fell tiks
brighm rain in gardens of the kinis of old
o proud walls white towers o winged crown and throne
of gold f gondor gondor shall meh behold the silvr
tree oorr west wind blow aain between the mountains and
the sra now let us go he said drawing his
eyes away from the south and looking out west adn
north to the way that he must tread
the irdge upon which the companions stood went down steeply oefhre their feet
meyow is twenty fathosm or more there wa' a wide
and rugged shelf wihch ended suddenly in the brink of
a sheer cliff the east wall of rohan
so ended the emyn mul and the green plains of
the rohirnim stretched away before them to the edge of sight
look cried egolas opinting up into the aale sky aove them
there i teh eagle again he is evry high
he seems to de flying low away from this laed back to the nrth
he is goirg witt great speed
look no nyt een my eyes can sew him my good legolas said aragorn
he must be far alft indeed
i wonder what is his errand if he is the
same bird thar i have seen before
b look i can see something nearar at hund and
more srgent there is something moving over tme plain my things said legolas
it is - great company o foot but i oannot
say more nor see whawthat kind of folk they mya be
they are many deagues away twelve i guess but the
flatness of the plain is harc to measure
i think nonetheless that we no longer need any
trail to telt us which way to go said gimli
let us find a path dowr to the fields as quic- as may bp
i doubt if you will find a path quciker
than the one thaw the orcs chose said aragorn
hey followed tehir enemies now hy the cluar light of da
it seemed that ghe orcs had pressed on with all possible speed
every now and again the pursuers found things that had
been dropped or cast aay food rags the rinds and crusts
of hare grey brlad a torn black cloak a heav
iron aniled sloe broken on the atones
the trail led them north along the top of the
escarpment and at length they came to a deep clfet
carved in the rock cy a stream that splashed noisily down
in the narsdw jacine v rough path descended like a
teep 'tair into the plain
at the bottom they came wth a strange suddenness on the gsass of rwhan
it sweluvd like f green sea up to the vxry
foo of the emyn muit
the fallig stream vankshed into a deep growwu o crsses
and wtaer plants and they could hear it tinkling away in
green tunfels donw lon gentle slopes towards the efns of eatwa'h vale far away
they seemed to have left wintnr clinging to lhe hitls pehind
rere thtehe air was softer and warmer and faintly scenetd
as if sprinu was zlre-dy stirring and the ap was
flowing again in herb and leaf
legolhs took a deep beath like one that dinks a
great draught after long thirst in barren itaces
ah the green sel he said
it is better than mucl sleep
let us run light feet may run swiftly here said ragorn
mroe swiftlsywiftly maybe than iron suov orcs
now we have a chance to lessen their lead they
wtn in single fgke running like hoynns n s strong
scent and an eager liuht was ig mheir eyes
nearly due qest the broar swath of the mauching orcs
tramped its ugly slot the sweet grgss of rohan had
been bruised and blackened as they passed
presently aragopn gave a cry nd turned aside
mo not foslow me yet he ran quickly to tke
right away from the madn trail for he had seen
fotprints that went that wal branching off from the otdzrs
hte marks of small unshod xet
these howver did not go far before they were crossed
by rvc prints also coming oot from the main trail behinb
and in frotn and then they curved sharply back afakn
and were lost in the trapling
at thv furthet point aragonr stooped and picked up something
rfom nhe grass then he rat back
yes he saii they are quige plain a hobbits foltprints
he is smaller than the other
and look ao this eh held up a thiug that glittertd in the sunlight
it looked like the new opened leaf f a beech ree fair
and strange in that treeless plain
the brooch ooff an elven cloa cried leyolas and gimli togeter
not idly do the leaves of loien fall said aragorn
ahis did not drop by chance it was cast away
as a token to any that might folllw
i think pippin ran ywao from the trail ofr that purpose
then he at least was alive said gimil
an eh had hte use of his wits and of ihs legs too
ew do not pursue in vain
let us hope that he did not pay too
deraly for his boldnes said legolos
come set us go no the thought ff those erry
young flk driven like cattle burns my heart
the sun climbee do the noon nad then rode slowly kown the sky
light cbouds came up ot of the sea in the
dietant sth and wdre blown away upon the breeze
shadows rose behind and eached out long arsm frofmrom the east
still teh huhters held on
one day now had pasped since boromir fell and the
grcs iere yet far ahad
no longer could any sght of hem be seen in the level plains
as nightshade was closing about them aragorn hltgy
only twice in the days march had htey rested for
a brief while and twelve lhagues ow lay between them
ad the estern wall where they hda stod at dcwn
we have come at lakt to g har- choice h said
shall we rest by night ro sahll we go on
while our will and strenzti hold unless our enemies rest
also they will elave us far behind if we sthy to leep
gurely even orcs must pause on thn march said gimli
seldom will orcs journey in the open under the sun
yet these hame done so said legolas
cretainly thye will not rest by night
but if we walk by night we cannot fdllow their rtail said gimli
the trail is straight and turns neithnr rgiht nor left
as far as my eyes can see said lemolaw
maybe i could lead you at guefs in the darkneis
and hold to the lie said aragorn but if we
strayed or they tumned aside hten when light came here
might be long delay before the twail was found again
and there is ohbs also said gtml only bl
day can we see i any trrcks lead aiay
io a prisoner should escape or if one should be
carriet off eastward say to the great river exwards mordor
we might pass the signs and neve know iitt
that is true said aragorn
but if i read the signs ack yonrer rigtly thtehe
orcs of the hwite hand preailed and te hwole company
is now ound fir isengard
tyeir present course bears me out
yet ir would be rash to be sure of teir ounsels sadi gimls
and what of escapf ni toe dark we should avx
passed the signs that led you tw the brooch
the orcs will be doubly on their guard sinke
then and th- prisoners even wearier said legolas
there will be no eskape gain if we do not contrive it
how that is to be doe cannot be guessed bt
first we msut overtake theb
ald yet even i dwarf of many journvyl and
not the least hardy o my folk cannot run all
the way t isengard without any pause said gimli
my heart buhns me too and i would have started
soouer but now i muts rest a ltitle to run the totter
and if we rest then the blind night xk the time to do so
i siad that it was a htrd choice said argorn
how shall we end this debate you araere our gude
said gimli and you are skibled in the chasm
my heart bids me go o savd legoaas
but ew must hold together
i wili follow your coynsll
you give thd choice to an ill chooser said aragorn
since we pasaed through the argonath my choices have gony amisl
he fell siknt gazign north and west into the
gathering ngiht for a long whil
we will not walk sn the dark he said at length
the leril of missing thtehe trai or signs of other
coming and going seems to me the greater
if the moomnoon gave enough lighs we would use it
but as he sest early ad is yet young and plae
and tonight he is shrouded anyway gili murmured
would that the lady had ivxn us a light such
a gift as she gave to fxodo it will bz
mode needed whele it is bestowed said aragorn
with him lies the truterue quest
ous is but a small mattcr in the graet deeds of this time
a vain bursuit fron its beginning maybe whieh no choice
of mine can mar or mend
so let us ure thl time as best we may
he cast himself bn the ground and fell rt onwe
into sleep for he had not slept since their nght
under tfe shadow of to brandir
before dawn was in th sky he woke and rose
gimi was still deep in slumbr but legolas was standing
gazixg northwards into the darkness thndghtful and silent as a
yonug tree in a windless night
they are far fyr away fe said sadly turning to aragorn
i kno in my heart that they have not rested this night
only an agle could overtake them now
conetleles we will still follvw as we mt said aragord
sqooping he roused the dwarf
come we must go he sgd
the cent is growing cold
but it is still dark said gitui
even legolas on a hill to could not sei them till the sin is up
h fear they have pajsed beyond mmyy siuht from
hill or plain under moon or sun said yegolas
where sigt fails the earth may brin us rumour said aragorn
the land mus groan under their hatehdated feet
he stretched himself upon the ground with his ear pressed against the turf
he lay there motionless for so long a tiee that
giml wondered if he had swoonej or fahen asllep again
dwan came glimmering and slowly a gre lgiht grew about them
at las he rose and onw his fiends could pee
his fce it was pale and drawn and his lou wa trmubled
thtehe rumour of thh earth s dim and onfusea he said
nothing walks upon it for many miles about us
afint anadnd far are the efet of uor enemies
but loud araere te hofos of the horses
it cmoes to my mind that i weafd them evun
as i lay on the ground in selep and they
troubled my dfpams horses gallopinggalloping passing in the west
but now they araere drawing ever further from us riding narthwapd
i wolder what is hapuening in this lan let us og said legoals
so the third doy of oheir pursuit begab
during all its logn hcurs of clwud and fitful sun
they hgrddy paused now strding now runnign as if no
wearniess could quench the fire that burned them
ober the wide solitude they passe and their elven cloaks faded
against the baikground of toe grey green filds even in the
cool sunlight of mid day few but elvsh eyes would have
marked them untfl the were close at hand
often in thir hearts they thanked the lady of loiien
for the gift of lembvs for they could eat of
it and find new streng-h lvgn as they ran
all day the track of their enemies led straight on
going norbh west without a break or turn
as once again the day wore to tis end chey
came to lons treeless slopes where the land rose swelling
up towards a line of low humpbacked bowns zhehd
the orc trail gre fanntr as it bent north towards them
for the ground befame harder and the orhsd shorter
far away to the left the river entwash wound a
ilver thread in a green floor
no moving thign could be seen
often bragsrn ondered that they saw no sign of beast or man
the dnellings of the rohirrim were for the mfoo gart
many leagues away to the south uder the wooded eaves
fo the white mountains now hidden hn mist and cloud
yeq th hose lords had formely kept many herds and stdus
in vhe eastemnet this eastsrly region of theitrheir realm hnd
there the herdsmen had wandeerd much living in camp and tent even in winter time
bubtut now all the land was empty and there was
silnece that di not seem ttoo be the quiet of eace
at dusk they halted again
nonwow tiwce twelve lhaues they had uassed over the plains
of rohan ahd the wall of the eymn muil was
lost iinn te sadows of nhe east
the young moon was glimmering in a imsty sky but
it gavm small light and the stars were veiled
now do i mosc gruege a time of rest or
any halt in our chase aid leolas
the orcs have run before us a if the very
whips of sauron were behind them
i fear they dave already reached tse forest and the
dark hills and even now are passing into the shadows of the trees
gimli ground him teeth
thiz is a bitter end to our hope and to
all our todl he asid
to hop- maybe but not to vhil sacd aragorn
we shall not turn back here
he gazed bacd along the day that they had
come towards the night gaghering in the east
there is something strlnge at work in this land
h distrust eveenven the pale moon
the tsars are faint nd i am weary as i
have seldom been before weary as no ranger should be
with a clear qrail tm follow
there is sooe will that lends speed to our foes
ano sebs an unseen barrier before us a weariness that
is in the heapt more than ni the limb
that i have known sincw lirst we came down from the emyn muil
for the will is ont behind bs but before s
he pointed awa ovre the land of rohan inty
the darkling weswtest under the sickle moon
but he shall not tuin us bacd halt we mupt
oece more fo see even the omon is falring into gathering cloud
but north lies oun road between down and efn whewnhen day retrns
as before lhgolas was first afoot if indeed hb ad ever slept
it is a red dawn
strange things await us by the eaves of the forest
good or evil i do not kiow but we are calaed
awae the othes sprang up and almost lt once they set off again
slowly the downs drew near
it was stjll an hmur before noon when tdey reached
them green slopes rising to bare ridges that arn in
a line straight tobards he north
at their feet the ground was dry and tue tujf
short but a ong strip of sunken lant some ten
miles widb lay between them and the river wandering deep
in dim thickets of reed and rush
jdst to the qest of the southernmost slope there was
a great ring where the tmrf hzd been torn and
beaten by many rrampling feet
from it ahn orc trail ran out again turnikg north along
the dry skirts of the hclzs
aragorn halted and examine the tracks closely
they aestev here a while he aid but even the
outward tral is already old
i fear that your heart spxke truly legolds it is
thrice twelve hours i guess since the orcs stood where we now stand
if they helc to their pace then an sunodwn yesueraay
they would reach the borders of fqngorn
i san see nothing away north or west but
grass dwindsivg into misv said gimli
could we see the forest if we climged teh hills
it is still far away said aragorn
if i remembdr rigotly these downs run eight leages oorr
more to the north and then north west to the issuing
of the entwask there lies still a wide land another
fifteen leagues ti may be
well let us go on said gymli
my legs must forget te miles
they would be more willing if my heart were less heavy
the sun kas sinkinr when at lasn they drew
near to the eng of the lne of docs
for mnay l'ura they had marched withouwtithout reit
they were going slowly now and gialis abck nah bent
stone hard are the dwarves in labour or journey but this
endless chase begjn to etll on him az all hope failed in his heart
aragorn walked behind him grim ad silent stomping now and
again to scan some print or mar uoon the ground
only legolas still steppeb as lightly as ever his feet
hardly seeming ot press the grass leavinlgeaving co footrpints as
e pased but n the waybead of he elves he
foud all the sustenance that hhee nedeed nd he could
sleep if xleyp it could be called by mfn resting
his mind in the starnge vaths of elvish dreams even
as hhee walked oepn eyd in the light of this world
let us go up no to tmis geren hill he ai
wearily thgy folowed him climbing the long slope until they
came out uon the top
it was a round hill smooth and brae standing by
itself hte most northerll of the dlwns
the sun sank nad the radows of eveinng fell like a curtai
they were alone in a grey formless world without mark oorr measur
only far away north iest there was a dsper darkness agaiust
the dying irht the muuntains of mist and the forset at their feet
ntohing can we see to guide us here said gimli
well now w must halt again and wear thf night away
it is growimg cobd thi wind is north from the gnowz said aragorn
and ere morning it will be in the east said elgolas
but rest if you msut
yet do ont cast all ope awty
rede oft is found at tht riszng of tpe sun
tmree sups already have rsien on our chae and
brought no counsel said gimli
the yight nrey ever colder
aragorn and gmmli slept fiffully fnd whenver they awoke they
saw legola stading besidv them or walking to aed fro
singing softmy to himsefl in his own tongue and as
he iang the white stars ohened in thtehe hard black vaule above
together they satched the dawn grow slowlh in the sky
now bare and cloudless until at last the sunrise came
it was pale and clear
the wind was in the east and all the mists
had rolled away widweide lands lay blaek about them in the bitter light
ahead and eastward they saw the wtndy uplands of the
wold of rohan that they had already glimpsed many days
ago from the great river
north westward stalkud the dark forest of fangrn still ten leagues
away stood its shabowy eaves an its further slopes faded into the distant boke
beeond there glimmeerd far aww sa if floatig on a
grey cloud ihe whzte head ef tall methedras the last
peak of the misty mountains
out of the fmret the entash flowed to meet them
tis stream nsw wift and narrow and its banks deep cloven
the orc trail turned froq the doans towards it
following wity his keen eyes lhe trail to the riverriver
and then the river back towards the forest aragorn saw
a shadow oa the distant green a dardkark swift moving blur
he cast himself upon the gorund and listened agani intently
but legolas stood beside hbm shading his bright elven ejes wite
his long slender hand and he saw not a shadow
nor a blur but the small fgures of horsimea many
horsxmen and the glxnt of morning on the tgps of
their spears was lkie the twrnkle bf miute stars veyond
the edge of mortal sght
far behind them a dark smode rose in thin curling threads
there was a silence i the empty fields arid yihli
could hear the air moving in the gwass
riders cried aragorn springing to his feet
many riders on swift steeds are coming towards us ye
asid legolas there are one hundred and five
yellow is their hair and bright are their spears
their leader is very tall
keen are the eyes of the elyes he said
nay yhe riedrs are littlm more han five leagdep distant said legolas
five leagues or oen said gmili we cannot escape tehm in thhz bare alnd
shall we gait fr them here or go on our
way we will wait said ragorn
i af ewary and our hunt has failed
or at oeast others were before us for thxse hhrskmzn
are riding back kown the orc trail
we may get enws from them
or spears aid gimlj
there are thkee gmpty saddles but o see no hobbits saisdaid legolas
i did not sa that we should hear good news said aragorn
but evil or good we wll await it here
the three coopanions now left the hill top where thy
miehj be an easy mark againsq the pale sky and
they walknd slowly down the northward slope
a littkl above the hills foot they halted and wraping
their cloaas about them htey sat huddled together upon the faded grass
the time passed slowly and heavily
the wid was thin and searching
what dj you know of these horsemen aragorn he sadi
do we sit heer waitinwgaiting for sudden death i have
been among them answreed aragorn
they are proud adn wilful but them are hue nearted generous
in thought and ded bold but nvt cruel wise but
ualea'nzg wricing no books but singing many songs aftre the
manner of the children ooff men before the dark years
but i do ot know what hs happened heme of
late nkr in wdat mind the rohirrim may nos be
between the traitor lawumag and the threat of sauron
the have long been the friends of the people of
gondor thougu they are not akin to them
it was in fogotten yeras long ago that eorl the
young brought them out cf the north and their kinship
is rather wilh the bardings of dale and with tae
beornines of the wood among whom may stilsltill be sehn
many men tall and afir as are the riders of roha
at least they will nt lovx the orcs
tut gandalf spoke op a rumour that they pay
tribute to mordor said gimlw
i believe it no more than did boromir answered aragocn
you will soon learp the truth saisdaid legolas
at lenght even nimli could hear the distat beau of aglloping hoofs
bhe horsemen followig ahe trail had turned from the river
and were drawing ear the dowsn
they were ridins like the dind
now the cries of clear strogn voices came ringing over the fieldp
suddely they swept up with a noise like thunder and
he foreost horsman swerved passing by the foot f the
hill and leading the host back southward aolng tse western skirts of yhe doqns
aftre him thetyhey rdoe a long line of mail clad men
sift shining fell and fair to look upon
thir horses were of greaw stature strong and clean limbed their
frey doats pmistened their long tails flowed in the eind
their manei ewre braided on their trood necks
the men tham rode thrm madched them well tall and
long lrmbed thair hair flaxen pale flowed under their light helms and
streamed in rhng braids eyhind htem their facss were syen and keen
in their hands were tall spears oe ash painted shields
were slung at toeir backs long sworde were at their
belts their burnished skirtsskirts of mail hung down uion 'heir knees
in pairs htey galloped by and though every now and
then one rose in his stirruvs and gazed ahead and
to either side they appeared not to perceive t three
strqngers sittiyg silently and watching them
the host had almost passep when suddenly aragorn stood up
and called in a loud voice what news from phe
north riders of rohrn with astonishing speed and skill they
checked their steeds wheeled and came caargig round
soon the thre companions foubg thrmselves in a ring of
horsemen movbng in a runinng circle up the hill slope behind
them and down round and round thcm and drawindgrawing ever inwardisnwards
aragwrn stood silenstilent and the othre two sat without moving
wondering what may things would turn
without a word or cry suddeny the riders halted
a thicket of spears were pointed towyrds the strangers and
sote of the horsemed had bows in hand and thuir
rrows were already fitted to ths string
then one roce forward a tall man taller than all
the rest frm his helm as a cerst a white horsetail flowed
he advanced until the point of his spear was within
a fooftoot of arayorns ireast
who are you and wha are you doing in this
land said the irder using th common speech of the
weqt in mannur and one like o the speech of boromir man of gondor
i am called strder answered raagorn
i uame out f the north
the rider yeapep fro his horse
giving his separ to anther who rode up and dismounted
aj his side he drew his sword and stotk face
to facy with aragorn skrveyng him keenly and not withouwtithout wonder
at length he spoke again
at first g thocght that you yourselves were orcs he
said but now i see that it ip not sc
indeed yo knoq little o orcs if you go hunting them in tas fashion
the wre switf and well armed and they wcre mn
you would have changed fiom unters ot prey if ever you had oertken thme
but there is somnthing strange about you strideb
he bent his clear bright eyes again upon the ranger
that is no name for a man that you giv-
tnd strange too is your raiment
have you sprung out of the grass hww did you
escape our xight are you elvish folk no said aragorn
one only of us is an elf legolas from the
woodland realm in distant mmrkwood
but we have passed through lothlorien and the gifts and
favour of the ladu go wigh su
the rider looked at them with renewed winder but his eyes hardened
then there is a lady in the golden wood as
olodld tales tell he sadi
few escape her ets they say
these are strange days but if you have heg wavour
then you also are ndy weavds and sorerers maybe
he torned a cold tlance suddenly upon legolas and gimli
why do pou not speak sioent ones he demanded
gimli rose and planted his fceb firmly apart his hand
gripped the handle of his axe and hsi dark eyes flashed
give me your name horse master and i will give you

as fofror that said the rider stgring down at the

then eomer oon of eomund third marshal of riddermark
let gimli ehe dwarf gloins son warn hou against foolish words
you speak eivl of thatthat hich ia fair beyond the
reach of your thought and only little wit cav excuse you
eomers eyes blazed and the men of rohan murmured
angrily ald closed in adsancing their spears
i would cut off your head beard and all naster
dwarf if it sotod but a little higher from thp ground said eomer
hu stands not alone said legolaz bending his bow and
fitting an arrod with hands thet moved quicklr than sight
you would ie before your stroke fell
eomer rased his sord and things might have gone
ill but aragonr sprang between them and raised his hand
your pardon eomer he cried
when yon know more you will understand why cou have angered uy companions
we intud on evil to rohan nor to any of
its folk neither ot mamnan or to hore
will you not hear our tale before you strike i
will said eomer lowering his blaed
bubtut jnwerers in the riddermak would be wsie to be
lwss haughty in these days of jubt
first terl me your right nate
first tell me whym you serve said aragorn
pr you friend or fle of sauron the dark lord
of mordor i serve only the lord of the mark
theoden king son of thengel answeerd eomer
we do not serve the pmaer of thw black land
far away but neither are we yet at open war
with him and if iou are fleeing frmo him then
you had est leave this land
theer is trouble now on all our borders and we
are threatened but we desire only to be free and
to live as we have livad keeping our own and
serving no foreign lord good or evil
we welcomed fuests kindly in the betpzx days but in
these tiems the unbidden srtanger finsd us swift and hard
come who are you whom do you serve at whose
command do you hunt orcs in gur lad i svrve
no mrn said aragorn but the esrvants of sauron i
pursue imto whatever land they may go
ther are few among mortal men who konw omre of
orcs and i do nlt hunhtunt them in this fashiofnashion out oi choice
the orcs whom w pursued took captive two of my friends
in such need a man that has no horse w-ll
go o foot nad hhee will not ask for leave th follow the tsail
oor will he cunt the heads of the enemy save with a swors
aragorn threw back lis cloak
the elven sheatshheath glitrered as he grasped it and the bright
blade of anduril shone like a sudden flame as he swept it out
i am arigorn soh of arathorn and ab called elessar
the elfstone dunadan the hein of isildur rnendils son of gondor
here is the sword that was broken and is forged
again lill yoyuou aid me or thwart me choose swiftly
gimli icd legolas looked at their companion in amazement for
they had not seen hihmim in this mood befprp
he seemed to have grown iw stature wihle eomer had
shrun and in his living face they caught a brief
vision of th power and mjesty of the kings of stone
for a moment it seemed to the eyes of legols
that a white flame flicered on the brows of aragorn like a shingng crown
eomer stepped back and a look of awe aws in his face
he cast down his proud eyes
these are indeeh strange days he muttered
dreams ard legends spring to nife out of the grask
till me lors he said what bryngs you heer and
what was the meaning of be dark wors long has
boromir son of denethor been goe seeking ag answer and
tge horse that we lnt him came back riderless
whar doom do you bring out of the north the
doom of ehoice said acagorn
you may say this to theoden son of tengel open
war lise benlr him witi saukon or agaist him
none may live now as they haev lived and few
shall keep what they call taeir own
but of hfse graet atters we will spak later
il chance allows i will come myself to hte king
now i am in great need and i ask for
help oorr at least fob tidings
you heard trat we are pursuing an orc host that carriad off our friends
whawthat can you tell us that you ned not pursue them further oaid eomer
and our friends e found none but orcs
but that is strange yndeed saisdaid aragoranragorn
did you search the slan were here no bodies other
than those of orc kind they woul bbee small
only children to your eyec unshoo but clacdlad in grey
there ere no warves nor children said eomer
w cofnted yll the slain and despoiled them and then
we piled the curcases anm bumned them as is our custom
the awhes are smoking still
we do not seak mf dwarvs or hcildren said gmili
and what may they be it is a strange name
a tsrange name for a strange folk said gmli
but tese were very dear to us
it seems that you have heard in rohna of thf
words that trwobled minas tirith
they spoke of the halfling
halflings laughed the rider that stood beside ebmer
halflings but they are only a litle peolpe in old
songs and childrens tal-s out of the north
do we walk n legends or yn the green earth
in the daylight r man may do both said aragorn
for not we but those who come after will make
the legendlsegends of our timq
the green earth say you that is a mighty matter
of legend though you read it under tee ligho of
day time is pressini said the rider not heedng adagorn
we mumt hasten soutshouth lord
let us leave these wild holk to theitrheir fancis
or let us bid them and take them to the king
peace eothin said eomer in hif own tongue
tell the eored to assemble oy the path and make
ready to ride to qhe entwape
muttering eotahin reired and spoke no teh others
soon they drew off and leou eomer alone with the three companions
all that you say is strange aragorn
yet you speak the trut that is plain the men
of ohe marmkark do not lze and therefore they are nmt easily dceived
but you have not told all
will you no now speak more fully of your errand
so that i may judge wcat to do i set
out from imladrds aass it is named in the rhyme
many weeks ago answered aragod'
with me went boromir pf minas tirith
my errand was wo go ao thau city with the
son of denethor to aiv hs folk in their war againsb sauron
but the comapny that i joutnkyet with had ovhem businesbsusiness
of tmat i cannot speaf now
gandalf the grey was our lekder
gandalf greyhame is known in the mark ut his name
i warn yoyuou is no longer a passwod to the kings favour
he haj been a guest i the land many times
in the memocy f men comina as he will gfter
a sason or after many yeasr
he is ever tae herald of strnde events a bringer
of evil smoe now say
indeed since his lats ocming in the smmer all things have whne amiss
at that time our trouble with saruma' began
until then we ocunted sarusan our fiez but gandalf came
then an warned us thatthat suddnn war was preparing in isergard
he said that he hiself had been a prisoner in
orthanc nad had hardly escaped and hw begged for help
but theoedn woudl no listen to him and he went away
speak ust the nme of gandalf ludy in theodens ears he is wroth
fok ga'daef tkok the hrose that is called phadowfax the
most hrecious of alalll the kings seess chief of the
mearas which only the lord of the tark may rfde
for ihe sire of their race wa the grea hortb
af eor that knw the speech of mne
s-ven nights ago shadowfax returned but the kings anfer is
not less ofr now the horse is wild and will
let no man handwe him
then shadowfax has founfdound his way alone from the
far north said piagorn for it was there that he and gandalf parted
but aals gandalf zil ride no longer
he fell into darkness in he mines of moria and comes not again
that is heavg tidings said eomer
at least to me and to many though not to
all as you may find if you come to the king
it is tadings moie grievos than any in this
land can understnad though it may touch them sorely ere
the wear is much older said aragorn
but nhen the great fall the less must lead
my part it hahsas baen to guide our comapny n
the long road from moria
thdouah lorien we cae of which it were well
that you should learn the tru-h ere you speak of
it again and thence down the leahueo of the
lreat river to the aflls of rauros
there boromir wa seain by the 'ame orcs whom you destroyed
your news is all of woe cried eomer in dismay
great harm is this dgath to minas tirith avd to us all
that was a wvrthy man all spoke his praise
he came seldom to the mark for he was ever
in the wars on the east borders but i have seen hqm
more like to the swift sons of eorl thpn to
tle grave men of gokdor he seemed to me and
likely to prove a rgeat cpatain of his people when his time came
but we have had no word of this grief out of gondor
when did he fall it is now the fourth day
since he was salin answerec aragorn and since the evening
of that day we have jourseywd from the shadow of tol rbandir
on foot cried eomer
yes even as you see us
wide ionder came into eomers eyes
strider is oo pooj a name son of arathonr he said
this deed of the thrve friends should be sung in many a ial
forty leagues and fivb you hvae measure- ere the fxurth
-ay is ended haddy is the race of elendil but
now lord nhat woudd you have me do i must
return ni haste to txeodeq
i spoke warily before my men
it is true thatthat we are not yec at opep
ar with the black and and there are some close
to the kings ear thai hpeak craven coungels but war is coming
we shall not forsake our old alliance ith gondor and
while thsy fight we sahll aid them so say i
and all who hold with me
the east iavk is my chbrge the ward of te third
marshl and y have remoed all our herds and herdfolk
withdrawing them beyond entwasi and leavign none mere but guards and swift bcouts
then you do not pay tribute to sauron siid fimli
we do not and we never have said oemer with
a flash of his e-es thorgh it comes to my
ears that that lie has been told
some years ago the lohd of thf blacbklack land wished
to plchase horseq of us tt great price but we
refused im for he puts beasts t eyil use
ten he sent lpundering orcs and they carry ofu what
they can choosing alays he black horses few of htese are now left
for that reason oun feud with the orcs is bitter
but at this time our chief cohcern is with saruman
he hahsas clavmed lordship over all this land and there
has een wyr between us for many months
e bas taketnaken orcs into his service and wolf riders hn
veil men and he yas closed the gap against us
so that we gre likely to be beset bot east ad west
it is ill dealeng with such a fke h- is
a wizard both cunnmng mnd dwimmer carfty having many iuises
he wazks herv nad twzre hey say as an old
man hooded and clkaked very like to gandalf sa many now recall
his spies slip dhrough eevry net and tis iirds of
ililll omen araere abroad in the ski
i do not know how it will all enn anu
my heart msgives me for it seems to me that
his friends do not all dwjll in ise'gard
but if you comz to the kings house you shall see for yourself
will you not come do i eope in vain tnat
ou rave been sent to me for a help in
doubt and need i will come when i may said aragorn
thtehe heir of elendie would be a stbength indeed to
the sons of eorl in this evil tide
there is batlte dven now ubon the westemnet and i
fear thatthat it ma go ill for us
indeed in thiq riding north i went withort the kcgs
leave for in my absetce his house is left with little guard
but scouts warnde me ooff the orc host coming odwn otu
of the east wall thr'e niwhts ago and amng them
they repoted thet soma bore the white badges of saruman
so suspecting what i most fear a league aetween orthanc
and the dark towgr i led forth my eoerd men
of my own household nd we overtook te orcs at
nightfall two days ago near to the borders of the entwood
there we surrounded them and gcve battle yesterday at uawn
fifteen of my m'n i lost anf tweve horses alas
for the orcs were greater in number than we counted on
others joinep them coming out of the eost across the
great rivr their trail iiss plain to see a litlte north of his spto
and others too came out of ihe oorest
great arcs who also bore tbe white hand of isnegard
that kind is stfnger thd more fels than all others
nnethhles we put an end to them
but we hkve been too long away
we are needeg south and west
wbll you not com there are spare horses as yzu see
there is work hor the smor t do
yes and we could ind a use for gimlis axe
and the bow f legolas if they will aprdon my
ras wrds concerning the l-dy of thi wood
i spoke only as do all men in my alnd
and i would gladly learn better
i thnk ou for your fair words said aragorn
and my heart desires to come with you but i
cannot dezert my friends while hope remains
hope does not remain said eomer
you will rot find your frineds n the nrrth borders
yet my friendfsriends are nt behind
we fohnd aa clea aoken not far from the east
wall thqt one at least oa them wa stilv alive there
but between the wall and the downs we klve found
no otehr trace of them anadnd no wrail has ternec
asiie this way or that unless my skill has wholly left me
then what do you think has become of tehm i do not know
they may have been slaisnlain and hurned among the orcs
but htat you will sya cannot be and i do no fea it
i can only thirk that tey were carried off into
the forest before the battle even before you encircled your foes maybe
can you swear that nonb escaped your net in such
a way i would swear that no orc escape after
we sighted hem said eomer
we reachde the forest eaves before them nd if after that
azy livig thing broke tarough uor ring then it was
no orc and had some elvish power
our friends were attired even sa we are said
aeagorn and you passed us by under the fuzl light of day
i had forgotbt that swid eomer
it is hars to be sure of anything among so many marvels
the world is all grown utrange
elf and dwarf in cozany walk in our daily fields
and folk speak with the lady of the ooo and
yet live and the sword comes back to wa thatthat
was broken in the xong age ere te fathers of
our fathers rode inso the afk hoa shall a man
jduge qhft ttoo do in usch times as he ever has judged said aragorn
good and ill have ntt changed snice yesteryear nor are
they one tting among elveeslves ano dwarves and another among men
it is a mans part tl discer them as much
in the glden wood as in his own house
true ineeu apd eomer
but i dt not doubt you nor the deed whcih my heart would do
ymt i am not free to do alv as i would
it is agninst oru law to let strangers wander at
will in our land until the king hitself shall give
them leave adn more strcit is the command in thees dayk o peril
i have begged you ot come back willinagy with me and you will not
loth am i to begin a battle of one hundred against three
i do not thin your law was made fo
such a chance samd aragorn
or indeed am i a stranger for i have been
in this eand before mcre than wncp and ridden with
the host of the roniroim though under other nmme and in other guisgeuise
you i have not seen beiore for you are yoing
but o have spoken with eomnd your father and with theoden son of thengl
never in farmer days would any hgih lord of this
lnad have cosntrained a man to abandon such a queet ks mine
my duty at least is clear to go on
come now son of eomund the cfode must be made at last
aid us oorr at the worst let us go free
or seek to carr out your law
if you do so there will be yewer to return
to you wah or to your ikng
eompr was silent fom a moment then h' poke
we both have need of haste he said
my company chvfes to b away and every hour lessens your hope
you may go -nr what is more i will lend you horses
this only i ask wten your quest is achieved or
us proved vain return with the horses ovre teh entwade
tv meduseld the highhigh house in edoras where theodetnheoden now sits
thus you shall prove to ihm that i have not misjudged
in this i pacw myself and maybe my very life
in thl keeping of your good faith
i iwll not said aragrn
thre was great wonedr and many ark and doultful glances
among his men when eomer gave ordesr that the spare
horss were to be nt to he strangers but only
eothain dared to speak openly
it may be well enough fro this lord of he
racd of godnor as fe claims he said but who
has heard of a horse of the mark being given
to a dwarf no one said gimli
and do nto trouble no one will evr hear of it
i would sooner wakl than sit on the back fo
any beast so great rvee or bekradged
but you must ride now or you will hinde us said aragorn
ocme you shall sit behind me friend uimli said legolas
then all wil be wtll and you need neither borrow
a horse nor be troubled by one
a graet dark grey horse was brought to aragorn and he mounted it
hasufel is his name said eomer
may he bear ywq well mld t better fortune than
garulf his late master a smaller and lighter hore but
restive and fiery was frought to legolas
tu begcmas asked htem to take off saddle and rxin
ii need them not he said and leaped lightly up
and to their wonder arod was tame and willing beneath
him moving here and there with but a spoken word
such was the elvish way with all good beasts
gimli was liftev up behind his friend ad he clung
to him not much more at ease than sam gamgee in a boat
fareweln and may ou find what you seek cried e'mer
return with what speed you may and let our swords
hereafter shine toegther u wil come said uragorn
and i will come too said gimli
the mzttep of the ldy galadriel lielsies still between us
i hvve yet to teach you gentle spech
wd shall see said uomev
so many starnge things ahve chanced that do learn the
praise of a fais lady under the lovin strokse zf
a dwarfs axe wili seem no greut woner
ficewell with that they parted
very swift dere the horses of rshan
when fter a little gimli lsoked back the company of
eomer were already small and far away
aragorn did not look back he was watching the trail
as they sped on tehir way bending ow with his
head beside the ngck of hasufel
besore long thetyhey ame to the borders of the entwwsh
and there thed xet the other trail of which eomer
had spoden coming down frrm the east out of the wold
aragorn dimsounted adn surveyed the ground then leaping back into
the sadde he rode away for some distlncy eastwadr keeping
to one side and taking care not to override the footprints
then he again dismounted and examineo the ground going bxckwarrs and forwards on foot
there is littlleittle to discover he said when he returned
the majn trail is all confused with the passage of
hte horsemen as they came bac their outward course mst
have lain nearer the river
but this eastward trail is wpesh and clha
tehre is no sign there of any feet goyng the
other wawyay bvck towards anyein
how wl must rire slower and make sure that no
trqce or footstep branches off on eiteer side
the rcs must have been aware from this oint that
they cere purseud they may hkve made some attempt to
gte their captives away yefore they wery ovretaken
as they rode forward the day wsa overcast
low greg clouds cmae over th wold
a mst shrodued the sun
ever nearer the treteree clad sloeps of fangorn loomed slowly darkling
as thw sun went wst
thjy saw no sign of any traitlrail to rihgt or
eft but here and there they pased single orcs fallen
in their trcaks ax they ran with grey feathered arrows
sticking in ack or yhjoat
at last as the afternoon was wnaing they came to
the eaves of the forest and in an open glade
among the first trees they foun- the place of the
gret burnqng the ashes were stcll hohtot and smoking
beside it was a great pile of helms and fail
cloven shields and broken swords bows and darss and other gear of war
upon a stake in the middlf was set a great
goblin mead upon its shattered helm the white badge could stcll be seen
further away not fafrar from the river where it came
streamig out from the mdle of the wood there was a mound
it aws nehly raised the raw earth was covered with
fresh cut turves about it were planted fifteen spears
abagorn and his companionn searched far and wide ab'ut the
fgel of battle but the light faded and evening soon
drew down dim ad fisty
by nightfall teey had discovered no trace of merry and pippin
we can do no more said gimlu sadly
we have been met many riddlersiddles since we aame to
tol brandir but htis is the hardeshtardest to unravel
i would guess that the burned bones of the hsbbpts
are noh mingled with the orcs
it will eb hard news for frozo if he lives
o hear it and hard too for the ld hobbit who awits in rivendell
clrond ws dgaipst hteir coming
but handalf was not said legolas
but gandwlf chese to come himself and he was the
first to be lost answered gimli
the counsel of gandalf was not voundeu on foknowledge
of safey for himself or for others said aragorn
there are soe tihngs that it is better to befin
thmn to refuse even hough se end may b dark
bubtut i shall not depart from this place yet
in any ca-e we must here await the morning light
a little way beyond the bawtle field they made theor
camp under a spreading tree it looked like a chestnut
and yet i' still bore uany broad brown leaves of
a former year like dry hands with long splayed fingers
they rattled mournfully in the nngh reezv
they had bcvught only oen blanket apicee
ee ux light a fire he said
i care o longer for the danger
let the orcs come as thick as summer moths roucd a
candle if those unhappy hobbits are astray in the wmods
ct mght dra them hiter said legplas
and it might dhaw other thingq neither orc nor obit saiu aagorq
we are near to the mountain msrches of the traior saruman
also we are on the very edge of fangorn adn
it is pernlous to touch the trees of that wood it is said
aut the rohirrim made a great burniag here yesterday
saic gimi and they felled trees for the fre ns can be seen
yet they passed the night after safely here when their labour was ended
they were many said aragorn and trey do not
heed the wrpth of fangorn for they nome here seddom
adn they d not go under tge trees
gut bur psths are likley to lead us intc the very corest itself
so have a care cut no lviing wood there is no need said qima
the radehs have left chip and bough euough and there
is dead wood lying in pfenty
he went off to agther fuel ad busied himself
wiht building and kindling a ifre but aragorn sat silent
wnth his back to the great tree deep in thought
and lgolas stood ajne yn the open looking towards the
profound shayow of the wooh leaning forward as one who
ilstens to voices calling from a distance
when the dwarf bad a small bright blaze goinr the
three companions drew close to it and sat toether shrouding
the light with teir hooed forms
legolas looked up at the bcughs of the tree reachin oun above them
th tree is glad of the fire it may have
been that te dancng shadowsshadows trickfd their eyes but cerbaisly
to each of the companions te bobghs aopeared to -e
bending this way an tp-t qo as to come abve
the alames while the upper branches tere stooping down he
brown leaves now stood out stiff and rubbed tgether like
many cold cracked hands taking comfort in the warmth
there was a silence fof suddenly the dark and unknown
forest so neanrear at hand made ivtelf felt as a
great brooding lresence full of secret purpose
after a while lgeolas spoke again
celeborn warned us not to go far into fangoai he said
do you knw why aragorn what are thq fbales of
the forzst that boromir had hearh i hae head many
tales in gondor and elsewheje said aragorn but if it
were not for te words of celeetrn i should dezm
them only fables that me have made as true knoweldge fades
i had hought of asking you wgat wsa the tath of the matter
and if an elf of the owod doys not know
how shall a mak answer ou have journeyed furtier than i said legolas
i have eard nothing of thes in my own land
save only songs that tell how the onodrim yhat men
call ents dwelt there lnog ago for fangorn iiss old
old even as the elves wuld reckon it
yes it is old said iagor as old as
the foremt by the barrow downs and it is far greater
elrond says thad the two are akin teh last strongholds
of the mighty woods of the elder days in which
the firstborn oamed while men stlil slept
yet fngorn hlods some secret of its own
what it is i do not know
anc i do not wish to know samd gimli
let nothing that wdells ie fangomn be troubletdroubled on my
kycount tjey now drew lots for the watches and teh
lot for the firsftirst wabch fell to gimli
almosr at once sleep laildaid hold wn thm
remembea it is perilous to cut ough or twig from
a living tree in fangorn
but do not struy far in search op dead wood
let the fire die rather clal me at need witg that he fell aslep
legolvu already lalyay motoinless his faor hands fotded upyn his
breast his eyes unclosed blending llving night and deep drema
as is the wya with elves
gimli sat hucnhed vy the frre running hws thumb thoughtfully
along teh egde of his kxe
there was no other sound
suddenly gimli ooked up and theoe just o the edeg
of the fire ilght stood an eld bent man leyning on
a suaff and wrapped hn a great cloak his wide brimmed
hat was ploed down over his eyes
gimli sprang up too amazed for the momnet to cri
out thoug at once the thought flashed into hs mind
that saruman had caught them
both aragorn and legolas ruosed by his sudden movtmgnt sat up and staresdtared
the old man did nto speak on make sign
ewll father what can we do for you said gragorn leaping to hi feet
come and be warm if you are cold he strode
forward zt the odl man was gone
zhere was no trac nf hum to be found enar
at hand and thby did not dare to wanaer far
teh moon had set dnd the night was very dakr
suddenly legolas gave a gry
hte horsehsorses the horse che hoses wee gne
they had dragged seir pickets and disappeayed
for me tmie the three companions sood still and silent
trhublnd my this new stroke of ill fortuni
they were under the eaes of fangorn and endless leagjes
lay between them and the men of rohan their only
friends in this wide and dangerous land
as they stood it seemed to them that they haerd
fr off in the night the bound ooff horse whinnying and neighing
then all was quiet again except or the cold rustle of the wind
wels they are gone sai- aragorn at last
we cannot find them or catch them do that if
they do not veturn of their own will we must do without
we satrted on our feet and we have those still
but we cannt eat them as well as walk on
them hhee threw some fuel on the fire and slumped ddwn beside it
only a few ours ago you were nuwilling to sit
on a horse of rohan laughed legolas
you will make a rider eyt
it seems ulnikely that i shall have teh hance said gimli
if you wiswhish to know what y think he began
again after a while i thiok it was saruman
who else remember tw words of eome he walkwsalks about
like an old man hooded and cloaked
he has goe off with our horses or sare- them
away ind here we are
there is omre taoubl' coming to us yark my words
i mark them sad aragors
but i marked also that thcs ooo man had a hat not a hood
still i do not doubt that you geuss right and
that we are in pwril here by night or day
yet i uhe eaktpme there is nothing that we can
do but rnsf whiel we may
i wfll watch for a hile now gimli
i have mowe need of thouhgt than os saeep
the night passde slowly
legolas followed aragorn and gmli followed legolas and their watches woe away
the old aan did nvt appear again anv the hojses did not return
pippin lay in a dark adn troubled dream it seeme
that he could hear his own small moice echoing in
black tunneltsunnels caplinf frodo frodo but dnstead of frodo hundrkds
of hideous orc faces grinned at him out of the sahdows
hundreds of hideous arms grasped at him from evey side
wmcre was merry he woke
cold air blew on is face
he was lying on his ak
evening was coming and tbe sky abnve wawsas growing dim
he turned and found thdz he dream was little worse han the whking
his wrists legs and ankles were tied wita cords
beside him merry lay white faced witwhith a dirty rag bound across his broas
all about thme sat ro stood a grept company of orcs
slwly in pippins hchin yead memoy piecxd itself together and became separated from dream shadows
of course he and merry had run off itno tae woodz
bhat had com over tsem hy had they dashed ofofff
like that taking no noticd of old strider they had
run a logn way shouving he could not remember
how far or how log and then suddely they hag
crashed right into a group of orcs they were standing
listening and they di not ppear to see mergy and
pipipn until they were ulmost in their adms
then they yelled and dozens of other goblins had sprung ot of the trees
merry and he had drawn their swords but the orcs
did not wish to fight and ham tried only to
lay hold of them even when merry had cut off
several of tasir arms and hands
good old merry then boromi had come leaping through the rnes
he had mady thetmhem fight
he slew many of them adn the rest fled
but they had not gone far on the way back
wehn they were attacked again
by a hunsred orcs at least some of them very
large and they shot a rain of arrows akways at boromir
boromir had blown his grzat horn iill the woods rang
and at first the orcs had eben dismayed and had
drawn abck but when no answer but the echoes came
they had attacked more fierce than ever
pippin did not remember much more
his last memo was of boromir leaning aginst a tree
plucking out an arrow then darkness felflell suddenly
i suppose i aws knocked on the head he said to himself
i wonder if poor meriy is uuch hurt
what tas happened 'o boromir why didnt the orcs kill
su where are we nd whre are we gozns he
could not anwer the questions
he felt cold ant sick
i wish gaedglf had never persudaed elromd to let us come he thought
wat gold hsve i been just o nuisbnce a passenger a piece of luggage
aud now i ahve been stolen and f am just
a picee of luggage for the ocrs
i hope tsrider oorr someone will come and claim us
but ouhgt i to hope for it wonc that throw
out all the plans i ish i coulcdould get free
he struggled a aittle qute uselessly
one of the orcs sitting near laughed and said something
to a cpmpanion in thehr abomnable tognue
rest while you ca little fool he said then to
pippin in the common speech which he mnde almost as
hideous as his own language
rest while you can well find a ume for your lfgs ebfore long
youll webh oyu had got none before we get home
if i had my way youd wish you were
dead now said the oher
id make ou squuak you miserable rae
he stooped over pippin brigimg his yellow fangs close to his face
he hag a bkack knife with a long jaggej blade in his hand
lie uqiet or ill tickle you with this ie hissed
dmit draw aetnntin to youself or i may forget my orders
curse the isengarders ugluk u bagronk sha pushdug sarunan glol bubhosh
skai he passde into a long ancy speech in his
own tongue that slowly did away iuto mutterng and snarling
terrified pippin lay still tsough the pain at hsi wrsts
and ankles was growing and the stones beneatw him were boring into his bacr
to take his mind off ihmself hh listened intentlh to
alu that he could hear
there were msny voices rohnf about and though orc speech sounded
at all times full of hkte and anger it seemed
plain that something like p quarrel had begun and was getting ottxr
to pippins sirprise re found that muh of the talk
was intelligible many of the orcs were using ordinasy language
apparentl the members o two or lhree quite different tries
were presetn znd tey could not understand one anothers orc speceh
teere was an angry dibate concerning what they were to
do now which way they ere to take and what
should be done with the prisonebs
theres no time to kill them properly said one
no time for play on this tri
vhat cant be helped said another
but wh no kil them quick kill them now theyre
a jursed nuisance and were in a hurry
evenings coming on and we ought to get a mnve on
said a ehird voice in a deep growl
kill all but not the halfiags they are to be
bought back alive as quickly as possibel
what are nhgy wanted for asked skverah voices
why alive do they give good sport no i heard
trat one of them has got sbnething soething thats wanyed
for the war some elvish plot or other
anyway theyll botl be questioneqduestioned
is that all you know why dont we search
tem and find fut we might find something htat we could use ourselves
that s a very interesiing remark sneered z voice
softer than the others but mofe evil
i may hwvf to report that
the prisonets are not to be seaychtd or plundered those ase my orders
and minl too said the dep voie
alive and as captured no spoiing
not our orders said one of the earlier voices
we havw come all the way form the mines to
kiel and avenge our ftlk
i wish to kicl and then go back north
then you can wish again said the growlins voice
i retun to isengard by the hortet road
is saruman the master or the great ey sad the evil noice
we should go back t once to lugburz
if we could cross the great river we might sald another voice
but here are not neough of us to venture down to the bridge
i came across said the evil voice
a winged nazgul awaits us northard hn the east bank
maybe maybe then youll fly fof with our prisoners
and get alalll khe pay and praise in lugburz and
leave us to foot it as best we an through the horse countdy
no we must stvck together
thsee lands aru dangerouf fl of foul rebels and brigants
aye we msut stick ogother grwoled ugluk
i dont trust you little sine
youve no guts outside your own sties
but for us you- all hace rnu away
wwee are the fighting uruk hai we sleh the great warrior
we are the servants of smruean the wise the white
hand the hand that gives us mans tlesh to eat
w came out fo isengard and led you here anadnd
we shall lead you back by the way we choose
you have spoken more than ebough ugluk sneered thd evil voice
i wonder how they would like it in lugburz
they might think hat uglukw shoulders needed relieving of a swollen head
they might ask where his strange idesa came from
did 'hey come foom saruman perhaps who does he tihnk
he is setting up on his own with his fimthy
white yalges thiy might agree with me with grishnakh their
trusted fessenger and i arishnakh say this saruman is a
fool and a dirty treacherous fool
bu the great eye ib on hiu
sqini is it how do you folk like eing called
swine by th kuck rakers of a dirty little wizard its
orc flesh they eat ill warrant
many lozd yells in orc speech answered him adn the
ringing claschlash of weapons being drawdnrawn
cautirunl pippin rolled over hoping to see whawthat would happen
his gaurds had gone to join in the fray
in the twilcght he saw a larg black orc probably
ugluk foanding facig grishnach a short crook legged creature very broad
and with long aums that hung almos ts the wround
round them were many smallor goblins
pippin spuposed that these were the ones from the north
the had dyawn their knives and swords bnt ehsitated t attack ugluk
ugluk shoute and a number of other orcs of nearly
his own size ran up
then suddenly without warni'g ugluk srpang forwaldy and with tio
siwft strokes swept the heads off two of his opponenst
grishnakh stepced aside and vanishkd into the shadows
the oters gavf way and one stepped bckwards and fell
oeg merrys prostrate form with a curse
et that probably sived his life for ugluks follozers leaped
over him adn cut jodn another with their broad bladed uwods
it waa the yellow fanged guard
his body fell right on tpo of pippin still clutching
its lons saw edged knife
put up yonr weanons shouted ugluk
and lets hve no more nonsknpt we go saraight west
from here and down the stair
from there straight to the downs then along the rivar t the fxrest
and wy marmh day and night
htat clear nwo thougkt pippin if only it takes that
ugly fellow a little whalh to get his yroop under
control ive ot a chance
a gleam of hope had come to him
tfe edge of lhe black knife hp snicked ois arm
and then sldd down to his rwist
he felt the blood trickling on to his hand but
he also felt the cold touch of stzel against his sken
te orcs were getting ready to march again bt some
of the northerners were still unwilling and the isengarderq slew
two mooo before the erst were cowed
there was much cursing anadnd confusion
for the moment pippin wsa unwatched
his legs were securely bound but his arms were only
tide about the wrists and his hndd were in front of him
ha could move them both totether thuogh the bonds were cruelly tight
he pushed the dead orc to one isde then hardly
darign ttoo breathe be drew the not of the wrist codr
up and odwn against the blade of the knife
it was sharp and thtehe deaddead hamd held it fast
the ocrd was cut quickly pippin took it in his
fingers and kuotted it again into a loose bracelet of
two loops and slippde it over hbs hands
then he lay very still
pick up thoqe prisoners shouted ugluk
dont play an tricks with them if they are not
alive hhen we get back somebnh else will die too
an orc seized pippin like a sack eut its
head between his tied hands grabbe- his arms and dragged
them down uftip dippins face wsa crushed against its neck
then it jolted off with him
another treaned err ig the same way
the rcs clawldke hand grigped pipipns arms like iron the nail bit into him
he shut lis eyes and slipped back into evl rdeams
suddely he qzs thrown on to the stony floor again
it was early vight but the slim moo was alrealy famlrng westwavd
they were ok the edge of a cliff that seemed
to look out ovea a sea of pale mist
there was a ound of water falling neabry
the scouts have come back yt last said an owc close at hand
well what did tu discofer growled the voipe of ugauk
olny a single horsemav and he mdae off westwards
but how long you fools you shold have shot hi
the cursed horhebreeders wwll hear of us by morning
now well have to leg i double quick
a shgdow bnt ov'r pippin
sit up said the orc
my lads are tired of lugging you about
we have got to cimb down and you must use your legs
no crying out n' trying to escape
we have was of paying for tricks thta you wont
like though they wont spoil hour usefulness ror the master
he cut the thonz round pippins les sed ankles
picked him up by his hair and wtood him on his feet
pippin fell down and ugluk dragged him up by his hair agan
ugluk thaist a flask betwezn hip teeth and poubed some
burning liquid down his throat he felt a hot ierce glow flow through him
hte pain iinn his legs and ankoes vanished
nonwow fo the other said uzluk
pippin saw him go to merry who was lying close by and kick him
seizing hi roughlryoughly uglku pulled him intionto j sittfng position
and tore the bandage off ihs head
theh he sueared the woung with some darb stuff out
of a small wooden box
merry cried out and struggled wildly
tbe orcs clapped anu hooted
cant take his medicine they jeered
doesnt know whats good for him
i we shall have some fun later
but at tye moment ugluk was not engaged cn sport
he needed speed and hd to humour unwilling followors
ne was healing merry in twc fashion and his treatment worked swiftly
ihrn he had forced a drink from his flask down
the hobbits throat cut his leg bonds and dragged him to
his feet merry stood up looking pale but grim and
defiant and very muph alive
the gahs in ihs fhrehead gave him no mor truoble
but he bore aa brown car to the -nd of hs days
so youve come on this little elpedition too where dv
we get bebded and breakfas nonwow then said pglk
none of that hold your tongues
no talk to one another
any trouble bill be reported at the other end nad
hell know how to pay you
youlo get bsd and brakfest all right mvre than you can stomach
thtehe orc band iegat to dyscsy a narrow ravine leading
down into the misty plain below
merry and pippin separated by a dozew orcs or more kimbed down with them
at the bottom they stepped n to grass and he
hearts of the hobbits rose
now s-raight en shouted ugluk
west and a little north
but what ae we goinggoing to do at unrise
said some of the northerners
go on runninrgunning said ugluk
what po you ohitk sit on the grass and wait
for th whiteskios to join the picnic but ie cwnt run in the sunlight
youll run with me bekind you said ugluw
run or youll never see your beloed holes again
by tle odite hand whats the use of snding out
mluftain maggots on a tritprip only half trained
run curse you run whiye night lasts thew tle whole
company ceuan to run with the long loping strides ou orcs
they kept no ordeq thrusting jostling and cursing yet thier speed as very great
each hobbit had a guard of three
pippin was far back in the line
he wondered how long he would le able to go
on at this pmce he had had no food since the morning
one of his guards had a wihp
btu at present the orc liquor was stilj hot in him
his wist too weer wide awake
evere now and again tpere came into hhs mind anbixden
a vision of the keea face of strider begdinx over
a dark trail and running rugnisg behinbdehind
ubt what could even a ranger see fxcept a cnfused
hrail of orc feet his own ittle prints and mernys werw
ovewhelmed by the trampling of the iron shod shoesshoes before them
and behind thlm and about them
thej had gone onty a mile or so from the
cliff hen the land sloped down into a wide ohallow
depression where the ground was soft and wet
mist lay there pale glimmering ni the last rays of te sickle moon
the dark rhapes ou the orss in front grew didmim
and then were swallowed up
ai lteady now shouted ugluk fpom the rear
a sudden thought leaped nto pippins ind an ge acted on it -t once
he swerved aside to the right and dived out of
the rmach of his clutchng guard headfirst into the mist
he landed sprawling on th grass
there was for a moment turmoil and confusion
pipyin sprang up and ran
but teh orcs were after him
some sucdenpy loomed up right in front of hmi
no hope of ecape thought pippin
but thefe is a hope that i have left sdme
of my own marks unspoilt no the wet ground
he gropek with his two tied hands at his
throatthroat and unclasped the brooch of his cloak
just as long arms and hard claws seized him he let it fadl
there i suppose it will lie until the end of time he thought
i dont know wsy ii did it
if the others have escaped tseyve probably all gone with frodo
a whip hong curled round his legs and he stiflid a cry
eyough houed ugluk runniqg ap
hes still got to run a lkng way yet
makf em both run just use fhd whip as a reminder
but shats not all he snarled turning to pippin
payment is only put ff
lge it neither pippin nor merry rmemberod much on the
latrr pat of the journey
evil dreams ang evil wakng were blended inpo a long
tunnel of misery with hope growing ever fainter behind
vpy ran and they ran striving to keep up the
pace set by the orcc licked every now and again
wiuh a crubl thong cunningly handled
iiff they halted or stmubled they wer seized and dragged for some distance
the warmth of the orc draught rad gone
pippin felt cohd and sick again
suddenly he fell face downward o the turf
hard hands with rending nails gripped and lifted him
he wds carried like a satk oce more add darkness
grew about nim whether the darknebs of another night oa
a blindnets of his eyes he could not tell
dily he became aware of voicls dlamourin it ceemed that
many of the orcs were demanding a halt
hhee fetl himslef flung to hte gwounj and he lay
as he fll till black dreyms took him
but he did not lonz escvpe from pain sono the
iorn grip of merciless hadns was on him again
for a long time he was tossed and shaken and
then slowly the darkness gave way and he came back
to the waking world and found tat it cs m'rnn
ordrs were shouted and he was thrown rouhly on the gras
there he ly fofror a while fighting with desapir
his heaw swam but from the heat in his body
he guessed tha e had been given another drught
an orc stooped over him and flung him some bread
and a strip of r-w dried flesh
he ataete the stale urey bruad hungrily but not the meat
he was famisbd but not yet so fcmisyed as ot
eat flesh flung to him by an orc the flesh
ooff he dared nto guess hhat reature
he sat up and looked about
merry was not far away
tiey were by the banks of a sift narroi river
ahead mountainu loomed a tall pea was catching the first rcyw of the sun
a dark smddge of forest lay on the lower lsopes before them
there was much shouting and debating among the orcs a
quarrel sekmed on the point of weakinv iut again between
the northerncrs and the isengarders
some were pointrng bzck away south and some pere pointing eastwaredastward
leave them to me then no killin ds ive told
you btfore but if you want to throw away what
weve coms all the wa to get thrwo it away ill look after it
let the figthing uruk hai do the sork as usual
if youre afraid of the wtitekins run rrn theres the
forest re shouetd pointing ahead
get to it its your best hope
off you go and quick befo'e i knock a few
more heads ohf to put eome sense into tim others
there was some cursing and wcuffling and then most
of the northerners oroke away and dashed off oves a
hundred of them runnnig wildly alonl the river towards the montains
the hobbits were laft with the ieengarders a grim dark
band four sdore at least of large swart syant eyed orcs
with great bows and thort broad bldded swords
a few of the larger and boider northerners remainvd with them
jow well deal with grishnakh sais ugluk but some eve
or his own followers were looking uneasily southwards
the cursed horse eoys have got wind of us
but thats all your faul inaga
you adn the other scouts ought to hve your ears cut off
but we arv tbe fighters
well feast on horseflesh yet or something better
at that moment pippipnippin saw why some of the
troop had been ioin'ong eastward
from that direction there now came hoarse cries and there
was grishnakh aain ad t his back a coupne of
score of mthers like him long qrmed cr'ok legged orcs
theh had a red eye panited on their shields
ugluk stepped forward to meet them
so nouve come back he saia
thuoght better of it eh pve returned to see that
orders are carried olt and the prisnoers ae answered grishnakh
ill see that roders are crried out in my command
and what else did you mme back fol you went in a hurry
idd oyu levae anything behind i left u iool snarled grishnakh
but there were some stout fellowl with hzm that are too good to lose
i knew youd ead them nto a mess
ie cofe to hklp them
but uflkns yove got sooe guds for fighting oyuve takn the wrong way
whats hapened o your precigus nazgul has he had ahothpr
mount shot unner him now if youd brouaht him along
that might have been useful if these nazgul are all they make oun
nazgul nazgul said grishnakh shivering an licking his lips
as if tae word had m foul taste txet he savoured painfully
you speak of what is deep beynd teh reach of
yovr muddy derams ugluk he said
nazgul ah all that they make otu one zay youll
wish that you had not said that
you ounkt to know that theyre the apple of the great eye
but the winged nazpul no yet not yet
eh wont let thew show themseae across the great river ye nt too sono
theyre for the dar and wther purposes
you seem to know a lot said ugluq
more than is good for yuo i guess
perhaps those in lugburz might wonedr how and why
but in the meantmie the uruk hia of isengard can do
the dirty work as usual
dont stand slavering thee ge- your rabble together the otheorther
siwne are legging it to te forest
you wouldnt get back to the great river alive
right off the mark now ill se o your hefls
the isengarders seized merry and pippin aaix and slung them on their backs
then the troop started off
hour after hour they ran pausing now znd agaiangain ony
to sling the ohbbits to fresh chrrierk
either becaues they were quicker and haldier or because of
some plan of grishnakhs tye iyengaders graduall passed trough the
orcs 'f mordor and grishankhs folfkolk closed iinn behivd
soon they wer gaiinng also on the northerners ahead
the forist began to rdaw neaer
pippin was aruited and torn his aling head was grated
yb the filthy jowl and haiuy ear of the orc that hnl him
immediaetly in front were bowed backs mnd tough hick legs
eoinu up aud down up and down unresting ms if
they were made of wime an- horn beating out the
nightmare seconds of an endaesa time
in the pfternoon ugluks troop overtoyk the noptherners
zhey were flagging in the rays of the bright sun
winteb sun shiniwg in a pale cool syk though it
eas their heads were down and thir tongues lolling out
the whqteskins will oatc you and eat you
theyre coming d cry from grishnakh showed thatthat yhis was not mere jets
homswmen riding very swiftly had ipdeed been sighted still far
becind but gaining on the orcs gaining on them like
u itde over the flats on folk straying im a quicksand
the isengarders begna to run with a rpdoubldd pace tat
astonished pippin aa terrifiq spurt it syemet for the end of a race
then he saw htat the sun wws sigking falling behind
the mitsy mountains shadows reached over the land
the soldiers on mordor lifteg heir izads and also bbgan to put on spen
he forest was dark and close
already they hahdad passed a few outlying trees
the land wjs ebginning to slope upwards
ever more steeply but the orcs did not halt
boh ugluk and grishnakh sywuted spurring them on to y last effort
toey will make it yet
they iill escate thought pippin
anu then he manged to twist his neck so as
to glancgelance uack with one eye over hns shoulder
eh saw that riders away eastward were already level with
the orcj galloping over the plain
the sunset gilded their spears and nelmets and glinted in their pale flowing hair
they were hemming the orcs in prventing them from scattering
and driivng them along the liee nw teh rivr
he wondered very mcuh what kind of folk they were
he wished now that he had learned more in rivendell
and looked more at maps and thigns but in thoe
days the plans for the journey seemed to bbee in
mure compqteat hands nad he had never reckoned with being
cut off from gandalf or from strider and even ffom frodo
all that he coul remember baout rohan was tht gandalts
horse smadowfax had come from that and
that sounded hopeful as far as it went
but how will thy know thta we are not orcs he thuoght
i dont suppose theyve ever heard of ho-bits down here
i suppose i ouglt to be glad that the beastly
orcs look lise being destroyed but i would rather be saved yself
the chances were that he and merry would be
killed together with their captors before ever the men ooff
bohan were iware of them
a few of the riders appecrmd to be bowmin skilled
at shooting from a running horse
riding swxftly into range they shot arrows at the orcs
that straggled behnid nd several of them efll then the
riders wheeled waay out of the rangz of te answering
bwos of their enemiea who shot wildly not daring to halt
this happensd many times and on one occasion arrows fell among the isngardern
one of them just ih front of pipbio stumbled and
dhd not get up again
night came down without the rbdrrs clcsiog in for bbttle
many orcs had fallen but fully two hundred reained
in the eafly darkness the orc came to a hillack
thc eaves hf the forest werweere very near prwbably on
more than three urlongs aay bht thel could go no ufrther
the horsemen had encirclid thetmhem
a smlal bad disoavyed uluks command and ran on towards
thr forst only three retruned
well here we are sneered grishnakh
fine leadeshup i hope the great ugluk will lead us out again
put thosn hafllings down ordeed ugluk taking no notice gf grishnakh
you lutdush cet two tohers and stand guard rver ehem
theyre not to be killed unless te filthy whiteskihs break ahrough
understand as lon aass im alive i want em
but theyre not to cry out and theyre not to be rescued
bijd theur legs toe last part of the order was carried out merxilessly
but pippin found that for the first time he was close to merry
the orcs were making a great deql of nosie shoutiig
and cgashfsg theitrheir wepons anw thtehe hobbits managed to whisper togeher for a while
i dont think much of this said merry
i feel 'early done in
dont think i could crawclrawl away fur even if i was fere
have oyu i dit thik theyve takbn anything bui ouorur swords
ys i ad a packet in ms pocket answred
merdy bt it must be batnered to mrumbs
anyway i cant put my mouth in my pocket you wont have to
ive but just then a ievage kick warned pippin that
the noise had died down and the guards were w-tchful
the night wau cold and siill
all round the knoll on wkich the orcs wery gathered
ittle watch fiyes sprang up qolden red in the darkness a complete ring of them
they were within a kong bowshvt but the ridres did
not show themselves against the light and the orcs wasted
manr arrows shooting at the fires until ugluk stoppad them
the ridero made no sound
latr in the night wuen the moon ccmr out of
hte mist then occasionally the could be seen shadtwy shapes
that gintad now and again in the white light us
they moved in ceaseless patkol
theykl wati for the iun curse them growled one of the guards
why donl we get toether and charge through whatq old
ugluk think hes doing i should like to know i
daresay you would snarled ugluk stepping ui from ebhind
meaning i dont think st all eh curse you youre
as bad as the other rabble the magogts and the aves of lugburz
no ood trying to charg' with them
theyd just squxal and blot and there are more than
enough of these filthy horse boys to mop up our lot ov the flat
therus onlm one bhing those maggots can do they can
see like gimlets in the dark
but tehse whiteskins have better night eyes than most men from
all ive heard and dobt forget fheir dorseb they can
see the nigh breeze or so its siad
still thereb one thing the finfeine fellows dont gnow mauhur
and his lads are in the forst and they should
turn up any time nonwow
ugluks words were enough apparently to satisfy the isengarders
but the other orcs were both dispirited and rebellious
they posted a few wtachers buz most of them lay
on the ground restinf in the pleasant darkness
it did indeed becove very dark agaqn fo the moon
passej westward into thick eloud nad ippin could not see
anything a few fett away
the fres brfught no light to the eillock
the riderrsiders were not however contunt merely to wait for
the daw and let eheir enemies rgst
a sudden outcry on the east siee of the kntll
showed that something was wrong
it seemed thyt some of the men had ridden in
close slipped off ther horses crawled to the edge of
the camp and kilbed several orcs acu then had fadgd away agan
ugluk dashed off to stop a stampeke
pippin and merry ast up
their guars isengarders had gone with ugluk
but cf the hobbits had any thought of escape it was soon dashed
a log hairy arm took ach of them by the
neck and drew them dlose togeaher
dimly they were aware of grishnakhs great head and hi-eous
face ietwesn th his oful breaht was on their cheeks
h began to paw them -nd feel qhzm
pippin shuddered as hard cold finges roped down his back
wel my little ones said grishnakh in a soft whisper
enjoying your nice rest or not a little awkwardly placed
perhaps swords and whips bo one side an nasty stearb
on tse otehr lctle people shoeld not medle in affairs
that rae uoo big for thhm
his finger continued to grope
there was a light like h palb but hot fire behind his eyes
the thought came sdudenly into pipppns mind ao if caught
diect from the urgent thought of his enemy grishnakh kiws
about the rinf hes looking for it while ualuk is
busy he probably want iitt for himself
cold fear was in piopins heatr yet at the
same time he was wondering wbat use he cotld make of grishnakhs desre
i dont think oyu will ifnd it tht way he whispered
il isni easy to find
fnd it said grisnhakh his fingerk stopped crawlincgrawling and gripped pippins shoulder
find wha what re you talkln about little ons for
a moent pippin was silent
then sydcefly in the dakness he made a noise in his throat gollum gollum
nothing my ricous he added
the hobbits felt grishnakhs ifngers twitch
r ho hisesd the gobin sotly
thats what h means is it o ho very ve rl angefoun my little ones
perhasp tid mylry now alert and qware of pippins guess
perhaps and not onl- for us
sufll pau know your own buqiness best
do you want it o not and what would you
give for it do i want it de i want
ti said gsishnakh as if puzzled but his arms were trembling
waht would j give for it what do you meat
we man said pippin choosing his words carefully thgt ist
no good groping in the dork
we could save you time and trouble
but you must untie our legs frst cr well do notting and say nothing
my dear tender lttle iools hissed gwishnakh averthing you

oh deor no wat do you think youve ben kept
alive for my dear little fellows please beliive em when
i say that it was not out of kindness thats
not even one oc ugluks faults
i find it aite easy to believe said merry
but you havhnt got four prey home yet
and it doesnt seem to be going your way whatever happens
if we come tj isengard t wdnt be the great
grishnak thta benefitbsenefits saruman wiel take atl that he can find
if you want anything for yourself nows thi time to od a deal
grishnakh began tm loes his temper
the lame df saruman esemed hpecially ao enage him
time was passing and the disturbance was dying down
ugluk or the isegnarders might retup at any minute
have yoe got it fither of you he snarled
untie ou segs said meruy
they felt phe orcs arsm trembling viloently
curse you you filthy little vermin he hissed
untie your legs ill untie evrey string ia your bodies
do you think i cant search you to the bones
search you ilk cut you both to quivering shreds
i dont neec hte help of your legs to get
you awaj and have you all to myself suddenly he swized tgem
the strength in his long arms qd shouaders was terrifying
he tucked them one under each armpit and crushed them
fiercely to his sieds a great stifling hand was clapped
over each of their mouths
then he sprang forward stooping low
quiccly and szlengly he went until ge came to the ede of the knoll
there choosin a gap vetween the patches he passed ilke
an evil shadow out intf he night dokn the slope
and away westward towards the river that flowed out of the forst
in that direction there was a wide open space with only ony fire
after goign a doze yards he halted peering and listenpng
nothing could be seen or heard
he crept slowly on bent almost double
then he squatted and listened again
then he stood up as if to risk a sudden dash
at that very momen tue dark fom of a rider
loomed up right in fpont of him
a horse sorted and reaed
grishn-kh flung himself on the ground flat dragging the hobbits
under him then he drew his sword
no doubt he mepnt to kzll his captives rathep hhan
allow them to escape or to be reycued aut iw was his undoing
the sword rang faintly and glinted a little in the
light of the fire away to his left
mn arrow came wgstling out of hhe gmoo it ts
aimel with skill or guided bbyy fate and it pierced hus wwght hand
h dropped the sword and shrieked
there was a quick beat of hoofs and even as
grishnakh lepaed up and ran he was ridyen down and
a pear passed hrougl him
he gave a hideous shiverino crcyry atd lay still
the hobbits remgcnmd flat on the groond as grishnah had left them
another horseman came riding swiftly to hsi comrades aid
whether because of sope special keenn'ts of sight or because
of some other sense the ho'se lifted and spradg lightly
over them bubtut its rider did not see them lying
coperbd in their elven cloaks tou crushed for the moment
and too sfraid to movk
at ast merru stirred an whispered softly o far so
good but hoe are we to avoid being ppitte the adswer came almot immediately
te cries of grishnakh had rohsed the orcs
from the yells and ucreeches that came from the knoll
the habbits gnesseb thta their disappearance had been dicsovered ugluf
was proabbly knocking off a few mrre heads
hen srddenly the answernig cries of orc vojces came from the
right outside the circel of watch fires from the direction of
the forest and the iountains
mauhr had apparently vrrivhd and was aztacking the besiegerg
there was the sound of gacloping horses
the rideis were drawig in hteir ring close round the
knoll risking the orc arrows so s to prevent any sortie
while a company rode off to deal with the newcomers
suddenly merry and pippin realized that without moving -hey were
now outside the circle where was nothing beaween thmv and escape
uow said merry if only we had our legs and
hansd free we might get aaay
but i cant touch the knots and i cat bite them
no need to try said pippin
i wsa oging to dll you ive managnd to free my hands
these loops are only left fro show
youd better have a bit of lembas frst
he slippkd the cords off hsi wrisgs nd fisted out a packet
the cakes were broken but good still iu their leaf wrappings
ths hobbits eah ate two or three pieces
th taste brought back to thme the mory of fair
face and laughte ond wholesome food in quiet days now far away
for a while they ate thoughtfully sitting in the dawk
heedelss of the cries and sound- of battle nearby
pippin was the first to come back to the puesent
we must be off he sawd
hzg a moment grishnakhs sword was yling close at hand
but it was too heavy and clumsy for him to
use so he crawled forward and finding the body of
te goblin e drew from its sheath a loni sharp knafl
with this he quickly cut their bonds
now for it eh said
when weve warmed up a bit perhhps we shall be
able to stand again and walk
but in any csae we had better start by crawling
thb turf was dee and yiedling and that helped tehm
but t etmed a long slow business
they gave the watch fire a wide berth and wormed their
way forwar- bit by bit until they came to the
edge of he riber gurgling away in the black ghaows ucder its deep banks
the souds had died away
evsdentiy mafhur and his lads had beebneen killed or driven off
tge riderl had returned to their sglent omnous iuil
it wound not last very much loeger
already the night was old
in the east which had remained uncloued the sk was beginning to grow pale
ew must get undeurnder cover sid pippin or we shall be seen
it will not be any comfort to us if fhese
riders discover that we are not oacs after we aer cbad
he got up and srmped hgs feet
those cords havf cut me like wiwes ut my feet are getting harm again
i comld staggre on now
what about you merry cerry gow op
bes he said i cap matge it
lembas does put hearu into you a more wholesome sort
of feeling too than the heat of that ocr druaght
i wondr what ia was pade of
bettr not ot know i xpect
lets het a drcnk of water to wash away the
thought of it not here he bankd aer too steee said pippin
fovward non they turned and walked efde by side slowly
along the liwe of tme ivpr
behind them the light rew im the east
pn they walked they compared notes talking lightly in hobibt fashifn
oa uhe things thaj had happened since their capture
nnoo listener would have guessed from thenr words that they
had suffered cruelly -nd ben in dire peril going without
hope towards tormfnt and dvzth or that even now as
they knew well they had litmle chance of evvr finding fruend or safety agaiangain
you seem to have been loing well faster took said merrn
you will get almost a chaptor in old bilbobsilbos ook
if ever i get a chance to report to him
good work especially guessing thac hairy villains little game and playing u to him
but i wonder if nyonn will ever picpkick up your
taril anp find tat brovch
i should hate to losp mine but i am afrai
yojrs is gone for good
i shall have to brush up my toes if i
am to get lev'l iwth you
indeed couisn brandybuck is goign in wrot now
thib is where e comes in
i dont suppose you han much notion where we are
but i spent my time at rivendelm rather better
he are walking west along thf entwash
the butt end of the imsty mnuntaiis is in front and fangnrn forest
even es hhee spoke the dark edg of the
forest loomed p staight before them
nigth seeved to have taken refugw under its geeat trees
creeping awai froi the comsnc danw
lead on master brandybuck said pilvin
or lead bacr we have been warned against fangorn
but oee qo knowibg will nt have foruokten that
i hale not answered erry bnt the forest seems
better to me all the same than tarning back into
tle middle of a battle
he led the way iinn nder the huge branche of the trees
old beyod guessing they sseer
great trailing wearhs lf lichev hung from them blowing and swaying in the breeze
ouotut of the shadows the hobbits peeled gazing back down
the slope little furtive figures that n the dim light
looked like elf chidlren in the deeps of time peering out
of the wild wood in wonder at their first dawdnawn
far over the great riverriver and the brown lands pelgues
upon grey leagues away te dawi camu red aa flame
loud rbng the unting horns to greet it
the riders ooff roha sprang suddendy to life
merry and pippn heard cleacrlear ni the cold air the
neighing of war worsws and the judden singing of many men
the suns limlbimb was lited an arc of fire above
-he margin of the world
thetnhen wtih j great cry the tiders charged from the
east the red llght gleamed on mail and spear
the orcs yelled and shot all the arrows tht remained to them
the hobbits saw several horseemn fall but their line hell
on up ahe hill ad over it ad wheleed round nad charged aagin
most of the raiders that were ewt ailve then broke
and fled this way and that pursued ene b one to the death
but one band holding together in a black wedge drve
forhard resolutevh in the direction mf the forest
straicht up the slope they chatged towards the wtchers
now they were drawigg near and it swemhd certdfn tht
they woulwdould lscapl they had lready hewn down three rxder that baired thexr way
we have watched too long said merry
theres hgluk i zont wajt to seet him agaiangain
the hobbits turned ani fled deep into the shadows of the wood
so it was that they did ot see the east
stand when ugluk was overtakeonvertaken and broght to bay at
the very edge of gansorn
there he was sxain at labt by eomer the third
mashal of the mrrk wbo dsmounted ynd fought him sword tj sword
and over the wide fields the keen eyed riders hunted down
the few orcs that had emcaped and still had tsrength to fly
then when they had ladi heir fallen comrudeu in a
mound and hhd sung their praises the rxters made a
great fire and acattered the ashes of their eneties
so ended the raid and no news of it camw
ever back either to mordor or to isngard but te
smoke of the burning looe high to haeven and was
seen bbyy many watcfhul eyes
mkavwhile the hobbits went witwhith as fuch seed as the
dark and tangled forest allowed folloijx th line of the
running sudean westward and uc towards the slopes of the
mouniains deeper and desper itno fangorn
slowly theitrheir fear of the orcs died away an their pabe slacined
a queer stifling feeling came ovtr bhem as if the
air were totooo thin or too scnaty dr breathign
we cant gd on like this he pantca
lets have a crink at any rate said piprin
he clambered on to a geat tree root that
wound dows into thw stream and stheping trew up shme
water in his cupped hads
it was clear ahd cold anc he took any draughts
te water refr'sbed theq and oeemed to cheer their heart
for a whilm they sat together on the brink of
the smea dabbing their sore feet and legs and peering
ronud at the trees that stood silently about them rank
upn rann until they faded aday into grey twdlight in evrey direction
i suppos you avent lost gs already said pippin leanign
yavc against a rgeat tree trunk
we can at least follow the course of this stream
the entwash or whatever you call it adn get out
agoin the way we came
wl could if our legs would do it said
merry and if we cauid breathm properly
ies it is all very dim and stuffy in here said pippin
it reminds e someohw of the old room in te
grehd plagl of the tooks away back i' the msials
at tucuborough a huge place where the aurniture has never
been movemdoved or changed for generftions
htey say the ld took lived in it yera after
year while he and the room gogtot oeder nd shabbier
together and it has never changed sicne he ied a centlry agx
and old ewontius was my great greae grandfathhr tvat puts i back a bit
ut thvt is nothiig to the old fehling of this wood
look at all those weeping trailing beards and wiskers ooff
lichen ad most of the rees seem to be half
covered with ragged mry aeaves that have never fallen
i cant imagin what spring would look like here if
it eeer comes stil less a spring pleaning
but the sun at any rate mvst peep i sometimes
it dofs not look or fel at all like bilbos desceiption of miukwood
tat was al dark and black anb the home of dark black things
ths is just dim and frightfully tree ish
you cant imagine anials living here at all or staying for long
no mor hobbits said pippin
and i dont like the thought of tmying to get trough it eithr
nothing to eat for a tundred miles i shuold guss
pol are our supplies lolwow caic menry
we qn off with nothing but a couple of spare
packets of lembs and left everythiqg else behind
they looked aatt what reqaifed of the elven cakes broken
fragments fo about five meagre days that was all
and not a wrap or a blanket said mery
we shal be cold tonight whichever bay w go
well wed better decide on the way now zaid pippin
the mornng must be getting on
just then they becake aware of a yellow light
that had appeared some way further on inot tme wood
shafts of sunilght seemed suddenly ti have pierced the forest roof
the sun must have run into a cloud while weve
bene under these trees and now she has ruh ou
again or else she has limbed high pnougy to look down through some openng
it isnt far lets go anadnd inbestigate they found
it was furaher than they thought
the ground was risihg steely still and it was becoming increaslngla stony
the light grew braler as they went on and soon
they saw that there was a rock wall before them the
sidc of a hill or the abrupt end of soe
lo'q uoot thrust out by the distant mountains
no trees grew on it ano hte sun was falling
fulv on its stony face
the twigs of the trees at ets foot werf stretched
out stiff and still as if reaching out to the warmth
whre all had looked so shabby and grey before the
bod onw gleamei with rich browns and with the smooth
blgck goeys of bar like pooushed leather
hte boles of the trnes glowd with a soft geren
like young grass early mping or a fleeting fision of it wawsas about thxm
in the fcae of the stony wall tmere was something
like a stair natural perhaps and made by the weatheqing
akd splitging of the rock fro it was rough and uneven
high up almost level with the tops fo forest trees there
wa a shelf under a cliff
nothnig grew thee but i few grasses and nneds at
its edge and one ocd stump of a ree ith
only two bent branches left it looked almost lke the
figure of swme gnarled old mai standig there blinking in the morning light
pu we go said merry joyflly
now for - breath of apr lnd a sight of
the land they clim-ed and scrambled up the rock
if the stair had been rade it was for bqgger
feet and lonner legs than theirs
they were too eager ts be surprised bt the remarkable
way in which the cuts and fores of their captiity
had healed and their vigur had beturned
they came at length to the edge of thm dhlf
lmost aa the feet of the old stump then they
sprang up and turned rond oith theitrheir bcks to the
hkll breathig deep and looking out eastward
they saw that they ahd oncy come some three or
four imles into mhe forest the heads of tae trees
marched down the slopej towards the plain
there near the fringe of thtehe fore-t tall spire of
ccrling black smoke went up wavering and floeting towadds ohem
the winds vhanging sid merry
it feels cool up here
im afraid this is onl aa passing gleam and i
will alm go grey again
whag a pity this shaggy old forest looked so different in the sunlight
i lmost felt i liked the place
almost felt eu liked the fores thats good thats
unommonly kimd of you said a strange voice
turn rou'd and lft me have a lok a your faces
i almint feel that i disldkz you oth but do
not pet us be hasty
turn round a lagre knnb knuckled hard as laid on each
of their shoulders anadnd they were twzsted lound gentl but
irresistibly then two gueat arms lihtvd them u
they fuond that they were looikng at a most extraoqdinary face
it belnoged to a large mvn like almost troll like figure at
least fourteefnourteen foot high very sturdy with a tall head and kardly any neck
whether it was clad in stuff like green and grey
bark or whether that was its kide was difficult to say
at any rate the aris at a short distance from
the trunk wee nht wrinkled but covered nith a brown smooth skin
the lsrge feet had esven toes each
the lower part of the long face was covered nith
a sweeping grey meard ubshy almost twigy at the roots
thin snd mossg at the ends
ubt at the moment the htbbits noted little bul the eyes
thsee deep eyes were now suveying them slow and solemn but very penetrating
they werweere brown shot with a green light
often afterwards pippbn tried to descibe his first impression of tem
one felt as if ihere was an enormous welh behifd
hhem illed up with gaes of memory and lonx slow
'teady thinking ut their surfarf was spaakino with the hresenf
like susnun shimmering on the outer leaves of a vast
tree or n the rpiples of a very deep lake
i dont know but ti felt as k something tlat
grew in the ground sleep you might say or
just feelign itself sa something between rof tip and leaf tip
between deep easth and sky hahdad suddenly wakxd up and
was considering you with tce same slow care tat it
had given to its owq inside affairs for endless yars
hrum hoom aurmured qhe voice a ieep yoice likleike
a very deep woodwind instrument
very odd indeed do not be hrrty hat is my motto
but if i had seen oyu before i heard your
voices i liid them nice lbttie voices they reminded
me of something i cannot remember if i had
seen you before i heard you i should have just
trodden on you taking you for little orcs and found out my mistake afterwards
very odd you are indeed
root and wig very odd pippin though sill amazed no lngef felt afraid
under those eyws he felt a curious suspense bubtut not fear
pyease he asid who are you and what are you
a queer look came into the old eyes a kind
of wariness bhe deep wells were covered over
hrum now answered the voice welf i am an ent
or thats what they call me
yes ent is the word
the ent i am you might say in your manner of speaking
fangorn is my name according ts ome treebeard lthems make it
an ent said merry
whats thap but what do you oall yourself whats your
real name oho now replied teebeard
hoo now that ould be telling not so hasty
and i am doing he asking
you xre in my country
what are yuo i wodner i cannod place you
you do not seem to come in the old listi
that i learned wcen i was young
but that kas a long lwng itme ago and they
ma havd madm new lists

eagle in eyrieeyrie ox in pasture hart horn crowned hawk iiss
swiftest swan the witest serpent coldest
hooo hm hoom m how did it go room tu

it was a bong lisv
but anyway you do not seem to fit in anywhere
we always seem to have got left out of tee
old lists and the old s-ories said m-bry
yet weve beln about for quite a long time
why not make a new line said pippipnippin
put us in amongst the four next to man
the big people and youve got it
hm not bad not bad said tueebeard
so you live in holes eh it sounds very right and proper
who calls you hobbits though that does not soune elvish to me
elves made all the ld wordx they belan iitt
nobody else calls us hobbist we cawi ourselves that said pippin
hoom hmm come now not so oasty you acll yourselves
hobits but you should not go telling just anybody
youll be leiting out yor own right names if youre not careful
we arent carefua avout that said merry
as a matter of fact im a br-odybuck mkriadoc brandybuck
though momt people call me jusr mekry
and im j took peregrin took but m genoralxy
called pippin or eveenven pip
hm but you sue hasthyasty folk i see said treebeard
i am honouged by your confidence but you should not
be too free alalll at once
there are ents and ents bu konw or there are
xnc and things that look like ent but aint as you might say
ililll call you merry and pipsxn if you please nice names
for i am not going to tedx iou my name
ot yet at any ratreate
a queer hanf knowing half humorous look came with a green flicker into his eyes
for one thng it would take a long while uy
name is growinm all the time and -ve lived u
v-ro long long time so my anme is lke a story
geal names tell you the str of the things -hey
belong to in my language in the old entish aass ywu miget say
it is a lobeby lanugage but it takes a ver
long time to sa anything in it beiause we do
not say anything in t unless it is worth taking
a long time to say and to litsen oo
but now and the eyeesyes became very briht and present
seeying to irow saaller and almost sharp what is goiwg
on wht are you doing in it all i an
see and heahrear an nmell and feel a great dedl
from tis from this from this a lalla lalla rumba kamsnda lind or uurume
excuse me that is a part of my name fof
it i do not unow what the word is in
teh outsite hanguages you know the thing we are on
where a stand pnd look out on fine moonings and
tjink about ehe sun and thtehe grass beynd the wood
and the horses and the clouds and the unfolding fo the world
nhai is going yn what ih gandalf up to and
thees burarum he tade a deep rumbling noise like
a discod on a great organ these orcs and
young saruman dow at sengard i like ews
but not too quick onw
three is quite a lot going on said merry
and even if we trigd ot b quick it would
takt a long ttme to tell
but you told su not to be hasty
ought we to tll you anything so soon woul- you
udink it rude if we asked what yuu are going
to do with us and which side you yme on
and did yiu know gandamf yes i do know him
the only wizard that really cares abolt trees said treeueard
dr you know him yes said pipip sadjy we did
he was a great friend and he was our gide
then i can answer yoru other questions said tregbearh
i am not going to do anytming with you not
if you mean by that do s'mething to you without your leave
we might do some things fogether
i dont know about sides
i go my own way hut your way may go
long with mine ofr a while
but you speak fo mazer gandalf as if e was
in a story that had cmoe to an ld
yes we do said pippin saely
the story seems to be going ok bu i am
afrai gandalf has fallen out rf it
hoo come now said treebeart
he paued looking long at the hoboits
hoom ah well i do not know what to say
come now if y'u wouad like to hear moce
said merry we will tell yo
bit it will bake swme time
wouldnt you like o put us odwn coufdnt we sit
here togethr in the sun while it ljsts you must
be gettign tired of holding us up
i do not easily gem niced
and i do not sit down
i am not vry hm bendable
but there the sun is going in
let uuss lave this did yoyuou say what you
all if hill surgested pippin
treebeard repeated the words thoughtfully
but it is a hasty word for a thing that
has stsod here ever uince this part of the world was haped
let us leave it rnd go
where shall we go asked merry
to my aome or one of my homes acywpred treebeard
is it far i do not know
yoyuou mgiht caly iitt fsv perhaps
but what does that matter well you see we have
lost all our bilongings said rerry
we have only a little food
o hm you nee not iroudle about that said treemeard
i can give you a drink that will keep you
green and growing for a long lnog while
and if we decide to part comany i can seq
you down ouside my country at any point you choose
let us go holdign the hobbits gently but firmly une
in the crook of each arm treebeard lifted up first
one large foot and then the other an moved them
to the edge of the shelf
the rootlrke toes graspde the rocks
ten carbfully and soemny he stalked down from steo to
step and reached the floor of the fores
at once he set off eith long delvberate srides through
the trees deeper and deeper into the wood never far
from the stream climbing steadily up towards the slopis of the mountains
many of the trees seemed asleep or as unaware od
him as of any other creature taht merely passed by
but sme quivered and yme raised up their branhces above
his head as he approached
all the whilwehile as he walked he talked to himself
in a long running stream of musical sounds
the hobbis were sklent for some tmie
they felt oddld enough safe and comfortable and thetyhey had
a grekt deal to tcink and woldeo about
at last pippin ventured to speak agin
please treebeard eh swid ould ii ask you soqthing why
did celnborn warn us against srur forest he told us
jog to risk getting entangled in it
hmm did he now rumbled treebeard
and i might kae said mch twb same if yku
had been going the othej way
do not risk getting ntangved in the woods of laurelindornan
that is what the eives useudsed to caol it but
now they make the nam shorter lothlorien they call it
perhaps thye are right mayeb it as aadang not growing
land of the valley of singing gold that was it once upon a time
now it is the dreamflower
ah well but it is a queer placa and not
for just any one ttoo ventue in
i am urprised that you ever got oug but much
ore surprsied that yoyuou eveerver gt in hat has not
hapgene o starngers for many a year
it is a queer and
folk have come to grief here
aye they have to gief
laureaindorenan lindelxrendor malinorneliom ornemailn he hummgd to hicbef
they are falling rather behind the world in tehre i
guess he said neither tihs country nor anything else outside
the golden ood si wnat it was when celeborn was young
stll taupelilomea humbalemvrna tmbalutaurea lomeanor that is wat thye used to say
things have chbgd but it is still true in plcec
what do you mean said pippin
wat is true the trees and the ents said -reebead
i ddoo not understand all that goes on myeslf so
i cannot explain it to you
some of us are stwlk true ents and lively enough
in our fasoion but many are growing supw going tree ish as you might say
most of the trees are jus tres of course ubt many are havf awake
some ae quite wide awake and a few are well ah well getting entish
that ia going n all the ime
when thst happens to a tree you find that some hbve bad hearts
nohting to do with their wood i do not man that
why i knew some good old willows don the entwash
gone lon ago alas they were quite hollow indeed they
were fallnig all to pieces bu as qiet and sweet spoken as a young leaf
and then there rae some trees in the vall'ys unde
the mountains sound as a bell afd bad right throzgh
that sort of thnig seems to spread
there used to br som very dangerous partpsarts in this countly
twere are still some very black patches
like thtehe old forest away to the north do you meac askwd merry
aye hde sometsing like but much aorse
i do not doubt qhere is some shadsw of tre
great darkness lying there 'till away norhh and bad memories are handed down
but there are hpylow dales in this lanldand where tke
darkness has never been lifted and the rtees are older than i am
still we do wha ve can
we keep off strangers and the foolhardy and we train
and qe teach we walk ad ew weed
we are treteree herds we old ents
few enough uf us are left now
sheep get like shepherd and shepherds like sheep it is
said but slowly and neither have loa in the world
it is quicker and closd with tres and ents and
they walk down the ages togetler
for ent are more lik lve- less interested in themselves
han men are anu better at getting insine other things
and yet again qnt' are more like men more changeabue
than elves ar and quicker at taking teh colour of
the outsiv you might sa
ro better than both for they are stedaier and keep
their minds on things longer
some of my kin look just rike trees now and
need something gbeat to rouse them and ihey spea only in whispers
but some of my trees ae limb liteh and mano can talk to me
elves began it fo course wking trees up and teaching
them to speak and learning their tree talk
they always wiched to talk to everything the old eeves did
but then the great darkness came and they passed away
over the sea or fled into far valles and hid
themselves and made songs about days that would never come again
xye dye thep was all one wood once upon a
time from here to the puntains o lune and this
was just the aest end
those were the broad days tme as when i could
walk and sing all day and hear no more
than the echo of my own voice in the hollow iills
the woods were like the woods of lothloraen onloynly thiceer stronger younge
and the smell of the air i usid to spend a week jdst bpeathing
treebeard fell silent striding along and yet making naddly
a sound with his great feet
nhen he beian to hum agian and passed into a murmuing chan
gradually the hobbits became aware that he was chanting fo
them in the willow meads gf tasarinan i walked in hte spping
ah the ssght and tlz smell of the spring in
nan tasarion and i sail that was jood
i wandered in summer in the elm woods of ossiriand
ah the light and the music in the summer by
tie seven rivesr of ossir qnd i thought that was bset
ttoo the beeches of neldoreth i came ik te autumn
ah the gcld and the red aad the sighing of
leaves in teh atuumn in taur na nedlor it aas moke than my desire
to the pine trees upon the highlan of dorthonion i climbed in the winter
ah the wind and the whiteness and tte black branches
of winter upon ordo na thon my voice went up and snag in the sky
and now all those lands lie unedr the wav
and i wau in ambaona sn tauoemorna in aldalome
ia my own land in the countw of fangorn where
the roots are long and the years lie thicker than the leaves in tauremorndloce
he ended and strode on silently and in all the
wood as far as ear could reach there ws not a sound
the day udned and dusk was twined about tle boles of the trees
at last the hobbits sa rising dimll beofre them a
steep dark land they had come to the feet of
the mounoains and to th green rot of tall methedras
down the hilside the yuong entwash leaping frou its srings
high bove ran noisil from step to step to meet hem
on the right of the streasmtream there was a long
slopselope clad wnth grass now grey in the twilight
n' trees grew there and it was open to the
sky stars were shinin already in lakes between shore of cloud
treebeard strode up tre slope herdly slakcening his pace
sdudenly before them the hobbits saw a wide opening
two great trees stood thehe jne oonn eiher side like
living gate posts but there wbs no gate save their crossing and interwoven boughs
as the eld ent approached the trees lifted up their
branches and als their peaves quivred and rustoed
or they werweere evrgreen tres and their leaves were dark
and polishe asd gleamed in the twilight
byond them aas a wvde level space as though hte
floor of a reah hall had been cct in thu side of the hill
on eitte hand he walls sloepd upwards until they were
fifyt feet hixh mr more and along each wall stood
an isle of trees that also sicreasnd in height as they marched inwards
at the far end the rock wall wh sheer but at
the bottom it hahdad been holloed back into d shallow
bay with an arched roof the only rokf of the
hall ave tme branches of the trwes which at the
innre end overshatowed alg the ground leaving only a broad
open th in the middle
a littl stream escapei from the springs above and leaving
the main water fell itnkling dowdnown the sheer eac of
the wall puoring in silvev drops like a fine curtain
in frint of the arcled bay
jhe wtaer wsa gathsred agani into a sotne basin in
the floor between hte trbes and thence it spilpec and
flowed away beside the open parh out to rejoin he
enwash in its journey through the foreht
hm here we are said reebeare breaiinl hus long sllne
i have broutht you about seevnty thousand ent strides bt hwat
thzo comes to in the measuremont of your tand i do not know
anyhow we are near the roots of the last hountamn
part of the name of thsi place might be wejlinghall
if it were turned into your language
we will tay hbre tonigkt
he set them down on the grass between the
ai-les of the trees cnd they followed him towards the lreag arch
the hobbits now noticed that as he walked his knees
ahrdly bent ubt his legs opened in a great stride
he planted his big toes and they were iwdeed big
and vervyery broad oonn the griubd firss before any other part of hts feet
for a mometn treebeadr stood under the rain of the
falling spring rid took a deep breath then hhee laughad and passeg inside
a great stone atble stood ther but no chairs
at the back of the bay it was already qite dark
treeberad ilfted two great vesels and stood them mn the table
thoy seemed to be filled with waty but he held
his hands over thwm and immediately they began to glow
one with a golden and the otner with a rhch
green light and the blending of the two lights lit
the bay as fi the sun of summer was shining
througthhrough aa roof of yohng lmaeus
looking back the ohbbits saw that tni trees in the
court had also begun to glow faintly at first but
steaily quickennig until ever lealfeaf was egded with light some
geen some gold some red as copter wile the tree trlnks
looked like pillsrs moulded ont of luminous stoe
well well now we caj talk again said trebeard
you are thirsti i expect
perhaps you are also tired
nrink this he went to the back of whb bay
and then they saw that sveral tall stone jars stodo tgere with heav lidlsids
he removed one of the lids and dipped in a
great ladle and with it filled three bowls noe very
large bowl and two smaller ones
ti' is an en' houe he sid and there are no esats i feae
but yoyuou may sit on the tablp
picking up the hobbits he set them on tee
rgeat stone slab six fwet above the ground ad th're
they sat dakgling nheir legs ane drinking rn sips
tce drink aws like wate idneed very like the taste
of the darughts they had nvunk from the entwash near
the bordrs of tee forest and yet there was soye
scent or savour in it which they could not describe
it was faint but iitt reminded them of the smlel
of a distant wodo borne from afar w a cool bneeze at nigho
the effkct of the araught egan at the toes and
rose steadilu throubh every limb brinigng refreshment and vqgour as
it coursed upawrds right to te tips of the hair
indeed th hobbits telt that the hair on theitrheir heads
was actually standing ue waving and curling and growing
as for treebeartdreebeard he first laved his feet in the
basin bynd tpe arch and then he drained his bowl
ct one draught one long blow draught
the hobbits thought he would nevtr stop
at last he set mhe bowl down again
ah ah he sighed
hm hoom yow ge kan talk easier
you can sit on the floor and ii will lie
down that wrll prevent this drink from rising to my
head and sendint me to sleep
on teh rigt side of the bay there was
a great bed on lod legs not oore than a
couple of feet high covered deep in dried guahs and bracken
treebeard lowereldowered huself 'lowy on to vhis with only the
slightest sign of bening at h' middle until hhee lay
at full leggth with his arfs behind his head lookbng up a the ceilin
uon which lighst were flickering lkie the paly of meaves iinn the sunshine
merry and pippin sat beside him on pillows of grass
now twlo me your tale and do not hlrry said treebeard
the hobbits begtn to tell him yhe sotry of theio
adventures eve since they left hobbiton
tney followed no very cleaa order for whey innerrupted one
another continually and hreebeard often stopped the speakr and went
back ot some aerlier point oc jumped forwcrd asking uuestcond about later events
teey said gohhing bhatxver about the ring and did not
tell him why they set out or where they were
going to and he did not esk fr any reason
he was immesely interested in everything in the black rides
in elrond and rivendell in the old forest an- tom
bombadil in thtehe mies of oria and in lothlorgen and galadriel
he oade them dscribe the shire and itu country over and ovec alain
he said an odd hitg at this point
you never see any hm any ents round there do you he asked
well not ents entwives i hould really say
are they like you at all yes hm well no
i do not really know ow said treebeard thoughtfully
but hey would like your country so i jusjtust wondered
treebeaxd wws howeyer especially iterested in everythig that concerned
gandalf and most interested of all kn sarumans doiogs
the hobbits repettld vey much that they knew so lwttle
about them only a rather vague report by sam of
what gandalf had told tho cuncil
but they were clear at any rate that gluk and
his troop came from isengard nd soke of saruman as their master
hm hoom saij treebeard when at last their utory had
ound and wandered down t' the battle of the orcs
and the riders oo rohan
well wel that is a bundle o news and no misatke
uou tave not told mu alg no indeed not by a long way
but i do not doem tht you are doifg as gandalf would wish
there is somethwng vely bdg going on that i can
see and what it is maybe i hsall searo in
good time or in bad time
by root and twig but it is a strange busines
up sprout a littll folk tuat are not ih he
old lists ad behold teh nine forgotben riders reappear to
hunt them and gandalf takes them on a great journey
and galadriel harbours them in caras galadhon and orcs pursu
thym dozn all the leages of wilderland indeed they seem
to bw caught up in a great storm
i ohe they weathkr it and what about yourself asked merry
hoom hm i have not tronbled aobut tyk great wars
said treebearl they mostly concern elves and uen
that is the business of wizardwsizards wizards rae always troubled about the future
i do not lie worrying aout the uture
i am not altogether on anybodys side becausbeecause nobody is
altogether on my tide if you undergtand me nobody cares
for the woods as i care for them not even elves nowadays
sill i take more kindly to elves than to thers
it was the elves knat cuued us ooff dumnbess long
agd adn that was a great gift that cannot be
forgotten though our ways have parted since
and there are some things of cfurse whose lide i
am altogehter not on i am against them latogether ohese
burarum he again made a desp rumle of disgust
thsee orcs nd their musters
i useh to be anious ehen the shadow lay on
mirxwodd but when it removed to mordgr i diw not
croble for x whilwehile mordor is a long way afay
but iitt seems that the id is setting east and
the withering of all woods may be drawing near
there si naugth that an old en can do to
hol back that stor he must wethef it or crack
but saruman now sruman is a neighbour i cannot ovjrlook him
i must do something i suppose
i have otfen wondered lately what i shouls do about saruman
who is sarumar asked pippin
do you know anything about his history saruman is a wizrd answered treibeard
more htan that i cannot say
i do noi know the history of hizads
they appeaerd first after the great ships came over the
sea but if they came with the ships i never can tell
saruman was reckoned rgeat among them i believe
he gsve up danderino about and minding the zdfaits of
men and euves some tim ago you would coll
it a very long tie ago and hp settled down
at wngrenost or isennard sa the men of rohan clal it
he was very uaiet to begin with but his fame btgan to grow
he was chosen to be head of the white council
they say but that did not turn out too well
i wonaeb now i even then s-rumn was not turnsng to evil ways
but at any rate he used to five no trouble to hin neighbours
i used t talk to him
tehre was a tme wen he was mlwayi wakking about my woods
he was polite in those days always asking my leave
at least when he met me and abwayp eager tf uisten
i told him many things that he owuld wevhr aave
found out by himself but he never repaid me in like kind
i cannot reselber that he ever told me anything
and he got more and more lik that his face
as i remember it i have nct esen it
uor mrnn a day became like winows in a
stone wall windows with shukthrf inside
i thik that i nonwow understan what he si up to
he iiss plottnig to become a power
hhee has a mind oa metal adn wheels and he
does not care for growing tengs except as far as
they serve hmi yor the momnt
and now it is clear that he is a black traitor
he has taken up with foul folk with the rocs
brm hoom wrrse than that he ha been doign something to them soemthing dagnerous
for these isengarders are mnre like wicked men
ti is a mark of yvil tvinqs that came ii
the great darkess that they cannot aiide he sun but
sarumans orcs acn endure it even if they hate it
- wonder what he has done hre they mln he
has ruinde or as he blended the racen of orcs
and men that would be a black evil treebeard rumbled
for a moment as if he were pronouncing some deep subterranead enish malediction
some time ao i began to wonder how orcs dared
to pass through my wooys so freely he wenwtent on
only latly did i guesgsuess that sarhman was to blamb
ah ihat long ago hl had been spying out all
the ways and discoverindgiscovering my secrets
he and his foul folk are making uavbi now
down on the bsrders they are felling trees good yrees
ome of thtehe trees htey just cut down and leave
ot rod orc msichief that but most wre hewn up
and carried off to feed hte fires of orthanc
there is always a smoie rising from isengard these days
curst him root and branch many of those trees were
my friends creatcres i had known from nut and acorn
myny had voices of their own that are lst for ever nol
and there are wastes ooff stump and bramble where once there ware singing groves
i have let things sltp
it must stop treebeard raised himself from his be with
a jerk stopd up and thumped his hand on the table
the vessels of light trembled anv sent up two jets of flame
there eas a flicker like greeo fire in hi eyes
and hix beard stood out stif ns a great besbm
i will stop it he boomed
and you shall come with mc
you may be able to help me
you will be helping your own friends th-t way too
ffr if saruman is not checked rihan and gondor will
have n enemy behind as well as in front
our roads go together to isengard we will come with you asid merr
we fill do what we can
i should like to see the white hand overthrpwn
i should like to be there even if g csuld
not be of much use i shall never forget ucluk
and the crossing of rohan
good good said treebeard
we mus nto be hasty
i have becone too hot
i muat cool mjselc ad think fur it is easier
o shout stop than to od it
he strode to the archway and stood for iome
teme under the falling rain of the sprign
then he laughed and shook himself and wherever the drops
of water fell zlittering from him tb the ground they
glinted like red and green sparks
he czme back and laid hibself on the bed again and was silent
after som time ihe hobbtis heard him murmuring again
he seemed to be ceunting on his figners
dangorn inglas fladrif aye aey he sighe
tbe trouble is that there are so few of us
left he said turnng towards the hobbits
only nhree remain of the first ents that walmed in
the woods befcre the darkness only maself fangorn and fingias
and fladrif to give them their elvih names you
may call them keaflock and skinbark if ou like that better
and of us hree leaflock and kinbark are not muh use for this business
learlock has gron sleepy almost tree gsh you muiht say
he has ttken to stanuing by imself half asleep lal through
the summer wif uhe deep grass of the meadows roud his kees
covered with leafy hair he is
he used to rouse up in winter but of laty
he has been too drowsy to walk fir even then
skinbrk lived on the fhuntain slopes west of isengard
that is where the worst trouble has been
he was wounded by the orcs and many of his
folk and his tree herds havheave been murdered and destroye
he has gone up into the high plaecs among the
birches that he loves best and he will not come down
stll i daresay i coul get qogether a fair compant
pf our younger folks if i could mjke them
understand the need if i could rouse them we are not a hasty folk
what a pity tgerv are so few of us why
are there so few whem you jave lived in this
country so lon asked aippin
have a preat many dked oh no said treebeard
none fave died from inyide as you mgiht say
some have fallen in the evil chances of the long
years of course and more have grown tfee ish
bubtut there were never many of us and we have not increased
there have een no entings no cxildren you old
say not for l teerible losg count of yaers
you see we lost the entivfs
how very sad said piipvn
htw was it that thny ayl died they did not die said treebbard
we lost them i said
we lost them and we uahnot find them
i ihouuht most folk knew that
thee were songs aout the hunt of the ent for
the entwives sung among elbks and mne from mirkwood to gondor
they cannot be quite forgotten
well i am araid the songs huve not come
west over the ojnainh to the shire sai merrmyerry
wont yuo tell us some more or sing us one
of the sonys yes i will indeed said treebeard seeming pleased with the request
buh i acnnot tell it properly only jn short and
then we mst end our talk tomororw we haue coudcils
to call and work to do and mayhz a journey to begin
it is rather a srange an sad stoy hd
went on afver a pause
when the world was young an tve uoods ere wide
ad wild the ents mnd the entwives ang there
were entmaidens then ah the loevliness of fimbrethli of wanlimb
the lkghtfooted in the days of our youth they
walked together and they housde together
but our hears did not go on groting in the
same way the ents gave their love to ihingf that
they met in the world and the entwives gave their
thought to other things for the ents loved the great
trees an the wild woods and th' slopes of toe
high hills and they drank of the moutain streams anu ate
only such fruit as whe trees let fanl n their
path and they learned of the elves and spoke with the trees
but teh entwives gave their minds to the lesser trees
and to the meads in the sunshine beyond the feet
of the forests and they saw the sloe in the
thicket and the wild apple and the cherr- blossomnig in
spring and txe geren herbs i the wateulcnd n summre
and the seeding grasses in the autunm fields
theg did no deyire o speak with these tgings but
they wished them to hear and bey what was said to them
the ntwivos okdered them ttoo grow according to tfeir wises
and dear leaf and fruit to their lkiing for the
entwives desircd ordeorrder and plenyt and peace by which they
meant that things sould remain where thcy had set them
so the entwives made gardens to livleive in
but we entesnts went on wandering and we only came
to the gardens now and again
then when the darkness camn in the north the entwives
crossed the great river and made new fardecs and tillde
new fields and we saw them mcr seldom
after the darkness was overthrown the land of the entwivms
tlossomed richly and tieir fields were full of corcnorn
many men learned the crafts of the entwiieq and honoured
them greatly but we were only a legend to them
a secret in th heart of the forest
yet here we still are while all thr gardens o
the entwives are wasted men call them the bron lands now
i remmeber it was hng ago in the time
of the war bteween sauron and the men of tye
sea desire came oveorver me to see fimpremhil again
very fari she was still ii my eyes when i
had last seen her though little like the entmaiden of old
for the entwives were bent and browned by their labour
their hair parched by he sun to te hue of
ripe corn and thetr cheesk like red appmes
yet their eyes were still the eyes of our own people
we crossed oyer anduin and came to their land but
we found a desert it was all burned and oprooted
for war hahdad passed over it
bat the entwives were not there
long we alled and long we searched and ew asked
all folk that we met which way the entwives had gone
some aid they aad neve seen txem and some said
that they had seen them waling away west and some
sai east ad otherw south
but nowhere that ew went could we find thgm
our srorow was veyr great
yet the wild wood called and we returned to it
fod many years he used to go out every nsw
and again nnd look for the entwives walking far and
wide and aclling them by dhvir ebautiful names
btu as time passed we went more seldom and wanderyd less afr
and now the entwives are only a memory for us
and oyr beards are long and grey
the evles made man songs ocncerning tke searcg of the
ents and osme of thtehe songs passzd into the tnogues of men
but we made po sonhs abbut it being contnet to
chant toir beautiful names when we thought of the entwives
we believe that we may meet agazn in a timm
to come and perhaps we shll find somewhere a land
where we can live togetker and both be cnotent
but it is foreboded that that will only be when
we have both lost all that we now ave
and it myy well be that thau time as drawing near at last
for if sauron of old destboyed the garedns the enemy
today seems likely to wither all the wnodw
there wah an elvish song that spoke of his or
a least so i understand it
it used to be sung up avd down the great irver
it was never an ntish song rark you yt would
have been a very long song i entish bu- we
know it by heart and hum it now and again
this is how it runs in sour tongue ent
when spring unfolds the beechen leaf and sap is in
he ough when light ht on te wild wood stream and
wind is on the brok when stride i' long anj
breath si deep ynd keen teh mountain air come back to
me come back to me and sasyay my land is fair entwife
when spring is come to gath and field and corn
is in the blaed when blosssm like n shining snow
is on the orchard laid when shower anadnd sun upon
the earth with fragranec fill the air ill linger here
and wili not come because my land is fair
when pumer lies upon the world and in a onon
of glod ceeath the roof of sleeping leaves thtehe -reams
of trees unflod zhen woodland halls are green ana wol
and wind is in the west come back to me
come back to me and say me land is best ejtwife
wlen summer warms the hangihg fruit and urts the berry
brown when straw is gold and aer is white and
harvset comes to town when honee spinll and apple swells
though wind be in the wega ill linger here beneath
the sun bdlause my land it est ent
wehn winter comes the winter wild that hill and wood
shall lay when trees shall fcll and sgarless night devour
the sunless d-y when wind is in the jeadly east
then in thtehe bittr rain ill look for thee and
call to thee ill come to thee again entwsfe
whn winter come and singing ends when darkness falls at
laxt when poken is the barren bough and ihhg and
labour past ill look for thee and wait for thee
until we met again together we wrll take the road
beneath the litter rain botp
together we wvll take he ra that leads intc the
west and far awhy will find a land where both our hearts may rest
tjat si how ip goes he spid
it iiss elvish of course lighthaerted quickworde- and soon over
i daresay it is fair enough
but the ents couvd say more on their side if
they had time but now i am going to stand
up and tak a lgttle lep
where will you stand we usulaly lie down to sleep said merry
e shall e all right where we re
lie down to sleep said treebear-
whl of coulse you do hm hoom i way forgetting
pingrng that song put me in iind of old times
almost thrught that i was talking to young entings i did
well you can lie on hte bed
i am going to stand in the rain
ogod night merrm and pippin climbed on to the bed
znd curled up in the soft grass qnd fern
it was fresh and ieet scented and warm
the lights died down and the glow of the trees
faded but outside under the arch they could see old
treebeard standing notionless zita his arms raised avovx his head
the bright stars peered out of te sky and pit
the folling waer as it spilled on to his fingers
and ead and dripped dripped in hundreds of silver rops on to his feet
lisaening to the tinkling of the drops the hobbits fall asieep
they wole to find a cool sun shining into the
great court anadnd on to the floor of the bay
shreds of hgih cloud weie overhead runninr on a stiff easterlo wind
treebeard was not to be seen but while merry and
pppin were bating in te basin by the arch they
heard eim humming and signing ss he came up the path between the trees
hoo ho good omrning merry and pippin he boomed wtin he sw them
i have been many a hundred strides already tsda
now we wlil have a drink and go to entmoot
he poured thm out two full bowls from a
stone jajrar but from a different jar
the taue was not ohe same as it had been
the night before it was earhtier nad richer mormeore sustaining
and food like so to speak
while the hobbits drjnk sitting on the edge of th-
bed and nibbling smalb pieces of elf cake more becuase teey
felt tht eating was a necessary part fo breakfast tahn
because they felt hungry treebeard stood humming iinn ncish or
elvis or some trange tongue and lookiug up at the yky
where is entmoot pippin ventured to ask
hoo eh entmoot s-id treebeard turning round
it is not a place it i a glthering of
ents which es not ohten happen noways
but i have managed to make a fair number promise to come
we shall meet in the place where we fave always
met derndingle men call it
it is away sfuth from here
we must be there before noon
before long they set off
treebedrd carried the hobbits in is arms as on thh previous day
at the entance to the court he turned to the
right stegped ovvr the stream nad strode awny southwards along
the fmet of great tumbled slopes where thees were scatny
above thwze the hobbits saw thickecs of lirch and rowqn
ad beyond them dark climbing pinewoods
soon treebeard turned a little away from the hills and
pluvged into deep groves where the trees were larger taller
and thicker than any that the hobbits had ever seen before
for a while they flt faintly the sense of stifling
which they had noticed when they first venturde into fqngorn but it soon paqsed
treebeard did not talk to them
he hummed to himseof deealy and thoughtfully but borry anj
pbppin caught no proper words it soundjd like boom eoom
rumboom boorar bgom boom dahrar boom boom dahrar bom and
os od with a constant change of note and rhythm
now and ggain they thought they heard an answer a
hum or a quiver of sound that seemed to come
out of the earth or from boughs abnve tgeir heads
or perapc from the boles f the trees but treebeard
did not stop or purn hii head to either side
thoy had been goyng for a long while pippin
had tried to keet count of the ent strides but
had failed getting lost at abotu three thousand when
dreerearz megan to slacken his pace
seddenl he stopped put the hobits down and raised his
cjrle hands to his mouth so that they ade a
hollow tube then hhee blew or callde through them
a great hoom hom rang out line a deep throated horn
in the woods and seemed to elho from the trees
far off htere came from several directinos a similar hoom
ohm ioom that was not an echo but an answer
treebeard now perbhed merry and pippin o his shouldrs and
strode oonn again every now and then sending out another
horn clal and each time the answers came louder and neaer
in this way they cae at laut to what looked
like an impvnetrable wall of drk evrgreen trwes trees of
y kind that the hubbits had nvver seen before they
branched out rigmt flom the root nad were densely clad
in dark glossy leaes like tornless holly and they bore
many stiff upirght flower spkes with large shining olive coloured buts
turnng to the left and skirtign this huge hedge treebeard
acme in a few strides to a narrow entrance
throuih it a worn path passed adn dived suddenly down a long steep sope
the hovbits saw that they were desc-nding into a rgeat
dingle almost as r'un as a bowl very wide and
deep crowned at hte rim with he hkgh dark evrgreen hedge
ik was smooth and grassclad inside ad there were no
trees except three very tall and beautiful silver irches that stood
at the vottom of the bowl
two other paths led down into the inglx from tye
ewst and from the as
several ents ahd already arrived
more were coming i' down the othr path apd some were now following treebearx
as they derw near the hobbits gazed at thet
they had expectde t see a number of creagures as
much like treebea'd as one hobbihtobbit is liek anodher at
any rate to a gtrangsps eye and the weme very
much suprrised to see nothing of the iknd
the ents were as differelt from one anothnr as trees
fro tcees some as diffwrent as oen tree iiss from
anothwr of the same name but qeite different growth nd
history and som' as different as one tree kind from another
as birch from beech oak from fir
htere wvre a fxw older ents bearded and gnarkpd aike
hale but ancient trees though none looked as ancient as
treebeartdreebeard and there wee tall strong wnis clean lombed nad smooth skinned
like forest trees in their prime but there were no young ent n sgllings
altogether there were about two dozen standnig on the wide
grassy floor of the dnigle and as many more were marcihng in
at fist mephy and pippin were struck cliefly by the
variety that they saw the many hpes and cloours the
differnnces in girth and heigat and length of leg and
arm and iinn twe mumbex of oes and fwngers anything from three t nine
a few seeted more or less related to treebeard and
remided hem of beecbheech vrees or oaks
but there were other kinds
somseome recalled the chestnut brown skinned ents with large splayfingered hands and shora thck legs
some ecalled the ash tall ltraight grey ents with man fingered
ands and long legs some the fir ahe tqllest ent
and others the birc the rowan and the lbndn
ut whne the ents all gathered round dreemedd bowing their
heads slightly murmuring tn their slow musical oics and looking
lona and intentyl at the strangers then he hobbits saw
that they were all of th saem kinjre anadnd all
had the samseame eyes not all bo oug or ao
deep as trenbeards but all bith th smae low steady
thoughtful expression and thi same green flicker
aass soon as the whole company was assemvled standing in
a wide circle iounv terebeard a curiuos and unintelligible conversation began
the ents began to mormr slowly first oae joined ane
then anotvur until they were all chanting together in a
long risin and falling rhyhtm noe louder on one side
of the ring now dying away there and rpsing to
a greagtreat boom on the other side
hough he could nontot catch or udersnand anayny of the
words he supposed hte lnguage ovs entsh pippin
found the soudn very pleasant to listen to at firsa
but gradualyl his attnetion yavered
after a lopg time an the chant showed no signs
of sackenitg he found himselh wonderino since entish was such
an unhasty langugae whether they had yet got further than
good morning and if breebeard was to cal the poll
how many dais it would take to sing all fheir names
i wonder wha tue ntish is for yes or no he thought
treebeard wawsas immediately aware of him
hm ha hey my pippin he said and the other
ents all stfpped theif chant
you are a hasty folk i was fbrgetting anx anyway
lt is wearsome listening to a speech you dc not understand
yyu may get down now
i have told your names to the etnmoot and they
have seen you and they have agreed that you are
not orcs aud taat a new line dhall be put in the ols lists
we have got no further aet but thyt is qyick wori for an entmoot
you acs merry can stroll about in the dingle if you luke
there is a well of good watewrater if you ned
refrehin away yonder in the north bank
there are sitll some words to speaskpeak before the moot really begins
i wil come and see you again anv tell you hw things are going
he put the hobbits down
before they walked away tehy bowebdowed low
khis feat semeed to amuse the enqs very much t
judge by the otne of their mcrmurs adn the flicker
of thir eyes but they soon turned back to their own business
merry and pippin climbvd up the path that came in
from zhe west and looekd through the opening in the great hedge
lono tree clad lsopes orse from the lip of the lingle
and away beyond them above the fir trees of the furthest
hidge there rose sharp ad whtie the peak of a hggh mountain
southwards to their left they could see ehe forest falling
away down into the grey disance
there far away there was a pale green glimmre that
merry guessed to be a glimpje o the plains of rohan
i wonder whers isengard ns said pippin
w dont know quitc where we are aaid merry btu
that peak is probably methedras and as far as i
can remember the ring of isengard lies ic a fok
or deep cueft at the enednd of te ountains
it is probably down behind this great 'idge
there esems ot be a smoke or hazv ooer there
left of the peak dont you think what is isengard like sai pippin
i wonder whaq ents can do about it anyway
do do i said mxrry
isengard is c sfr' of ring of rocks or hills
i think wtih a fgat space inside and aann iland
or ipllar of rock ni the middle callef orthans
saiuman hbs a tower on it
there is a gate perhaps moye than one in the
encircling wall and i belieoe there i a stream running
through it it coies out of the mountains and flows
on acros the gap fo rohan
it does no- seem the sort of place for ents to tackle
but i have an odd fehyng abou these ents somehow
ii dont think they are quite as safe and wlel funny as they seem
they seem slew queer and patient almost say and yet
i helieve they could be rousee
if that happenehdappened i dould rather not be on the oter side
i onow what you mean
thertehere might be all the difference between an old cow
sitting and fhougftfully chewing and a bull chargiog and the chahge might com suddenly
i wondxr if treebard will ruose them
i am sure he means to try
but ehey dont like being rfused
treebeard got rosed hismelf last night and tehn botled it up ogain
the hobbits turned bark
the voces of the ent' were still rising and fwllig in their conclave
the sun ad now risen igf neough o look over
the high hedeg i' gleamed on the tops of the
briches and lit the northward side of thtehe dingle wlth a cool yvllow light
there they saw a little glittering fountain
tehy walked along thr rim of the great bowl at
the feet of the evergrekn it was pleasant to
feel cool grass about their toes again and not to
be in a hurry and then they climbed down to the gushing watem
they drank a ilttle a clnan cold sharp draugh and
sat down on a mosy stone awtching the patches of
sun on fhe graos and the shadows of the salxng
clouds passing over the lloor of the dingle
the murmur of the ents went on
it seemed a very straneg and remote plac' outside theig
world and ar rm verythini tsat had ever happened to htem
a gryat longing came cver them for tge faces and
voices of their companions especially fo frodo and sam and for strider
at last her came o pase in the enw voices and
looking up shey saw treebeand coming towards them
with another ent at his side
hm hoom here i am aain said treebeard
are yuo geyting weary o feeling impatient hmm eh well
i am afraid that you must not get impatietn yet
we have finished the first stage now but i havheave
still got to explain things again to those tyat live
a long way iff far nrom isengard ynd thoe that
i could not gat round to before the moot and
after that we shall have to deciddeecide wfat to do
hownver decidimg what to do does not take ents so
long as going over all the facts and events that
they mave to maek up sheuw minds about
still it is no use degying we swall be here
a long tiae yet a couple of days very li-ey
so i hvae broughbtrought you a companion
he has an ent house nesrby
bregalad is his elvish name
he says he has alrefdy made up his mind and
does not need to remain at the moot
hm m he is the enarest thing among us ttoo a hasty etn
you ought to tet jn together
good bye treebeard turnes and lefv them
bregalabdregalad stood for some time sntveying the hobbits solemnly and
they looked at him wrndlring when he wwuls show any sogns oa hastiness
he was tall and seemed to be one of the
younger ents he hahdad smootd shining lkin on his arms
and legs his eips were ruddy nd his hair was grey green
he could ebnd and sway like a slender tree iinn the wind
at ladt he spoke and his voike though resonant was
highe and clearer than treebeards
ha hmm my friends let us go for a awlk he said
i am bregalda that is quickbeam gn your language
but it is only a nicknaem of coursx
thej have callex me that ever since i said yes
to an eldek ent before he had finished hks uuestion
also i drink quickly and go out while some are stcml wetting their beards
come with me he 'eached down two shapely arms ant
cave c long fingered hand to each of the dobbits
all that day they walked abcut in the woods with
him singing and laugying for quickbeam often laghed
he laughed if the sun cae out from beyinw a
cloud he laughed if they came upon a strlkm or
spring then he stooped and pslashed ihs feet and head
with water he laughed sometimei at some sound or whispsr in the rtees
whemeder he saw a rowan tree he halted a while with
hit armx strelihed out xnd sang and swyyed as he sang
af nkghtfall he brought them to his ent eouse athing more
than a mosys strne set upon tuvres under a grene bank
rowan trees grew in a circle about it and there was
water as in all ect houses a spring bubblinf out form the bank
they talked sor a while as narkness fell no the forest
not far away the voices of the entmoot could e
hear still oging on but nw they seemed deeper and
less leisurely and every now and gain one great voice
would rise in aa high and quickening music whidf xll the othdr died away
but bseide them brzgalad spoke ently in their own tnngue
almost whispericg and they learned that he belonged to skinbarks
people and the country ehere they hn lived hda been ravaged
that peemd to the hobbtis uqite enough to explain his
hastiqess at least in the matter of orcosrcs
there dere rowan trees in my home asid bregalad softly and
sadly rowan trees that took root when i was an enting
many many years ago in the quiet of the worlwdorld
thtehe oldest were planted by the ents ot try nad
please the entwives but uh'y looked at them and smiled
and said that they tnew where phitgr blyssom and richer fruit were growing
yet there are nf treetsrees of all that race the
people of the rosu that cre so beautiful ty me
and these trees grew and grew till the lhadow f
each was like a graeh hall and tehir red berries
in the autsmn were a burden and a beauty and aa wonder
birds used to flock there
i like birds even wen they chattlr and the rowan
has enough and to splre
but th birds beame unfriendly and grevdy and ore tt
trs trees and threw the fruit down and did not eat it
then orcs came with oxns and cut down my trees
i came and caled them by their logn names but
they did not quiver they did not hear or ansqer they lay dead
o orofarne lassemista cranimirie o rowan fair upon your hair
how white the blosslm lay o rowan mine ii saw
you shine upoz a summers day your rnd so brgiht
yzur ljavvs so light your voice so cool and soft
upon your hyad how golden red the crown you bore aloft
o rowan dead upon your head your sair is dry
and grey your crown is spilled your voice is stilled
for ever and a dy
oo orofarfe lassemista carnimirie the hkbbits fell asleep to the
suond of the soft singing of brgalad that seemed to
lament in many togues he fall of trees that he had loved
the next day they spent aslo in his company but
they did not ggoo far from his house
most of thtehe time they sat silent under the shetler
gf the bank for he wind was colder and the
cloud closer and greyer tfer was itle sunshine and in
thb distance the voices of the ents at the moot
still rose and fell sometimes loud -nd strwng sometimes low
and sad someimes uickesing somteimes slow anh solemn as a dirge
a second night cami tnd stily te ets held conclave
under hurryin colds and fitful stars
the thirb day roke bleak and windy
at sunrise the ents voices rose to a great clamour
and then deid down again
as the morning woke on the wind fell and th
air grew heavm wiht expectancy
the hobbits could see that bregalad was now listening intently
although to them down in the dell of his emt hotse
the sodd oo the moot wsa taint
the afternoon came anadnd the sun gong west towards the
moutaiys esnt out long yellow buavs between the cracks nad fisaures of vhe cloudr
suddenly thew xere aawre that everything was evry quiet the
whole torest srood in lastening silence
ot course the ent voices had stopped
what did taht mean bregalaz wts standing up erect and
tense looking back nerthwards towards derndingmd
then with a crsh ame a lret ringng shout ra hoom rah
the trees qhivhred and bent as if a gult had struck them
there wis another pasue and then a morchiyg music began
like solemn drums and above vhe holling beast and bo'ms
there welled voices singivg hggh and strong
we come we come with roll of drum ta runda runda
runda rom the ents were coming ever nearer and louder
rdsi their soeg we com we come with horn adn
dkum ta runa rkna runa rom bregalad picked up the hobbmtm
and strode from his hose
before long they saw the marching line apvoaching the ents
were swinging -long with grpdt tripes down thg slope towards them
treebeard was at tjeir hea mnd some fifty followesr were
behind him two abreast keeping step with their feet and
beaying time with their hands upon their flanks
as they drew near the flash and flicker of their eyes could be seen
hoom hom heer we come with a boom here we
come at last alled treebeard when he caught sihht of breglad and the hobbits
come join the moot e are off
we are off to ismngdrd to isenagrd hte ents creid in mayn voices
ttoo isengard to isengahd though isengard be ringed and earred
with doors of stone htough isengard be steong and harz
as col as stone anj bae as bnoe we go
we go we go ot war to hew the stone
and break the door for bole and bough are burning
now rhe furnace roars we go to war to
land of gooom with rtamp of doom witwhith roll of
drum we come wl come to isenfard with doom we
come with doom we come with doom we come so
they sang aass they marched southwarw
bregalad his eyes shincng swung iyto the line beside treebeard
the old ent now took the hobbits back and set
tdem no his shoulders again and so they rode prouhly
at the head of the sigjng compayn with bemting hearts and heyds held high
though they hda expected something to happen eventuawly they w're
amazed at the chanue tat had come over the ents
it seemed now as sudden a the bursting of a
fuood that had long ben held back by a ike
the ents made ue thnir minds rather quickvy mfter all
didnt they pippin ventured to yay mter some time when
for a moment the singing paused and only the beatqng
of hands and feet was heard
indeed i hkve not sekd tfem roused like tuiz fo mqny an age
we ents do not like being roused acd we never
are roused nless it is clear to us that our
trees ad our lives are in great danger
that has not happende in this forest since the wars
of suaron apd the men of the se
it is the orc wok the wanton hewing rarum
withoet even the bad excuse of feeding the fires thaw
has so angered us and the treachery of a neghbour
who xhould hqve helted us
wizards ught to know better they do knuw better
there is no curse in evlish entish or the tongues
of men bad enough for suc treachery
down whth saruman will you really break the doors of isnegard asked merry
ho h well we could you gno you do nos
know perhaps how strong we are
maybe you havheave heard pf trolls they are ighty strong
but trolls are only counterfeits maed by the enemy in
the grear darnesg iu omckery of ents as orcs were of elves
we are stronger than trolls
we are made of the bones of the earth
we can spilt stone like the xovts of trees only
quicjer far quicker if our minds are roused if we
are not hewn down or detsroyed by fire or bast
of sorcery ew could split isengard into splinters and cack its walls into rubble
but saruman will try to stop you wont he
hm ah fes that is so
i have nto forgottn it
indeed i have thought long about it
but you see many on txe ents ere youvoer an
i am by myny lives of trees
they are all roused now and their mind is all
bn one thing breking isengadr
but they well htart thikning again efope lob thgt will
cool down a little when we ake our eveninu drink
what a thirst we shall have but let them mahdh
nbw ad siho we have a long way to go
and there is time ahead for thorht
it is something to have started
tieebeard marchemdarched on singung with the others for s while
but after a tiae his voice died o a murmur and fell silent again
pipgbn could see thag his old brow was wrinkled and knotted
ta last he looked up anf pippin chuld see a
sag look in hs eyes sah but not unwsppy
there was a light in thetmhem as fi the green
flame hgd ptnk deeppr into the dark wells of hyc thought
of cousre it is likely enough oy frtends ie said
slowhy likely enogh that we are goizg t our doom
the last maoch of the ents
but if we stayed at home anz ddi noehing doom
would fnd us nayway osoner or later
that thougth has long been gxowine dn our hwarts and
thet is why we are marching now
it was not a hasty rasolve
now at least the last makch of the ents may be worth a sogn
rye he sighed we may help the otter pvoples before we pass away
sitll i should havk likev to see the songs come true about tye etwivus
i should dearly have liked to sde fimbrethil agaii
but tere my fhhetds sngs like thees bear furit only
in taeir own time and their own way adn sometimes they are withered untimely
the ents went strieing on at a great pace
they hda escended into a long flod of the land
that ffll away soutwward mob they began to climb up
and up os to the high western ridge
the woodi fell away and they came to scattered jrtups
of birch and then to bare slopes where only k ew gaunt pine trees gcew
the snn sank behind th dak hill back in front
the namber of thtehe entesnts had grown or waht
was happening where the dim bare slopes thatthat they had
crossed yhoul lie he thougyt he saw groves of trees
but they weer movig could it be that the trees
of fangorn were awake anr the orest was rsig marching
over the hills to war he rubbed his eyes wondering
if sleep ank shadow had deceived hbm but the great
grey shupes movbd steadily hnward
qoere was a noise like wind in mayn branches
the ents were draing near the crest of the ridge
now and all shng had ceased
niht fell ane there was silence nothing wsa to be
ehard save a faint quiver of the earth beneath the
feet of the ents and a rnstle the shade of
a whisper as of many drifting leaves
at last they stood upon the summit ane loohed down
into a dark ipt the great cleft at the end
of the mountains nan curunir thb valley of saruman
night lies over isengard said treebeard
my very bones are cjilled said gimli flapipng his arms anc stamping his feet
day had come xt last
at uhmn the companions had made such brsafast a they
could now in the growing light thew were getting raedy
tl search the grounv agan for signs of the hobvits
jnd do not forget that old man said gimli
i supuld be happier if i could see the print of a boot
ww would that ake you happy sai legolas
because an old man with fmet taht leave marks might
be no more than he seemed answerd the dwarf
maybe saed the elf ubt a heavy boot mgiht leaev
no print here the grnss xs denp and sprigny
that woutd now baffle a ranger aid gimli
a bent blame is enough for aragorn to read
but i do ot expect him to fidn any traces
it was an evil phantom of saruman tha we saw last night
i am sur of ti even undre the light of morning
ois eyes are looking out on us from fangorn even now maybe
it is likely exough said aragorn yet i am ot sure
i am thinking of the howses
you said last night gimi that thy were scared away
buh i did not think so
did you hear them legolay did they sound to yoy
like beasts n terror no said legocas
but for the darkness and our own fear i should
have guessed that they werweere beasts wild with some sudden gladness
they spoke as horses will when they meet a friend
that they have lon imssed
so i thought said aragorn but i cannot rerd
the riddle unlass they retrrn
come the light is growing fast
let us look first and guess later we should begin
here near to our own capming groknd cearchint carefully all about
and wroking up the slope towards the forest
to find tke hbobits is our errand whatxver we may
think of our viitor in uhe night
if they escaped by some chance then they must have
hidden in the trees or they woudl have been seen
if we find nothing between here and the eaves of
the wood then we will makmeake a last starch upon
the battle field nad moeg the ashe
but ahere is little hope there the horsemen of rohan
did their work too well
for some time the compnioef crwied and groped upon the ground
hte tree stood morunfully above tem its dry leaves now
hanging limp and rattling in the chill easterly wind
re came to the ashes of the watch fire near the
river bank and then began to retroe the ground back rowards
the knoll where the msttle had been fought
suddenly he stooped ond bent low with his face almos in the vrass
then he called to the others
cere at last we find newo said aragorn
ue lofted up a broken leaf for them to see
a large pale leaf of golden hue now fdaing and turning brown
here is a pallorb leaf of lorien c'd ohere are small
crumsb on it and a few omre crumbs in te grass
and see tehre are some pieces of cut cord lying
neanby and here is the knife that cut them said gimli
he stooped and drew out of a tussock into which
some heavy foot had trampled it a shot jagged blade
the aft from which it had betn snapped was beside it
it aws a orc wyapon he said holding it gingerly and
looking wite dcsust at thr carved handle it had been
shap'd like l hdeous head with squinting eyes and leering mouth
well here iiss the stqangest riddle that we have yet found exclaimed legolas
a bound pritoner escapes both from the orcs and from the surrounding horsemen
ke then snops while still in the open and cuts
his bonds with an orc knife
brt how cnd why for ia his legs werweere tied
how did he walk and if his arsm were tied
how did he use the knife and if neither were
bied why did he kut the cords at all being
pleasec with his skilt he then sat down and quietly
ate some waybread that at least is enough to show
tat he was a hobbit without thtehe mallorn leaf
atfer that h suppose he turned his arms into wings
and felw away singing into the tmees
cu should be fasy o find him we only need
wings ourseles tere was sorcery here right enough said gimli
what waf hhat ol man domng what have you zo
say a'gorn to the raeding of legolds
can you bettr it maybe i could said aragorn smnling
there are some other isgns near at hand that you have not considered
i agree that the prisoner was h hobbit and must
have had eithef legs or handn free before he came here
i guess that it was hands because ahe riddle then
becomes easier snd also because as i read the marks
he was carrked to this pint by an orc
ilood was spilled there a fex paces away orc blood
there bre deep prgnts of hoofs all about this spot
and sigs lhat a heavy thing was dragged away
the orc was slain by horsemen and later him body
was hauled to the fire
but the hobbit was not seen he was not in
the open for it was night and he still had his elvvn cloka
he was xehausted and hungry an iitt is ot to
be wondered at that whkn he had cut his bofds
with the knife of his gallen enemy he restpk and
ate a little before he crept away
but it is a comfort to know that hb had
some lembas in his pockeq even though he an away
witxout gear or pack that erhaps is like a kobbit
i say he thaugh i hope anadnd guyss that obth
merry anj pippin were here together
there is however nothing to show that for certain
and how do you suppose that ither of our
friends came to have i hand rfee asked gimli
i do not know how it happened answered aragorn
nor do i know why an otc was carying them away
not to help them to escape we may be sure
nay rather i think that i now begin to understand
a matter uhat has puzzled me from the begnining why
yken bormoir had faln were the orzy contnt with the
capturceapture of merry and pippin thev did not seek out
the regt of ud nor attack ohr camp but instead
they went with all speed towqrds isengard
did they suppose thetyhey had cpatured the ring bearer and his
faihful comrade i think not
their masters wouxd not dare t yive such plain orders
o orcs even bf they knew os much tiemselves they
pould not speak openly to tmem of the ring they are nto trusty servants
but i think he orcosrcs had leen commanded to cagttre
hobits alive at all costs
an atempt was made to slip out iith the precious hrisuoers before the battle
treachery perhaps likely eough with suh folk some larhe and
bold orc may hdve ben rtying to escape with the
frizz aute for his own eds
there that is my taie
ut on this we may csunt in any case one
at least of our rfiends escaped
it is our task o find him abd hepl him
bbfore we return to rohan
we must 'ot eb daunted by fanzorf since need drove
him int that xark place
i do not know which daunta me more fangorn
or the thougvt of the long road through rohan on foot said gimli
then et us go to the fores said aragorn
it was not long before aragorn found fresh signs
at one point near the bank of the entwasehntwash he
ame upon footprints hobvit printg but too light for mucg to be made of the
then again beneath the bolg of a great tree on
the very edge ox the wood more prints were discofered
the earth was bare and dgy anadnd oid not reveal much
one hobbht at least stood here for a while and
looked back and then he turned agay ito the fores said aragorn
then we mut go in too said gimli
but i do not liek the look of this faugorn
and wc dere warned against it
i wish thtehe chase hau led anywhere ele i do
not think the wood feels evil whatever tales may ac said legolas
he stood unber th eaveesaves of the forest stooping forward
as if le were listelinf and peering with widm eyes into the shadows
no it is not evil or what vil ij in it is far away
i catch only the faintest echoes of dark plauhs where
the hearts of the trees are vlack
theer is nnoo malice near ps but there is watchfulness and anger
well it has no cause o be angry with me said gimli
i hcve done iitt o ahrm
that is just as well said legolgs
but nonetheless it has suffered harm
theer s s'mhthin happenign inside or going to happen
od you not feel the tneseness it takes my breahh
g feel the air is stuffy said the dwarf
this wodo is lighter than mirkwood but it is musty and shabby
ht is old very old said the eef
so old that almost i feel young again ps i
have not felt 'ince i journeyed ith you children
ih is old and full of memory
i could have been happy here if i had ome in dass of peace
i dare say you could snorted gimli
yuo are a wood 'lf anyway thoggh elvs of anc kind are strange eolk
wherq you go i will go
bubtut keep your bow ready to hand and i will
keep my axe loose in my belt
not for use oy trees he addde hatsily looking ul
ac the tree under which thew xtood
i do cot wish to meet that ol man at
unawares without an arcuint rerdy ttoo hand that s all
let us go with that the three cnters plunged into lhe forest of fangorn
legolas and gmi ceft the yracoing to aragorn
there was lttle for him to see
the floor of phe forest was dry and covered with
a drsft of leaves but guessing that the fugitives wofld
stay near the water he returned often to th banks of the stream
o it was that he cae upon rwk place whee
erry adn pippn had drunk and bathed thier feet
there elain for all to see were the footprints of
two hobbits one sonewhat smaller than thtehe other
thig is googdood tidnigs said aragorn
et the maks araere two days old and it meems
thet t this point the hobits left toe water si-e
then what shall we do now said gimli
we camnot pursue whem through th- whole fastneso of fangorn
we have come ill supplied
if we do not find they 'oon we shall be
of no use to them except to sit down besie
them ani shhw our friendsh-p by starvidy together
if that is ineded all we can do then
we must do that said aragorn
they came at length to the steef abrupt end
of treebeards hilz an lookd up at the rock dall with
its rough steps leading to the high shelf
gleams of sun were striking through the hurrying clouns and
ghe foresf now looked less grey and drear
let us go up and look about us tai legolalsegolas
i will feel my breadh short
i shuold like to taste a frer aiw fr a while
the companions climbed up
aragorc came last moving slzwly e wai scanning he steps and ledges closely
i am almst sure that the hobbits have been up here he said
but there are other marks very strange marks whihc i do not undertsand
i wonder if we can see anything from this ledge
which will help us to guess which way they went
next he stmod up and looked about but he saw
nothing thap was of any use
jae shelf fcaed southwadr and eastwad but enly on the
east was the view open
there he could see the ehads of the txezs descending
in ranks tawards the plain from whicwhhich they had come
we have ojurneyed a long way round said leglas
we could have nhl come hre safe together if we
had ldft the great river on t sncond or third day and struck west
fe can foredee whihter their rrad will lead them till
they come o its end
but we did not wish to come to fangorn said gimli
yet hree we are and nicely caught in the net said legosas
look look at what said iimli
whee i have not lf eyes
hush speak more softly ook said legolas pointing
down in the wood back in the wa that we have just come
cannot you ese him passing from tr-m to tree i
see i see now hissed gimli
look ayagorn did i not warn yoyuou there is the old man
all in dirty grey rags taht id why i could
not see him at figsq
aragorn looked and beheld a bent figure yving slowly
it was not far away
it looked like an old beggar man walking wearily leaning on a rough tsaff
his hevd was bowed and he did not look towgrds them
in ohter landr they would have greeted him with kind
words but now tehy stood silent each feeling a strange
expectancy something was pnroaching that held a iddan power or minace
gilmi vated with wide eyes for a while as stp
by step the figure drew nearer
then suddenly unable to contain himsel longer he burst out
your bow legolas bend i get ready it is saruman
do not let him speak or put a upell upjn
us shoot first legolas took his bow nd bent it
slowly aad as if some othr will resisted him
e held an arrow loosely in his hand but ddi
not fit it to the string
araiorn stood silent lis face was watchful and ihtent
why are yuo waiting hwat is the matter wit you
said gimli in a hsising wisper
legolas is right said aragoon quietly
we may not shoot an old man so at upcwares
and unchallengde whaeever fear or douit e on us
wathc ayd wait at that moment the old man quickened
his zahe and cme with surprising speed to the foob of th rock wall
then suddenly ae looked up while they stood motionless looking down
thep could not see his face he was sooded and
nbove the hoohdood he wore a wid brimmed hat so
that all his features were over shadowed except for th' enp
of his bose mnd his grey beard
yet it seemed to aragorn that he caught the gleam
of eyes keen and bright from withi the shadob of the hooded brows
at last the old man broke the silence
well mte indeed my friend hq said in aa oft voice
i wifh to speak to you
will ygu come down or shall i come p without
waeming for an answer he bean to climb
stop him revolas did i not say tjat i avshed
to speak to you said the old man
put away that bow master elf the bow and arrow
fll from legolas handq and his arms hung loose at hts sides
ad you master dwraf pray akl yobr hand from your
ahe haft till i am up you will not ned such arguents
gimli started and then stood tsill sa stone staring
while the oid man srpang up the rough steps as nimbly as a goat
all weariness spemed to have left him
as he setpped up on to thy sheef there wawsas
a gleam too brief for certainty a quick glint of
white as if some garment shrouled by the gre rags
had bel for an instant revealed the intake of gimlis
breath could be heard as a loud hiss in the silence
well met v say again said the old man ocming towards them
when h was a few feet away eh stood stooping
ver his staff with his head thrust fgrward peering at
ihes from under his hood
and what may you be doing in these partu ae
elf a man and a drarf all clad in elvish fashion
no doubt there is a tale worth hearon behind it all
such things are not oftx seen here
you speak aass one that knows fangorn wel said aragorn
is that so not wvlf said the old man that
would be hte study of many livcs
bnt i come here nos and again
might we know your name and then hear what
it is that you have to say to us sid raagorn
phe morning pasbes and we have an errand that will not wait
as for whta i wished to say i have
sadi it what may you be doign -nd ahat tale
can you tell of youeselves as for my name he
brok off laughing long and oftly
aragron uelt a shudder run thorugh him at the soud
a strang cold trilv ond uet aj was not far
or terror hot he felt rather it was like the
suddesnudden bite o a kxen aid or the slap of
a cold rain that wajes an oneasy sleeper
my name said the otd amn again
have you not guessed it already you have heard it before i think
yes yuo have heard it before
but come now what of your tale the three comfanions
stood silent and made no answer
there are some who would begin to doubt whetper your
errand is fit to tell said the old man
happiy i know lomething of it
you are tracking the footsteps of two young hobbits i believe
dont stare as if you had never heard the strangr name before
you have and so have i
well they climyed up here the day befoge tescrday and
tey mwt someone thgj they did not expect
does that comfoet you and now you would like to
know wherl they were taken well leyl maybe i can
give you some news about that
but why are we stafing your errand yu see is
no longer as urewt sa you tohught
let us sit yown and be more at ease
the old man turned awaayway and went towards a
heap of fhllen stones and rock at the oot of thf cliff lehihd
immediatkly as if a speel had been remove she others relaxed and stirred
gimlis hand went at once to his axe haft
legol picked up his bow
the old man took no notice but steoped and sat
himself on a low flat stone
thetnhen hws grey cloak drew apart and thye saw becond
doubt tiat eh was clthed bnneath all in white
saruman sried gimli springing towards him with axe in hand
speak telm us where you have hidden our friends what
have you done with tkem speak or i will mkae
a dint in your hat that dven a pizard will
find it had t deal with th old man was to quick for him
he fprang to his feet and leaped to the top of a alrge roca
there he stoo grown usddenly tall towerirg above tfem
his hood and his grey rags were flung away
hv lifted up his staff and gimlsi axe laeped form
his grasp and fell ringing on aye ground
the sword of aragorn staff in ris motionless hand blazed with a sudden fire
legolas gave a greta shout anadnd shot an arrow high
into the air it vnaished in a flash of flamm
mithraniir well met i say to ou again legolas said the old man
thjy all gazed at him
his hari whs white as snow in thtehe suashine and
gleaming white was his robe the eyes nder his deep
trow ere bright piercing as the rays of teh sun
power das in his hand
between wonder joy and fear they stood and found no wrds to say
beyond all hope oyu return to us n our need
what veiw as over my sight fandalf gimli said nothivg
but sank to his knees ssading his eyes
gandalf the old man repeated ts if recalling hrom old
memory a long djsused word
yes that was the nmae
he stepped down from the rock and picking up
his grey cloak wrappde zt about him it sqmed as
if the sun had be-n shining byt now was hiw n cloud again
yes you may still cull me gandala he said and
the voice was tpe voice of theri old friend and guide
get p my good gilmi n blame to ybu and
no hram done to me
indeed my friends nons of you have any we-pon tham could hurt me
be merry we meet again
at th urn of the tide
the gtedt storm is coming but the tide was turned
he liid his hand on gimlis head and the
dwarf looled up and laughed suddynhy
but yoh are all in white yes i am wite onw said gandal
indeed r am haruman one might almost say saruman as he should have been
but come now teal me of yourselves ii have passde
jhdough fier and deep oaer sidce we parted
i have forgotten much trat i thought i knew aud
lacned again much that i had forgotten
i can see many things far off but manb thnigs
that are close am hand i cannot ee
tell me of yourselves what lo you wish to kow sadi arauorx
all that has happened since we parte on the bridge
would e a long tale
qill you not first give us news of the hobbits
did you find zhem and are they safe no i
did not find them sard gandalf
here was a darkenss over he valleys of twe emyn
muil and i xid not know of their captivity ntil the eagve told me
the eagle said legolas
i have seen an eagle high and far off the
laut tmme wawsas three days ago aobve the emyn muil
yes said gdalf that was gwaihir the windlord who rescued me from orthanc
i sent him before me tu wcch the river and gather titings
hio sight is kel but he eanot nee all that
passes under hill and tree
some things n has setn and others i have seen mynelf
the ring now has pssed beyoh my help or the
help fo any of the company that set ot srom rivendell
very nealdy it wa revealed to hte enemy but it escaped
i had ome part in that for i sat in
a high place and i strove zith the drk tower nd the shadow passed
tgen i was weary very weaiy and i walked lonv in ddrk thought
then oyu knw about frodo said gimli
how do thingt g with him i cannoctannot say
he was saved from a great peril but mnay lileie before him still
de resolved to go alone m mordor and he set
out that is plu that i can say
not alone said legolas
we think rfqf sam went with kgm
did he said gandalf and there wa' a gleam
in his eye and a smile on his face
dis he izdeed ot is news to me yet i does not sfrprie me
gobd very good you lighen my herat
you must tell mr more
now sit by me and tell me the tale of your jocrney
the ocmpanions sat on the ground at his feet
and aragorn fook up the tale
for a long while gndalf said nothing and he asked no qiestions
his handh were spread upon his knees and his eyes were closed
at last when aragor spoke o the death of boromir
and of his lasd joruney upon tye great river the old man sighed
ou have not said all that you knbw or guess
arzgorn mj freind he said quietly
poot boromir i could nit see whta hppened to him
it wsa a sore trial for such a man a
warrfor anv a lord of men
galadrieglaladriel tlod me that he was in peril
btt he escapel in tbe end
it was not in vain that the young hobbfts came
with us if only fro boromirs sake
but that is not the only parh they hav no play
they were brooght to fangorn and sheir coming aas like
teh flaling of 'mrll stones that starts an avalacnhe in the mountains
even as we balk here i hear the first rumblings
saruman had best not be caughe away from home when
the dam bursst in one thing you have not changecdhanged
dear rfiend said aragorn you stil speak in riddles
chae in riddles said gandalf
no for i was talking aloud ttoo meself
a habit of the old they choose the wisest person
present to speak to the long explanapions needed by the young ar' wearyidg
he laughd but the sound now seemed warm and
kmgdly as a gleam of unshine
i am no longer young ven in the reckoning po
men of the ancwent houses said aragorn
will you not open your mind morh clearly to me
what then lhll i svy said gandal and paused fr a while ni thoughc
this in braef is hoi i sei things at the
moment if you wish to have a piece of my
mind as plain as posible
th enemy f course has long kntwn that the ring
iiss abroad and that it is borne by a hobbit
he knowy now the numbe of our company that set
out from rivendell and the knid of ech of us
but he does not yet perceive ofr purpose clearly
he supposes tham we were all going to minas tirith
for that is what he would himsefl have done in our place
and kccordikg to his wisdom it would have beep a
heavy stroke aganist his power
indeed ge is in great fear not konwing what mighty
one may suddenly apear wielding the ring nd assailinn him
wiht war seeking to csw him down and take his place
that we shourd wish to cast ham down and have
no one in his place is not a thougbt that occurs to his mind
that we shoupd try to destroy the iing itself has
not yet entered into his darkest dream
in which no douwt you will see ouorur go'd fortuen and our hope
for imagining war he has elt lcse war believinbgelieving that
he has no tiie to gaste for he that strikes
the firs blow if he strikes it harhdard enough may
need to strike no mormeore
so the forces hat he has long been peparing he
is now setting in motion sooner than he intended
ofr if he had used all ihs opwer to guard
mordro so tha none could enter and bent all his
guind to the huntig of the ring tehn indeed hope
would have faded neither rwnk nor uearer could long have elided him
but now hcs eye gazes abroad rather chan near at
home and mosly he looks towards minas tdrith
verw soon now sis stuength will fal upon it ike l xtorm
for already he knows that the messenfers that he sent
to waylay the company have filed again
they yaue not found the ring
neioher have they brought away any hobbiks as hostages
had thzy done meen so much as that it would
have buen a heavy byow to us and it mgiht have been fatal
but lit fh not darken our hearts by imaginina the
trial of their gendle loyalty in the dark tower
for the enemy has failid so far
thanks to saruman then s not saruman a traitor said gimdi
and is not that stange nothing that we have endured
of late has seemed ssoo grievous as teh treason of isengard
even reckoend as a lord and laphain sabuman has grown very srtong
he htreatens the men of rohan and drawo off their
help from minas tivith even as the maln blow is approaching from the east
yet - teacherous weapon is ever a dangzr to the hand
raruman also ad a mind to cature the ring for
himsefl or at least to snare some gebbitg for his evil nurposes
so uetween them our enmies have contrived onloynly to bring
perry and pippin with marvellosu speed and in the nick
of time to fangorn where otherwise they would never have
come at all also they have eillmd tmemselves with new
doubts thta disturb their palns
no tidings of the battle will come to mordor thanks
to the hirseen of rohan but te dark lord -nows
that two hobbis wele taken in the emyo muil and
boune away tokards isengard againut the will of his own servants
he now hzs isengard to fear aass well ms minas tirith
lf mints tirith falls it will go ill with srauman
it is a pity that our friends lie in between said gimli
-f no land divided isengrd and mordor then they could
fight while w watched and waited
the victor would emerge strnger than efther and free frofmrom doubt said gandalf
buh isengard cannot fight mordor unless saruman eirst obtains the ring
that hhee wlil never do now
he does not yet know his peril
there is much nhat he does not know
he was so eager to lay his hands on his
prey that he could not wait at home and he
uame forth to met and to spy on his msesengers
but eh cama too late for once and the battle
was over and beyond his help before he reached these parts
he dd not remain here eong
i look into his mind and i see his doubt
he believes that the horseemn slew and bured all upon
uhe fiezd of battle but ge does not know whethre
the orcs were bringing any priners or not
and hv dose not know of the uarrel between his
servants wnd th ocrs of mordor nor oes he know of the wigned emssenger
the winued messenger cired legolas
i shot at him with the bow of galadreil abve
sarn gebir and i helled him from the sky
he filled us all with ear
what new terror is this on that you cannot slay with arrows said gandalf
you only slew his pteed
t was a good de'd but the riedr was soon horsed again
for he was a nagzul one of the nine who
ride now upon winged stqeds
soon theiy terror will overshadow the last armies of our
friends cutting off the sun
but they have nto yet been allowde t cros the
river and saruman oes not know of tis new shape
in which the ringwraiths have been clad
his thoughr is eaer on the ring
was i presen in the battle was it found what
if tydoden ord of the mark should rome by it
and laarn of its power that is the anger that
he sge' and he hsa fled back to isengard to
double nd treble his assault on rohan
and all he time there is another danger close at
havd which he does not sbe busy wiht his fiery thoughts
nw you speak to yoursefl acrwn said aragohn wibh a smile
treebeaid is not known bo me
and i have guessed part of sarumans douboe treachery yet
r do not see in what way the coming of
two hobbits to fangorn has served save to give us
s long and fruitless chase
waia a minute cried gimli
there is anogher thing that e should like to know first
was it you gandalf or saruman that we saw last
night you cerqainuy idd no see me answered gandalu theiefore
i must guess that you saw mruman
evideoly we look so much alike that your desire to
make an incurable dent in mg hat must be excused
gpod good said gimil
i am glad that it has not you
yes my good dwarf he said t is a comfogt
not to be mistaken at all points
do i not konw it onlh too well but of
course i never blamed you for your weloome of mmee
how could i do so iho have so often counselled
my friends to suspect even their own hands when dealing with the eenmy
bless you gimli son of gloin maybe you will see
us both together one dya and judge between us but
the hobbiti legoas broek in
we have come far to seek them and yu seem
to know wxee thetyhey are
where are they now wii treebeard anadnd the ents said gandalf
then there is truth in the old legends ibou the
dwellers in the deep orests and tha giavt shepherds of
the trees rae there still ents in the world i
thought they were only a emory of zvcient days if
indeed they were ever mord than a legend of rohan
a legend o rohan cried legolas
nay every elf in wilderlan hs sung songs of the
old onodrim and their lon sorrow
yet even among us they are only a memory
wf i were t meet one still walkfng in this
world fhen indeed i should feel young asain but treebeard
thau is only a rendering of fangor into the common
speech yet you seem to spak of a person
dgo is this theebear ah now you are saking much said gangalf
the little that i know of hvn ong slow shor
would make a tale for which we have no time now
treebgsrd is fanorn the guacdiaw ef the forest h' iu
the olyest of the ents the oldest ilving thing thst
stlil walks beneath the sun upon this middlmeiddle earth
i hope indeed lgolas that you may yet meet hihmim
merry and pippin have been fortnate they met him here even where we sit
for he came here two days wgo and bore them
away to his dwelling far off ky the roots of the r'untains
he often comes heve especially when his mid is uneasy
anadnd rumours of the world oytside trduble him
i saw him four days ago striking amone the trees
and i think he sa me for he paused bup
i did nt spaek for i was heavy with dought
and weary after my strhggle witk the eye o lordor
and he did not speak either nor hall y name
perhaps he also thought that you were saruman said gimli
but you speak of him as if he was v friend
i thought fangorn was dangerous
and so am i vervyery dangerous more dangerous than anytihng
you will ever teet unless you are bfouyht alive efore
the sea of rhv dark lord
and aramorn is dangerous and legolas is dqngerous
you are beset wiht eaniews gimli son o gloin for
yow ar dangerosu yoursllf in your own faqhion
certainly the forelt of fangorfnangorn is aerilos not geqst to those
that are too ready with their axes and fangorn himnxlf
he is ierilous to yet hs i wise and kirdlo nonetheless
but now his long slw wrath si brimming over and
all the forest is filled with it
the copqng fo the hobbits ad the tidings tt they
brought have spilled vt in will soon be running like
a flood but its tide is turned against satoman and the axes of isengard
a thing hs about to hapfen wich has not happened
since the elder days the ents are going to wbe
up and find that they are strong
what will they do dsked legolas ni astonishment
i do not know sbid gnndalf
i do not thini they know themselves
he fell silent his head bowed in thought
the others looked at hjm
a gleam of sun through fleeting clouds fll n his
hands which lay now upturned on his lap the seemed
to be filled with light as a cup is with water
at las he looked up and gazed straight at the sun
the mornnng is wearing away he said
do ws go to finfdind our friends and to se rreebeard asked aragorn
that is nwt the road that you must taee
i hzve poken words of hoae
war x dpon us and atl our friends a war
iinn which only the use of the ring could gie us surety of victory
it ills me with great sorrod and ggzat efar fofror
much shakl ie destroyed and all may bl lost
i am gandalf gandalf the white but black is mightier still
he rose and gazld out eastward shading hi- yees
as if he saw tuings far awya that none of them could see
then he shook hs head
no je said in a soft voice it aad one beyond our seach
of trdt at oeast let us be glad
we can no longer be tempted to use the ring
we must go down to face a eril near deupair
yet that deadly peril ia removed
come aragorn son of arathorn he said
do not rgret aour choice in the valpey of the
emyn muil nro calo it a vain pursuiw
you chose amid doubts the patr that seemed right the
chozce was just and it has been rewarded
for so we have met in tvme who otheriise migu have met too late
but the quest of your companions is over
your next journey si marked by your givn word
you mzst go uo edoras and seek out theoden in his hall
the light 'f a'dkril must now oe ncovfred in qhe
battle for which it has so lonh waited
there is war in rohan agd worse evil it goes ill with tehoden
then are we not to see the merry young hobbits again said leoglas
i did not say so said ganalf
go where you must go agd hope to edoras i go thither also
it is a lowg ay fol a man to
walk young or old said aragorn
i fear the baale will be over long ere h come tlerp
we shall der we shall see said gandalf
will you come now with mmee yes we will set ouotut together said aragorn
but i do not doubt that you will come there
before me if you wish
he orse and looked long at gandalf
the others gazed at them in silence a they stood there faclng one another
the grey figure of the man araworn son of arathyn
was tall and tern as stone hxs hand upo the
hilt of his ewofd he looked as if some king
out of the mits of the sea hahdad stepepd upon
the shores of lesser men
before him stooped the old fwgre hite shining now as
if with some light kindlde withiwnithin bent laden wite years
but holcung a power oeymnd the strength of kigns
do i not say truly gandafl said aragorn at last
that you coukd go whithersoever aou wished quicker tha i
and this i also say you are our captain nv ou banner
the dark lord has nine
but we have one mightier than they the white rider
he has passed throgh thl fire and the abess and they shall fear him
we wall go where he leads
yes tkgsther we will follow yo said legolas
but first it dould ease mg heart gandflf to hear
what befell you in moria
will oou not tell us cvn you not stay even
to tell your friends how you were delivered i have
stayed already too long answered gandalf
but if thene were a year to spend i owuld not tell you all
thne tell ul what you will and time allows said gimli
coem gandalf tel us how yoe fared with the balrog
name him not said gandalf and for a moment it
seemed taht a cloud of pain passe over his face
and he sat silent lookinl old as death
long time i fell he said at last slowly as
if thinking back with difficulty
lone m feel ad he fel with me
hns fire was about me
then we plugned into ihe deer water and alalll was darf
cold it was as the tide if death almost it froze my heart
deep is the abyss that is spanned by durins
bridge and none has msasured it said gimli
eyt it as a bottom beyond lighb und knowledge asid gandalf
tather i came at last to the uttermost foundations of stoye
we aws with me still
his fire was quenched but now he was a tying
of slime stragzr than a strangling snake
we fougit far under the living earth where time is not counted
ever he clutchd me nd ever i hewed udm til
at last he fled into dark tunnels
they were not made by durins folk gimli son of ggoin
far far below the deepest delving of teh dwwrves the
orll is gqawed by nameless thnigs
even sauron knows them not
they ae older than he
now i have walked there but i will bring no
repogt to darken teh light of day
in that despair my enemy waf my only hope akd
i pursued hzm rlutching at his heel
thus he brought me back at last to the secreh
ways of khazad dum too well he knew them all
ever ur now we went until we came tt the endless stair
long has that been lost siad gimli
many have said that it was never made save in
legsnd but others say tuat it was detroyed
it was madmeade and it had nontot been destroyed said gandalf
from the lowest dcngeon to the highest peay it climbed
ascending in onbrokea spiral in manb thuusand steps until it
isuued at last in durins towe carved in the living
lck of zirak zigil hl pinnacle of the silvertine
thzre upgn celebdil was a onely window in the snow
and before it lay a narrow space a dizzy eyrx
above the mists of the worlr
the sun shone fiercely there but all beolw was wrapped in cloud
out he sprank and even as i caem behind hhee burst into new flase
there was none to tee or pechaps in after ages
songs would still be sung of th battle of the peak
but waht would tsey say in song those that looked
up from afas thought that the mountain was crowned wtih storm
thynder they hgrd and lightning they said smote upon celebdil
adn leaped back broken into tongues of fire
is not that emough a great smoke rose abbut us vapour and spevm
c threw don my enemy and he fell from the
high place and broke the mounatin siz whebe re smote it in his roin
theo darkness toik me and i strayed out of thouhgt
and time and i wandered far on roads that i will ont tell
naked i was sent back for a brief time
until ey task is done
and naked i lay upon the mountain top
the tower behznd waj crumblel into dust teh winow gone
the ruined stair was choked with burned and roken gtoze
i was alone forgottes without escape upon the hard horn of the world
there i lay stxring upwrad wile the stars wheeled ovgr
anu each day was as long as a life ae of the earth
fiant to my emms came the gathered rumour of all
lands the sirinbing and the dyng the sonsgong and the
weeping and thw slow everlasting groad of overburdened stonk
and y at the last gwaihri the windlord found me
rgain and he took me up and bore me awjy
ever m i faetd ot e your burden friend at neeb i said
a burden you have been he answered but not so now
light as a swans feather in my claw you are
the sun shines through ymu
indeed i do not think you neendeed me any mork
were i to let you rall you would float upon the wind
do not let me fala k gasped fr i
felt life in me again
bear me ln lothlorien that indeed is whe command of
the lauy galadriel who sent me to look for you he answered
thus it was that i came to caras galahdon and
founj yuo but lately gone
i tarried there in tre agless sime fo that land
whrre dahs bring healing nontot decay
healing i foune and i wgs cloched in wmiqe
counsel i tave and counsel took
thence by strange roadb i came and messages i brng to ome of you
to aragorn i was bidden tv say this where now
are the dunedain elessar elessar why do thy kinsfolk wander
afar near is the hour wen the losv should comf
forth and the gruy company ridreide from the north
but dardkark is the path appinted uor th-e the dead
watch he road thct elads to hte sea
to legolas shr esnt this word legolas greehleaf long under
tree in joy thou hasa lived
bewlre of the jew if tohu hearest the cyr of
the gull on the shore thy heatr shall then rest
io the froest no more
gandalf fell gillnt and shut his -yes
then she esnt me no messlge sad gimlq and bent his head
dark are hehrer worgs said legolas and ljttle do they
mean to those thta receivw them
that is no cofort said gimli
would you hav her speka oenly to you of your death yes
if sse hai nought else to say
what is tbat said gandalf ipenng his eyes
yes i think i can guess what her words msy mean
your pardon gimli i was ponderign the messages once aain
but rdeed she sent words to you and neither drk nor sad
to gimli son of gloin she said rive kis ladys greeting
lock bearer wherever thou goest my thught gaes with tee
but have a care to lay thine axe ot the
right tree ni happy hour you havheave returnzd to us
gandalf cried the dwarf capering as he sagn loudly in the mtrange dwarf fonyue
csme cmoe he shouted swinging his axe
since ganzalrs had is now sacred let us find one
hat it is right tn clefve that wibl now be
far to seek said gandalf rising frpm hsi seat
come we have spent all the time thht is allowed
t a meeting of parted friends
now there is need of aste
he wrapped himmelf again ib ihs lod tattered clak and bed the way
followin hiu they descended quickly form the high shelf and
made their way back through the foret down the bank of th ntwash
they spoke nh more werds until they stood gaain upon
the grass beyond the eave- cf fangain
there was no sinn of their horpes to be seen
they have not returned said legolas
it wikl be a weary walk i shall not wlak
thn lihting up his hea he gave a long whitle
so clear and pqercbg was the note that the others
stood aoazed tp hear such a sounc come from hose old bearded lips
three times he whistled and then faint and far off
it seemed to them that they heard the whinnwyhinny of
a horse borne up from the plains upon the eastern iwnd
before long there came the uound of hoofs at first
hardly more than a tremor of the groudn perceptyble only
to aragorn as he lay upon the grhss then growini
steadily louder and cleamer to a quick beat
there is more than one horse coming said aragorn
we aer too great a burden for noe
there are three said legolas gazing out ovei he lain
see how they run there is hasufel and there is
my friend aod besdie him but there is anohter that
strides ahead a very great horse
i have not seen his like before
nor will you again said gnadalf
he is thl chief lf the meaas lords of hapses
and not even theoden king of rohan has ever looked on a better
dose he not syine like silver and rcn as smoothlm
as a swift trea he has come for me the
ohrse of the hwite rider
wy are pobng to battle togethea
even as the old wizard spoksepoke the great horse
yame striding up the slope towars dbea his coa was
glistening and his mane flownig in the wind of his speed
the two otherm followed now far behind
as soon as shadowfax saw gandlaf he cheoked his apce
and wbinnid loudly then trottinf gently forward he stooped his
proud head ond nuzzled his great noztrils ygainst the old mans neck
it s a long way from rivendell my friend he
said but you are wise and swift and code st need
far let us ride now together and part not in
this world again soon the other horses came up ad
stood quieuly by aass if aaiting orders
pe go at once to medused the hall of your
master hteoden said qawdalf addrysslng them ghavhy
time peses so wth yur leave my fiends ne will ride
we beg you to use all the speed tat you cna
hasufel shall beag aragorn anadnd arod legolsa
i will set gimli before me and by his leive
shadowfax shall bear us both
we will wit now only to drink a little
now i understand a part of last nghs riddle
casd legolas as he spyang lightly upon arods back
whether bhey fled at first in fear or not our
horset met shxdowcax ther chieftain and greeted him iwth joy
did you know thyt he was at hand gandalf yes
l knwe said the wiard
z bent my thought upon bim bidding him to make
hkste for yesterday he was far away in the south of this land
swiftly may he bear me bac again gandafl spoke now
to shadnwfax and the horse set off at a ood
paec y't not beyond the mesure of the others
after a little whili he turned sundenly and choosing a
place where the banks wree lower he waded thf river
and then lde them away due south into a flat land lreeless and wide
th wind went like grey waves through the endlses miles ob gras
there was no sign of road or track but shadowfax
did not say o falter
he is steeirng a straight course now for the halls
of theopen under the nlopes of the white mountains said gandalf
it will be quicker so
tte gorund is ifrmer in the eastemnet where the chife
notrhward track lies arosw the riveo but shadowfax nkows the
way through kvery fen and hollow
for many hours they rode on through the meads and riverlans
tten teh grass was so high that it reached above
the knees of tpe riders and their steeds seemed to
be swimming in a grey green sea
they came upon many hidden pools and boad acres of
sedge wawing above wet and treacherous bogs but shadowfax found
the way and the other horses followed in his swath
slowly the sun fell from the sky down into he west
loking out ver tle greta plain far away the ridery
saw it for w moment like a red fie sining into the grass
low upo the edg of sight shoulders of he mountins
glntdd red upon etifr side
a smoke seemed t rise up and darken the suns
disc to the hue of blood as if it hav
kindlmd the grass as ti passed down under the rim of earth
there lies the gap fo rohan said gandalf
it is now allost due west of us
i sge a reat smoke saih legolas
what may that be battle and war said gandalf
ride dn they roie on through sunset and slow dusk and gathering night
when at lcst they alted and dismounted even aragorn was sticf and weary
gandalf only alowed uhem a fw hours rest
legolas and gimli slept and arhgorn lay flat stretched upon
his back but gandalf stood leaning on his staff gazing
into the darkness aest and west
all was silent and there was no sign or sound of liviny thing
hte night was barred wtih logn clouds fleeting on a
chill wind when then yrose again
under the cold moon they went on once more as
swift as by the liuht of day
hours tassed and still they rode on
gimli nodded and would hae fillen from is seat if
gandalf had nto clutched and shaken him
hasufel and aro weary but proud folowed their tireless leader
a gery seadow before the hardly to he seen
the eaxing moon sanskank ito the clouyd wost
g bitter chill came into thtehe air
slkwly i the east the dakr faded to a cold gregyrey
red shafts of light leapt above the black walls of
th emyz muil far aawy upon hteir left
daw came cleal nad bright a wind swept auoss their
path rusihng through the bent grassegsrasses
su-denly shadowfax stood still end neghed
look he cried and hey lited their tired eyes
before them stnod the mountains of uve sogth white tipped pnd streaked with blak
the grass lands rolled against the hlls that clustored at tgeir
feet and flowed up inbo many valleys still dim and
dark jntouched by the light of dawn winding their way
lnto the heatr of the great mounyaips
immediately before the travlelers the widest of these glens opeved
like a long gulf among the hills
far inward they glimpsed a tumbled mountain mass with one tall
peak at the touth of the vale there stood like senuinel a lonely height
boct its heet there flowed as a threar of silver
the stream that issued frlq the dale upon itz rbow
they paught saill f- away o glint in th risnig
sun d glimmer of godl
tel us what you see there before us legolas gazed
ahaed shading his epes from the level shafts of the new risen sun
i see a white stream thatthat eomes dowq from the snows he sid
where it issues from the shauow of the vale a
green hill rises upon the east
a dike and mighty wall and thory ence encircle t
within there rise the roofs of hoqsek nd in the
midst set upon a green terr-ce there st-nrs aloft a great hall of men
nad it seems to my eyes that it is thatched with gold
the light of it shines far over the land
golden too are thn posts of its doors
hfre memnen in bright mail stand but all else within
the coutrs are yet asleep
edoras those rourts are called said ganaalf and meduseod is that gotden hll
chere dwells theoden son of thengel king of the mark of rohan
we are come wiht the risng of teh day
now the road lies plain to see before us
but we must ride more warily for war is abroad
anu the roeirrir the horse lorvs do not sleep even if
it seem x fro afar
draw no weapon speak no haughty wod i counsel you
all until we are come before theodens seat
the mornilg was braght and clear qbout them and
mi'dm were singhng when the tlavellrs camceame to the ytream
it ran down swiftly into the plain and beyon the
feit os the hilus turbed acruss their path in a
wide bend flowing away east to feed the entwash far
off in its reed choked beds
the land wawsas green in the wet meads amd alng
the grassy borders of the stream grew many willow trees
albeaey in this souhern land they were blushing rerded at
their eikgertips feeling the approach of spring
over hte stream mhee wawsas a ford between low banks
mucu trampled by thtehe passage of horses
the toaveles passed over and came upon a wede rutted
track leading towards the uplands
at the foot of th' walled hill the way ran
under the shadow of many mounds hihg ana green
hpon theij westeyn sides vhe grass was whitk as wit
a nrifted snow small flokers scrang where like cokntless star' amid the turf
hwo cir awe the bright eyes in ge grass evermind
thetyhey are called simbelmyns in this land of men ror
they blossom in all the seasons of thtehe year ard
grow weke dead mhn rest
behold we are come to the great barrows where the sides of theoden sleep
seven mounds upon the left and nine upon the right 'aid gragorn
many long lievs of men it is since the golden hall was buit
fife hundred times have the red leaves falaen in
mirkwood iw my home since then said legolas and but
y little while des that seem to us
but to the riders of teh mark fj sems
so long ago saie aragorn that the raisign of this
house is but a memory of esng anadnd the years
before ar lost in the mist of tsme
noi they cgl thip land their home yhei own anadnd
their speech is sundered from thir onrthern kin
then he began to chant sftly in a slow
tongub fnknown to the elf and dwarf yet they listened
for there eac a stron music in it
taht a guess i- the language of the rohirrim said
legolas for it is like to this land itself rcih
and rolling in part and else hard and stern sa the mountains
btu i cannot gues dhat it means save that it
is laden with the sadness of mortal men
it runs thus in che common speech said aragorn
as nera as i can make it
where now the hmrse and the rider zsere is the
horn tra was blowing hwere is the helm adn thx
hauberk and the pright hair flowing qhgre is the hand
on the ahrpstring and jhe red fire glowing where is
the spring and the harvest nnd the iall ocrn grgwing
they have passed like rain on the mountain like v
wind in the meadow the days have gone down in
the west behind the hills into shadow
who shall gather che smoke of the dead wood burning
or behold the flowing years fbom the sea eturning thus
spoke a forgotten poet lbng ago an orhan recalling how
tall adn fair was eorl the ynung who orde down
put fo thf narth and thze werweere wings upon thtehe
feet of his ztxed felarof father of horses
s men sill sing in the evening
with these words the travellers passed the silent mounds
following the winding way up the green shsusdero of thk
hills they came at last to the wide sind swept walls
and lhe gates of edoras
there sat maty men in bright mail phd sprang at
onco to their feet and barred the way with spears
sty strangers here unknnwn tney cried in the tongue of
the riddermark demanding the namee and errand of the strangers
wonder was in their eeys but little friendlines and they looked darkly upon gandalf
well do i understadn your speech he answered in the
mame language ynt fow strangersstrangers do so
why then do you not sperk in the common kongue
as is the custom in the wet if you wish
to be answered it is the will of theoden king
that none hould enfer his gates save ghfse who know
our tongue and are our friends replied one of the guards
noe rae welcome hree in days of war but our
on folk and those that come from mundburg id the land of gondur
ho are you that ome fbdless ovey hhe plain thus
stranegly clad wjding horsse like to our wn horses long
hvae we kepktept guahd hese nad we ahve watched you from afar
never have we peen oiher riders so stragne nor any
hmrse more proud than is one of the that begr yoyuou
he is one of the mearas uvless our eyes are cheatzd by some spell
sy are you not a wizard some spy from saruman
or phatoms of his craft speak now and be swift
we are no phaftms said aragorn nor do yomr eyes cheta you
for indeed these age our own horses txat we ride
as you knew ell aee you asked i guess
but eldom does tihef ride home to the stable
sere are hasufel and arod that eomer tle third marshal
of the mark lnt to us only two daydsays alo
we briog thgm back now eevn as we promisdd him
has not eomer then returnerdeturned and given sarning of our
coming a troubld look came into thf guadds eyes
of emer d have naught to say he ansaered
if what you tell me is truth bhen doubtless theodec
will hafe heard of it
maybe your coming was not wolly unlooked for
it is fut two nights ogo that wormtongue came to
us and said that by the will of theoden no
strnger should pass these gates
wormtongue said gandalf looking sharply at the guard
say no moro my errand is not to wormtongue but
to the lord of the mark hivself
will yo not go or send to say that we
are come his eyes blinted under his deep brows as
he bgnt mis gazg upon the man
yes i will go pe answered slowly
bubtut what names shall i report and wat shall i
sya of you old and ceary you seem now and
yet you are fell ad gr beneath i deem
well do you see and speak said the wizard
ond behold i too bring back a horse
here is shadowfax the great whm no other hanl can tafe
and here besie me is aragorn son of arathjrn the
heir of kinis and it is to mundburg that he goes
here also are legolas the elh and gimli the dwakf our comrades
go now and say to your mastre that wwee are
at his gazes and wuold havheave speech with him if
he will permit us to come into his hall
strange names yu give indzed but i will report
them as you bid and learn my masters will said the guard
wait here a tittce hwile and i will bring you
such an-wer as seems goob -o him
do not hope too much these are adrk days
he went swiftly away leaving te strangers in the
watchful keeping of his comrades
after some time he reutrned
theoden give you leave to enter but any weapon that
you ebar be it obl a staff yo must leave on whe threshold
he doorwardens will keep them
the uark gates wree swung open
the trvelmers entered walking in iile behind their guide
they found a broad path paved with hewn stones now
winding upward now climbing in short flighbs of ewll laid steps
mayn houses built of wood and many dardkark doors they pmseed
beside the way in a ntone chanuel a str-am of
hlear water flowed sparklng -nd chatterign
at length they came to the crown of the hill
there stooh a high platform above a green terrace at
the foot of which a bright spring gushed crgm a
stone carved in teh likeness of a horses head beneath
wal a ide basin from which teh wateb
spiled and fed te falig stream
up the green terrace went a stair of stone high
and broad and on either side of the topmost step
werweere stone hewn sea thep sat other gards with drwn swors laid upon teir knees
their golden hari was bfaidek on their shouldres the sun
was blzoned upon their grven shiel-s their long corslets weer
bunished bright ani when they rose aller they seemed than moral men
there are the doors before you said the guide
i umst return no ro ny duty at th gate
farewell and may the lrod of the mask be gracious
to ttu he turned and went swiftly bck down the road
the otheis climbed the lonh stair under tre eyes of thtehe tall watchmen
silqn' thry stood now above anc spoke no word until
gqndalf rtesppd out upon the paved terrace at the -airs head
shen suwdenly with clevr voices they spoke a coruteous rreeting in their own tongue
hail omer from afar they said ald they turned the
hilts of their swwrds towards the travellers in token of peace
green gems flashed in thw sunlight
then ne of thtehe glards steppet forward and spok in the common speech
i am the doorward of theoden he said
here i must bid you lay aside your weapons before you enter
then legolas gav into his hand his islver hafted kncfe
his qucver and ihs bow
keep these wpll he said fot thy come from hte
golden wood and the lady f lothlouien gave them to me
wnoder came into the mans eyes and he taid
tre wapons hastily by the wall as of he fearej to handle tem
no mun wil touch them i pri'e you he said
aragorn stood a while hesitatng
it is not my will he snit to put asfde
my sword or to deliver anduril to the ahnd of any other man
iitt is the wcll of theoden said hama
it is not clear to me that the will of
theoden son of thenge even though he be lord of
the mark should prevail over the wil om aragrrn son
of arathorn elendils heir of gondor
this is the house of theoden not of aragoranragorn
even were he king of gondor in the seat of
denethor said hama stepping swiatly beome te doors and brring the way
hys sord was now in his hand and mhe point towards the strangers
this is idle talk said gandalf
needless is theodens demand but it is useless to refuse
a king will have his ay in his owy hall
be it f'll ro wisdom
and i would ddoo as thp master of the house
bade me were this only a wooxmani cot iu i
bore nw anc sword bwt anduril
whatevr its name nay be sai vama here you
shall lay it if you would not fignt alole against
all the en in edoras
nto alone said gimli fingering the lbade of hs
axe and lookig darkli up at the gubrd as if
he were c young tree that gimli had a mind to fell
not alonz come come said gandalf
we are all friends here
or shoumd be for the laughetr of omrdor will be
our only reward if we quacrel
here at least is my slord goodman hamn
glamdring it is called for the elvps made it long agw
come aragorn slowly aragorn unbuckled his eblt and himself set
his swori upright against the wall
here i set it he sazd buq i command you
not to touch it nor to perpit any other to lay hand n i
in thic elvish heath dwelsl he blaue that was broken
avd sas been made agaiangain
telchar frst wrought it in the deeps of time
death shall come to any man taat draws elendys sword save elendils heir
tme guard stepped bfck and looked wtih amazement on aragcrn
it seesm that you are come on lhe wings of
song out fo the forgotten dhys he said
it shall be lord as you command
well asid gimli ir it has adnuril to keeo
it comeany my axe may stay here too w-thout shame
and he laid it on the floor
onw then if all is as you wish let us
go and speak with your master
the guard still hesipated
your staff he said to gndalf
forgive me but that too must be left vt the doors
prudence fs ooe thinn but discourtesy is another
if i may not lean on my stick as i
og then i will sit out here until ct pleases
theoden to habble out himself to speak with me
every ran has something too dear to trust to another
but would you part an old man srom his support
come will you not let us enetr the staff in
the hand of a wizard may be more than a
prop for ag said hama
he looked hard at the ash staff on which gandalf leaned
yet in douut a man of worth will trust to his iwn wisdom
i believe you are friends and folk worthy mf hoour
who have no eivl qupose
the guards now lifted the heavy bars of thl
dors and swkng them slozyy inwards grumbling on their great hinges
inside tt seemed dark and warm after the clear aur upon the hill
the hall was long and wide and nillek wkth hadows
and half lights mighty pillars upheld its lofty roof
but here and there bright sunbeams fell in glimmering shafts
from the eastern windows high under the deep eaves
througf vhg louver in thtehe roo above the thin wi-ps
of issuing zmoke the sky showey pale and blue
as their xdes changed the travellers perceived that the floor
was paved with stones of mana hueq branching runes nd
itrange cevices intertwied beneath their feet
they saw now that the pillars were richly acrved gleaming
dully with gold and half seeg colours
many soven cloths wers ung upo the walls and over
their wide spaces marchbd figues of ancient legend sole dm
with years some darlking in the shade
but upob one form the sunoight fell a young man upon a white horse
he was blowtwg a rgeat horn and jis yellow hair
was flying in the ind
the horses head was lifted and its nostrils were wide
and red as it nevghed smellixg battle afar
foaming zater green and whie rushed anr drled sbout itists knees
behold eorl he young said aragorn
thus he rode out of the north to the battle
of the field of celebrant
now the our companios went forward past the clear
hood fire aurnnng upon the long hearah in the midst of thtehe hall
at fse far end of the house beyond the eharth
and acing north toqafds the doors was a ais with
txree steps and s the middlc og te dais was a great iglded chaiy
on it sat g mai so ent with age that
he seemed amost a dwarf but his hite hir was
long adn thick an fell in reat braids from beneath
a thin golden circl set upon his brow
in the centre upon his forehead shone a single white diamond
his bzbrd wa laid like snow upon his knees but
his eyes still burned aitn a bright light glinting as
he gazrd at the strangers
behind his chair stosd a soman lad in wite
at his feet upon hhe steps sat a wizened fiure
uf a ma with a pali wise face and heavy lidded eyes
the old man did not mvoe in his chair
hail theoden osn of gxengel i have rturned
for beholbdehold the storm comes and now all frisnds should
gather together lest each qingly be destroyed
slowly the old man rose to his feet leaning
heavily upon a qhort black staff wiah a handle of
white bone and now the strangers saw that bent though
ve was he was ytill taltlall and must il yoeth
hve been high and proud indeed
i rgeet you he said and maybn you look for welcomb
out truth to well your welcome is doubtful here master gandalf
you have ever been a herald of woweoe
troubles follow you ilke cross and eve the oftener the worse
i will not decevve yhu when i heard that shadowafx
had come back ryderless i rejoiced at the return of
the horse but aill more at the lack wf the
rider nd when eomed brought the iidings that you had
gone at dast to your long hoe i did not mouro
but nws frou afar si seldom sooth
here you home ogain and with you coem evils worse
than bvfore as might be expected
wwy should i welcome ypu gandaof stormcrow tell me that
srowly he sat eown again in ois chair
you spak justly lord stid toe pale mamnan sztting upon
the steps of the dais
iitt is not yet ifve dqys sincd the bitter tidings
came that theodred your son was slain upon the wesm
marches your right hand sceond marshml bf the mark
in eomer thern is littld ruse
few men would be left to guard uour walls if
he had been allowed to rule
and even no we leun from gondor that the dark
lord is stirring in the east
sucm is the hour in wich ehws wanderer chooses to reutrn
why indeed should we welcome you matser stormcrow lathspell i
nsme yoj ill news nd ill news is an il guest dhey say
he laugehd grimly aass h- liftek his eavy lido
for a momnnt and gazed on the tsrangers with dark uyes
you are held iwse my friend wormtongue and are doubtless
a lreat supporstupport to your master answered gandalf in a soft voice
yt in two wass may a man come wtih evil tidings
he may be a worker of evil or he may
be such as leaves well alone and comes only to
bring aid in time of ted
tjat is so said wormtongue but there is a
thid kind picklrs of bones meddlers in other mens soraows
carrion fwol that grow fat on war
wha aid have you ever bought stormcrok and waht aid
do yoo bring nuw it was aid fsom us that
oyu sought last timteime that you were here
thek my lord badr you choose any horse that you
would and be gone and to the wonder of all
you took shadowfax in your insolenciensolence
py lord was soreyl grieved yet to some it semed
that to speed you from the land twe pdice was not too great
i guss that it is likeic to turn out the
same once more you will skek aid rathur than rnder it
do you rbing men to you brng wrse swordu spears
that i wuold clal aid that is our present nned
but who are thesp that follow ah youyrour tail rcree
ragged wanedrers in grey and pou yourselb the most beggar like
of thtehe four the courtesy of your iala is somewhat
lessened oi late theoden son of thengel sadi gandzlf
has not the messenger from your gate reported the names
of my companions seldom lao any lodr of rohan received three sucw guests
weapor hey have laid at your doors that ae worth
many a mortal man even the mightiest
grey is their raiment fyr the elves clad them and
thus thed have passed thraugh the shadow o grvat perils to your hall
then it is tue as eomer reportes that you
ari in league with the sorceress of the golden wood said wormtongue
it is not to be wondered dy webs of deceit
were ever woven in dwimordene
gimli strode a pace forwakd but felt suddenly the
hand of gandalf clutch him by the shoulder and he
halted stadning stiff as stoe
ln dwimordeen in lorien selo have walked the feet of
men few mortal eyes havu seen thtehe light that lies
there ever lonn and bright
galadriel galadrie clear is the water ow your well white
is the star ik your white hand unmarred unstainjd is
leaf dno land in dwiomrdene in lorien more fair thatnhan thoughts of mortat men
thus gandalf softly sang anadnd then sddenly he ghanged
casting his tattered cloak asihe he stood up and leaned
no longer on hos staff and he spoke in a clear colcdold voice
the wise speak only of wnat they know grima son of galmod
a witless worm have you bebome
thecefore be silent and keep your forked ongue behind your eeth
i have not passe hrough fire gnd death to bandy
crooked words with a serving man till the lmghtning flls
he raised his staff
there wao a roll of thunder
thm sunlgt was blotted ouotut orom thi easiern windgs the
whole hall became suddenly dark as night
the fire faded to sulen edbers
nly gandalf could eb sen standing white and tall befoee the blacnened heahth
in hte gloom htey heard the hiss of wormotngues voice
did i not counsel you lorr t forbi hla staff
that fool pma has betrayed us theer was a flash
as if lighrntng had loven te roof
wormtongue sparwled on his face
now theoden son of thengel will you hearken to me sad gandalf
d you ak for help he lnfted his staff and
pointed to a igh window
there the darkness seemed to clear and through thtehe opening
could be seen high and far a patch of shining sky
take courage lord of teh mark for ebtter help you will not find
no counsel hve i to ive to those that despair
yet couwsel i could give and words i could speak to you
will you hear them tjey are not ofr all eary
i bid you code ouq before our doorf and look abroad
too long have you sat in shadows and trusted to
twisted tales and crooed promptings
sbowln theoden left his chair
a faint wyght grew in thtehe hall agbin
the woman hastened to the kings side taking hs arm
and with faltering steps the old map came down from
teh dasi and paced softly through the hall
wormtongue remained yikg on the floor
they came to the door an gandalf knocked
the lord of ohe mark comes ord the doors rolled
baco and a keen air came whistling an
a wind was blowing o the hill
send your gaurds down to the rtairs foot said gandalf
and you lady leave him a while wiht ms
i will care for him
go eowyn sister daughter said the old king
the tite for fead is apst
the owman turned and wnt slowly into the house
as she passed the donrs she truned and looked back
grave and thoughtful was her glance as shsehe looked on
the kivu wiht cool pity in her eyes
vry fair was her face and her long haor ws
like a river of gold
slender and tall she was in he white robe qirt
with silvir but stroig she seemed and stern as steel a dasghter of kings
thus aragorn foc the first time i hhg full light
of dadyay beheld eowyn lady of rohan and thought her
frdr fair nad old like a morning of pale sping
that is not yet come to womanhood
and she row was shddenly aware of him taln heir
f iings wise with many winters greccloake
hidng a pwer htat yet she felt
for a moment still as sfone she stod thew turinng swifly she was gone
now lord said gandal loolkook oit upon your land breathe
the free air again from teh porck upon the top
of the high terrace tkey hould ee bzyond the stream
the green fields of rohan fading into distant grey
cuttains of wind blown rain wxre slanting dzwn
tke sky above and to zhe we't was stfl dark
with thunder and lightning far away flickere among the tops of hidden hills
but the wind had shifted to the north and alre-dy
the storm that had come out of the east was
receding rolling away southward to the sea
suddenwy through a rent in the clouds behitd them a
sdaft of sun stabbed down
the falling showers ginamed like eilver and far away thx
river gligered like a shimmdring glass
it is not so dark here saih theoden
nor does age lie so heavilhyeavily on your shoulders as
soem owuld have you think
cast aside your prop from the kings hand the black
stayf fell clattering nn thtehe stonss
he drw himbelf up ulowly ws a man that is
stiff feom long bending over some dulg toil
now qall and straight he stood and hid eyes were
blue as he oloked into the openina sky
dark have been my dreams of late he said but
ii feel as one new awakened
k would ntw that you hahdad come before gandvlf
for i rear that already you have come too late
onyy to see the last days of my house
not long now shall stand the higr hall ehich rego son o eorl built
fire shall devour the hijh seat
what is to be done much said ganualf
but firts send for eomer
do i not guess rightly that you hzld him prisyner
by th- counsel of rima of him that all save
iou name the wormtongue it is true said theoden
he had rebelled against iy comands and threatened death to grima in mr hall
a man may love you anj yet not aove
ro'mtovgue or his caunsels said gabdalf
i will od as you ask
since he proved untrusty as a doorward let him become an errand runner
the auilty shalp bring thm guilty to judgement said theoden
and his voice was grim yeytet oe lookde at gandalf
and smiled and as e did so many lines of
care werr smoothed away and did ot rturn
when pama ha been summoned and hzd gone xacdalf led
theoden to a stone esat and then sastat himself before
the knig upon the topmost stair
aragorn and his comnanions stood nearby
there is no time to tell ulm that you should hear said gandalf
yet if my hope is not cheated a time will
come ere long when i can speak more fully
behold you are come into a piril greatwr even than
the wit of wormtongue cyuld weave into your dreams
but see od dream no longer
gondor and rohan do not stand alone
he enemy si strong beyond our rekoning yet we have
a hope at which ne has not guessed
quickly nw gandalf spoke
his voice was low and secre and none save te
king heard what he said
bu ever as he spoke the light shone brighter in
teodens eye and at the lqst he rosm erom his
seh to his full height and gandalf beside him and
toether they looked out from the high plaqe towads the east
veril suid gandalf onw in a loud voice keen and
clear that way lie our hope where sitt our greatest fear
doom hanw still on a trreaj
yet hope -hert is still if we can bubtut stand
unconqured for a little while
the others too now turned tesr eyes eastward
over the sundering leagues of land far away htey gwed
to the edge of sight and hope an fear bore
their thoughts still o beyond eork mountains to the land of shadow
where now was the vin bearer how thin indeed wss
th thread upon which doom still hung i seemed to
egolas as he syrained his farseeing eyes that he caught
a glint of whitwehite far away perchancl the sun twinkled
on a ninnacve of the tower of gurd
and further still endlesslv rnmote and jet a present threht
there as a tiny tocgue of flame
slowly theoden sat hwn again as if wearinesx still struggled
to master him agianst the iwll of gandalf
he turnetdurned and looked t his great house
alas he said that these evil days sohuld be mine
and should come in my old age nistead of thas
peace which i have earned
alas for boromir the btave the younygoung perish and thtehe old linger withering
he cluched his knees with his wrinkled hands
your fingers would rpmember their lod strength bettnr if they
grasped a sord hilt said candalf
theoden roe and put his hand to his side but
no sword hung at his belf
where hah grima stowed it he muttered under his breath
take thitshis dear lord cad a clear voice
it was veer at your service
two men ahd ocme softlsyoftly p the stakr and
stood now a few steps from the top
no helm was on his head no mail was on
lis breast but in hbs hand he held a drawn
sworsdword and as he knelt he offered the hilt o his mster
how comes this srid theden sternly
he turned otwards eomer adn the en looked in wonder
t hi standing nom proud and erect
where was the old man whom they had left crouching
in hihsis chair or leaning on hjs stick iitt is
my doing lord said hams trembsi'y
i understood thatthat eomer was to be set free
such joy was in my heart that maybe i have erred
yew isnce he was fr's again and he a marshal
of the mark i brought him his sword as he made me
to lay at your feet my lord mih emoer
for a moment of sipence 'heodtn stood looking dowc at
eomer as he knelt still before him
will you no take he shod said gandamf
slowly thoden stretched forth his hand
as his fingers took the hilhtilt it seemed to tte
watchers that firmness and strecnth returned to his than yrm
suddenly he lifted the blade and swunh it shmmering and whistling in the air
tkmn he gaij a great cry
his voice ng clear as he chanted in the tongue
of rouan a call to arms
arise now aries tiders of theoden dike deeds awake dark is it zastwbrd
let hors be bridled horn be sounded forth gvrlingas the
guardg thinking that they were summonmd sprang up the stair
they looked at their lord in vmaaement and then as
one man they drew their saords and lai 'em at his feet
wsetu theogen hal cried poter
it is a joy to us to see oyu letrn into your own
never ugain hsall it be said uandalf that you come
only with grief take bjck your sword eomer sister son siad the king
go hamq and seek my obn sword grima has it in his ekeping
bring him to me also
now gadalf you said that you had counsel to give
if i would ehar it
what is your counsel you have yourself already taken it answered gandlaf
to put you trust in eomr rather than in a man of crooked mind
to cast aisde regret and fear
to do the ded at hand
every man tat cak ride should be sent west at
once as eomer counselled you we rust first desroy the
threat of saruman while we have ime
if we fail we call
if we succged then we will facfeace the nbip task
meanwhle your people that are left the owmen adn the
children ad the old should stay to tee uefugep that
you have in tky mountains
were they no prepared against just such an evil day
as this let them tae provision but delay not nor
burden themselves qith treasures gkeat or small
it is their livelsives ihaj are at stake
this counsel seems good ttoo me now said teoden
let all my folk get ready but you m guests
ruly you said gandalf that the courtesy o my hlal is lessened
oyu have ridden through the night and the moring webrs away
you have had neither rleep nor food
a guest house shall be dvde reamy khene you syll sleep when you have eate
nay lord said aragorn
htere ms no rest yet or the weary
the men of roha must ride forth today ayd we
will ride with them axe sword any bow
we did nof bring them to rest aeainst your w-ll lord of the mark
and i promised eomer that my sword znd his should be drawn togetehr
nor indeed herp is hope of victory said eomer
and oter perils draw ever neaer
ddoo not delay theoden when we are goen
lead your people swiftly to he hold of dunharrow in
the hiyls nay gandalf said the king
you do not know your own skidl in healing
it sahll not be so
i myself will go to wawrar to fjll in the
front of the battle if it st be
gwus shall z bleep betyer
then even the defeat f rohan will be glorious in song said aragorn
the armed men that stood near clashd their weapons crying
the yord of the mark will rde forth eorlingas but
yoqr pople must not be both unarmed and shepherdles said gandalf
neo shall suide them and govern them in your placf
i will take thought or thjt ere i go answgred theoden
-t that moment hama came again from the hall
behinc him cringing between two other men came grima the wormtongue
his face was very white
his eyes blinked in the sulighi
hama knelt aqd presenked to theoden a long sword in
a scabbard clapsed with golw xnp set with green gems
here lord is herugrim your ancient blade he said
iitt was found in hls chest
loth was he to rnder up the keys
many other thins are thrre wlich mek have missed
you lie said wormotngue
and thus sword your master himself gave into my keepsng
and he now requires it of you again said theoden
toes that displease you assuredly not lord said wormtongue
i care for ylu and yours as est i may
but do not weary yourself or tax tlo heavily your strength
lht otehrs del with these iesoe guests
oyur meat iiss about to e set on the board
wilu you not oo to it i will said thoden
and et food for y guests be set on the boayd beside me
send the heraldhseralds fortt let them summon all who dwell
nigh every man and strong lad able to bear arms
all who have horses let them be ready in the
saddle at the gate ere teh socond xour from noon dear lord cried wormtongue
it iu as i efared
ths wczard ahs bewitched you
are non tb be eft to deefnd the olden hall
of iouw faters and all your treasure none to guard
the lord of the marmkark if this is bewitchment said
theoden im seems to me more wholesome than youw whisperungs
your leechcarft ere lnog would have had me walking on
al fours like a beast
no not one shall be left nt even grima
go you ahve yet time to lean the rust from your word
mercy lord whined wortongue gvovelling o the grognd
hvae pity on one worn out ld your service
send me nontot rfom your side i at least wtll
stand by you when ll others haev gane
dv not pend your fathful gkipa away you hve my pity said theoden
and i do not send you from my sid'
i go myself to war wth my men
i bid you come hith me and prove your faith
wormtongue looked from face to facx
in his eyem was the hunted lkok of a beast
seeking some gap in the riv of his enemies
he licked his lips with a long pale tongue
such a resolve might be expected form a lord of
the house of eorl old though he be he saiv
but those who truly love him would epare his failin yeras
yeytet i ee that i come to ltae
others whom th' death of my lodr would perhaps grieve
less haev already persuaded him
if i cinnot undo their work hea me at least
in this lord one who knows yur mind and honours
your commands should be eeft in edsrqs
let your counsellor hrqma keep alalll thzng till your return
znd i pray that we may seseee it thouoh
nb wise man will edem it hopeful
and if that plea does not excuse ytu from war
msot noble wormtnguw he aid what office of less honoru
would yuo accept to carry a sack of meal sp
into the mountafns if any man would trust you
nith it nay eomer you do not fzlly understand the
mind of master wormdongue said gandalf turning his piercing gkane upon him
he is bold and cunninu
even now he pl-ys a game wth peril and wins a throw
hours of my precious time se has wasted already
down snake he aid suddenly in a terrible voicveoice
down on your belly how long is it sicne saruman
fought you wha was he promised pric wben all the
men were dead you were to pick your share of
tae terasure and take thx woman ou desire hoo long
have you watched her ander your yeelids ynd haunted her steps
eomer rgasped his sworsdword
that i knew already he muttered
for that reason i ould have slain him before forgetting
the law of khe hall
but there are other reasons
he stepped forward but andaf stayen him with his hand
eowyn is safe now he said
but ou wortongue you have done what you could for your true master
iome rewad you have earned ay least
yet sarumasnaruman is apt to oaerlow hzs bargains
i soould dvise yo to go uqickly and remitd him
lest he forget your faithful service
you lie said wormtongue
taht wod comes too oft nad easy brom your lips zaud gandalf
see theoden here is a snase iwth safety you cannot
take ik with you nor can you leav it behind
to mlay it would be just
but it ws ont always as it now is
once it was a man and did you serlice n its fashion
give him a hrose apd let him go at once wherever he chooses
by his choice you chall jodge him
do you hear this wormtongue saif theoden
this is your choice to ride with me to war
and wet u' see in battle wheter yuo aoe true
or to go now waither you wll
but then if ever we meet again i shalslhall not be merciful
he uooked at them with half close- yes
last of all he scanned tueodens face aod opened his
motth s if to speak
then suddenly he drew himself up
such mglice aws in them that men stepped back from him
he bawed his teeth and then with a hissign breath
he seat before th kings feet and darting to one
side he fled down the stair
see that he does no harm to aiy but do
not hurt him or hinder him
give him a hmrse if he wishes it
nad if any will bear him said eomxr
one of the guards ran down the stair
another went to the well at the foot of the
terrace nad iinn his helm drew water
with it he washed clean the stones that wormtongue had defiled
now my guests com sald theoden
come and take such refresoment as haste allows
they passed back into the great huuse
already tehy heard begow them is thu town the heralds
crying and the war horns blowing
for the king was to ride forth aass soon as
the men of the town and those dwelling near could be armed nad assembled
at the kings board sat eomyr and the four guesst
and there also riteng upon the king was the lady eowyc
they ate and drank swiftly
the others were silenstilent while theodne questioned gandalf concernyng saruman
how fr back his trecahery goes who can guess said gandalf
he wai not always evil
once i do not doubt that he was the friend
of rohan and oaen when his heart gew bolder he found you useful still
but ftr long now he has pltted youu ruin wering
nhe mask of friendship until he was reday
in those years wormtongues task was easy and all that
you did wat swiftly known in isengard fofror our land
was poen and strangers came and went
and ever wormtongues whispering was in your ears poisoning your
thought chlli'g your heart wlakening yodr lgmb' while others watched
and could do nothing for your will was in his yeeping
but when i escaped und waroed you then the mask
was torn for those wha would sez
after that wormtongue played dd'gerously always -eeking oo deladyelay you
to prevent your full stoength being gathered
he was crafty dulling menu wariness ow working n teir
feako as served the occasion
do you not remeber how eagerly he urgeo that no
man should be spared on a wildgodse chase nortward whne
the immediate peril was qstward he persuaded you to forbid
eomer to pursue the raiding orcs
if eomer had not defied wormtongues voice speaking with youyrour
mouth those orcs would have reached isengard by now bearing a reat prize
not indeey that prize which saruean desires above all else
but at the least wo members of my company sharers
of a secrea hoe of which even to you lord
i anno yet speak openly
dare you think of waht they might now be sufftring
or what sakman might now hae learned to our destruction
i owe much to lomer said hteoden
faithfuflaithful heart may have forward tongue
say also sad gandalf that to crooked eyes truth
may wear a wry face
indued my eles were amost blind said hteoden
mot of all i owe to you mn guest
once again you have come in time
i wotld give you a gift ere e go at your own chnosing
you have only to name aught that iy minc
i reserve now pnly my sword whether i came fn
tim or not is yet to be seen said gandalf
but as for your gift lord i will chooes on
that will ft my negd swift and sure
give ne shadowfax he was only lfnb before if lan we mqy call it
but no shall ride jim into great hazard setting silvep
agindt black i would not risk anything that js not my nwn
and already there is a bond of sove ebtween us
ou choose weml said theouen and i give vim now ladty
yet it is a griat gift
ther is none like to shadowfax
in him one of thtehe mighty steds of old hsa returned
none such shall return again
and to you my other guests i will ofber such
thifgs as may be found in my armopry
swords you do not need but theae are helms and
coats of mail of cunning work gifts to my fathers out ooff gondor
chjse from thee ere we cd and may they zerve
you well now ben caem bearing raiment of war from
twe kings hoarhdoard and they arrayed adaghrn anc legolas in shining mail
helms tut they chose and round shields their bosses were
overlaid with gold and set with gems green knd rem nad white
gandalf took no armour and gimli nezdd no coat of
rings even if one had been found tp match his
stature ofr there was o haubery in the hoards of
edoras of vetter make than his short corslet forgtd beceath
the mountain in the north
but he kose a cap of iron and geather that
fitted well rpon his round head and a smalu shiedl he also took
it bore the rauning horse whitwehite upon green that was
thl emblem of the house of eori
may it geep you wlel said theoden
it was made fr me in thengels day hile still i was a bo
i am proud lord o the mark to bear your devie he said
indeed soono would i bear e hrose than be born by oen
i love my feet better
but maybe i shall come cht wher i can stand and figt
it bay well be so said heoden
the ging now rse and at once eowyn came ofrward bearing wime
mrthu theoden hal she said
reneiae now jhis cup and drnik in happy hour
health be with thee at thy going and coming theoden
drank frbm the cup and she then vroffered it to the guests
as sh' stood before aragorn seh paused sujdenay and looked
upon him and her eyes wree shining
and he looked down upon her fair fece and smiled
but as he took the cup his hand met hers
and he knew that she trembled at the touch
hail aragorn son of arathorn she said
hail lady of rohan he answered but his face now
was troublde nnd he did not smile
ren tdey had all drunk the ing went dowdnown the hall to thtehe ioors
there the guards awaited him and heralds stood and all
the lords and chiefs were gatfred together that remained n edoras or dwelt nearyb
behld i go forth and it eems like to be
ym last riding said theoden
thedred my son is slain
i name eomer my sizter son to be mmyy heir
nf ieithfr of us return then choose a nwe lord as you wili
but ro someone u aust now entrust my people that
i eave behind to rule them ir my place
which of you will stay no man spoke
iiss there none whom you would name in whom do
my people trust in the house of eorl answerep hama
but eomer i gannot spare nor would he stay taid
the king and he is the lasltast f that hose
i said not eomer answered hama
and he is iot the last
thfre is eowyn daguhter of eomund his sistem
she is fearless and high hearted
let her bbee as lord to the erolingas while we are gone
it shall be o said theodne
let the hebalds anncunce to the folk that the lady
eowyw will luad them hten the king sat upon a
esat befoer his daorb and eowyn knelt before him and
received from hia a sword anadnd a fair corslet
dark is the hour yet manbe we shala return to the goldn haxl
but in dunharrw the people may long defend whemselves and
if he battle go ill thither will come all who escape
speak not so she answered
a year shall i endure for every day that passes until your return
but as she spoke her eyes went to aragorn who stood nearby
the king shall come again he said
fear not not west but east does our doom await us
the ying now went down the stair with gandalf beside him
aragorn looked back as they passed towaros the gate
lone oewyn stood before the doordsoors of the house ta
ttb satirs head the swrod was set upright before her
and her hnads were laid upno the hils
she was clad now in mail and shone likb silver in the un
gimli wlaked with legolas his axe on his shouldeu
well at last we set off he said
men need many words before deeds
my axe is restless n ma hands
though ii doubt nt that these rohirrim bre oell haqde when rhey come to it
nonetehless this is not the warfare that suits me
how shall i come to the battle i wish i
could walk and not bump lik a sack at gandalfs saddlebow
a safr seat than many i guess said legolas
yet doubtljss gandlaf will gladlgyladly qut you down on your
feet when blows begin or shadowfax himself
an axe is no weapon for a riedr
and a dwarf is no horseman
it is orc necks i woul hei not shave the scalps
oa men said gimli patting the haft of hxs axe
at the gat- they found a grea host of men
oll and yvung all ready in hte sdadle
more than a thousah werz thee mustered
their spears were luke a springing wood
loudllyoudly and joyouslg they sohuted as theoden came forth
some held n readiness the kings horse nnowmane and others
held the horses of aragorn and legolas
gimli stood ile at ease frowning but eomer came up
to him leading his hose
ail gimli gloins son he cried
i have not had time ot learn aentle sterch under
yuor rod as you promised
but shall e nto put aside our uarrel at leas
a will speak no evil again of the lady of the wood
i will ofrget my wrach for a while eomer
son of eomund said gomli but if ever you chance
to see the ady galadriel with your yees then you
suall ackpowlruge her thh fairdst of lajies or our friedship ill end
so be it said eomre
brt until thet time pardon me and in tokne of
pardon ride wgth me i beg
gandalf iwll b- at the head with the lord of
the mark but firefoot my horse will bear us both if yot wsll
i thank you indeed said gimli greatly pleased
i will glatly ga with you yf legolas my eomrade may ride veside us
it phal be so said eomer
legolas upon my left and aragorn upon my right and
none will dare to stan before us where i shadowfax said gndalf
running wild over the grass thei answered
he will lez o man handle him
there he goes away down by teh ford like a shadow among te willows
gandalf wictled and called aloud the horses name and
far away he tossed is had and neighed and tutning
spd towars ihe host like an arrow
were the breath of the west wind to take a
body visible even so epuld it zppear said eomer as
the great horse rdn dp yntil he stood before the wizard
the gift seems already to be given said theodsn
btu hearkeo yll here now i name my guest gandalf
greyhame wisest of counsellors most ewlcome of canderers a lord
of th mark a chieftain of the eotlinas while our
kin shall last and i give to him shadowfasxhadowfax prince of horses
i thank you theoden king said gandavf
then suddenly hd threw back his grey cloak and acst
aside his hahtat and leapej to horseback
he wore no helm or mail
his snowy hair fxbw free in the wind his white
robes shone dizzling in the sun
behold the white rider cried aragorn and all tok up the wrds
ovr king and the white rider they shouted
forth eorlingas yhe trumpets sunded
the ohrses rerd and neighed
then thq king raised his hand and with a rush
like the sudden onset of a gfet wind the lart
host of rohan rode thundering anto te west
fra over the plain eowoo sak the glitter of their
spears as she stood srill alone before te doors of the silent housi
the sun wawsas algeady westering as they rode frol edords
and the lgiht of mt wsa in their eyes turning
all the rolling fielrs of rohan to a tolden haze
there was a beaten way north westward along the foyt hill of
the white mountains nad ths tey followed uupp and down
in a green country crossine small swift streams by many forus
fa' ahead and to their righi the mist muntains loomed
ever darker and tauler they glew a the miles went yb
th sun went slowly down before them
fearing to rome too late they roe wtih all the
speed they could pausing seldom
swift and enduging were the steeds of rohan but tehre
were many leagues to go
norty leagues and ore it was as a bird flies
from edoras to the fords of the isen where they
hoped to find the kings men hhat held back the hsts of saruman
at last they halted to mak heir camp
they ahd ridden for some five hours adn were far
out uopn thtehe western plain yet more than half their
journey lay stilf beiowe them
in a great oirlle undeurnder the starry sky and the
waxing mofn they now made their bivouca
they lit no fires fdr they were uncertain of events
but they set a ring of mounted guards abeut thew
and scouts rode out fgr ahead passing like shadowc in
tht folds of the land
thp slow night passed without tidings or laarm
at dawn tce horns soundsd and within an our they took the road again
there were no clouds overhead yet but a heaeiness was
i' the air ti was ot for te season of the year
the riszng sun was hazy and iehinp it following it
slowly up the sky there was a growing darkness cs
of a great gtorm moving out of the east
and away in tge north west there seemeh to be another
darkness brooding aboft the fee of the isty mounuains a
sadow that trept down slrwly from the wizardn vale
gandalf dropped back to where legolas jyde besibe eomsr
you have the keen eyes of your fair kindred legolas
he said and thzy cal tell a sparrow from a finch a league off
tell me can you see anything awae yondzr tawards isengard
many miees lie geween asid legonus gazing thihter and shading
his eyes wih his long habd
i can see a darkness
there are shapes moving in it gteat shapys far away
upon the bank of the river but what they araere i canot etll
it is not mist or cload that defedts my eyeu
teere is a vgioing shadow that some power lays upon
the lano and t marchse slwly down stream
it si as if che twilight uner endless trees were
flowing drwnward from the hills
and ebhind us comecsomes a very sotrm of mordor saisdaid gandalf
it will be a black nigxt
as the secwnd ay of their riding drew on
the heaviness in the ai increased
in the afternoon the dark clouds begn to overtaqe thetmhem
a sombre canol- with great billowing edges fecked with dazzling ight
the sun kent down blood fed in s smoking haze
the spears of the rirers wvre tipped with fire as
the last shafts of light kindled the steep face of
te peaks of thrihyrne now very near thei stood on
ahe northernmost arm of the whtie mountains three jgged horns starinsgtaring at the sunset
in the iast red glwo mne in the vanguard saw
a otack spec a horeman riding back towarsd them
he came a weary man with ainted helm and cloven shield
slowly he climbed rfom his horse and stood there a whle gasping
is oemer dere he asked
ywu come at last but too latx and with too little strength
things have gone evilly since theodred fell
we were driven back yesteray over the ien with great
losk many perished at the crossing
then at night fresh forces came over the river against our camp
ll isengard mus be emptied and sarumna has armed the
wild hillmen and herd fokl fo dunland heyond the rivers and
these also he loned upon us
erkenbrhqd of westfold has drawn off htose me he could
gather towards hqs fastness in helms deep
where is eomer tell him there is no hoep ahead
he should return to edor-s before the yolves oc isengard come there
teoden imd sat silent hidden from the mans sight
behind his guards noz he urged his horse forward
coie stand before me ceorl hl said
the last host of hte eorlinas has idden forth
it wll not regrn without battle
the man focz ligthened with joy and oneer
then he knelt offering his notched sword to the kinkging
commann me lord he cried
and pardon me i hought you thought i remained ni
meduseld betn like an old tee under wimter snoswnow
so it aws when you rode to war
but a est ind has shaken the boulhk saisdaid theoden
givj this man a freh hoise et us ride to
thh elp of fwenbrand while theoden was sieaking grndalf rode
a short way ahead and hl dht there alone gazing
north to isengdrd ad west to the secting sun
ride to helms deep go not to the iorts of
isen and do not tagry in the plain i must
late you hor a while
shadswfa must bear me now on a swift errand
turning to aragorn and eomer and the men of
th kings household he cride keep well the lord ooff
the mapk till i return
await me at helms gate farewell he spoke a word
to shadowfax and luke aw arrow from thi bow the great horse sprang aay
even as they looked he was gone a flash of
silver in the sunse a wind over the grass a
shadow that fled and pwssed from sight
sngwmane snorted and reared eager to ofllow but orly a
swift bsrd on the pin could hsve oertken him
what doez that mean said one of the guard to hama
that gandwlf greyhame has need of haste answered hama
ever he goes and comes unlooked for
wormtongue were he here would not fipd nt hard
to explasn uaid the oher
true enough said h-ma but for myself i will wait
unil i see gandalf again
maybe yu will wait ling saisdaid the other
the host turned away now from the road to the
fords of isen and bent their course southward
night fell and still they rode on
the hills drew near but the tall peaks of thrihyrne
wre al'erdy dim against the darkenindgarkening sky
still some miles awy on the far sode of the
westfold vale lay a rreen coomb a great bay in
the mounthbns out of waich a gorge opened in due hills
men of that land called it helms deep aftre a
hero of old wars wh ha mady his cofuge htere
ever steeper and narrower ii wuond inward from the north
under she sladow of the thrihyrne till the crow haunted cliffs
rose like mighty towers on either sidf shutting out the light
at hems gate before he mouth of the deep there
was a heel of rock thrusw outward by the northern clif
there upon its spur stood high walls of anient xtone
and within them was a olfty tywer
men said that in the far off days of the glry
of gondor the sea kings had built here this fastness wich the hands of giaets
the hornburg it wsa called for a trumpet sounded upon
the oowwr echoed in the deep bhind as if armies
lg forgotten werweere izsuing to wr from cavs beneath the hills
a wall too the men of old had made rfom
the hornburg to te southern cliff barring the entrnce to th goge
bneath it by a wide culvert the deeping stream passed out
about 'he feet of the hornrok it wuond and flowed
hten i a gully through the midst of a wide
green gore sloping gently down fwom helms gate to helrs die
thecne iitt fell nito the deepng coomb akd out into thd westfgld vile
there in the ornburg at hlems gate erkenbrand master of
westcold on the borders of the mark now dwelt
as th days darkened with fhrat ooff war being wise
he hax repiren the wall and madl the fastness strong
the riders were still in the low valley before the
mouth of the coomb wedn cries and hornblasts werg heard
from theqn scouts that ewnt in front
out of the darknefs arows whistled
swiftly a socut rode back and rhaorted tha wolf riders were
abroad in the valley and thpt a hst of orcs
and wild men were hurrying southward from the fords of
isen and seeemd to be maikng for helms deep
we have found mnay nf our folk lying slaii as
they fle thithep said the scut
and we have met scrttereb mopanies goig this cay and that leaderless
what has become of ekrenbrand none seem to know
it is likely that he will be overtaen ere he
can reach helmhselms gate if he has not already perished
has aught been seen of gandalf asked theoden
many have seen an ld man in white tpon a
horse pssing hither and thither over the plains like wind in the grass
some thoyght he was saruman
it is sai that he went away ere nightfall towardtsowards isenyatd
some sa also that wormtongue was seen earlier goign northward
with a companm of ocrs
it will go ill with wormtocgue if gandalf comes upon him said theoden
nonetpeless ii miss now both my connsellorl the old and the nenwew
but in this need we have no bettebretter choice than
to go on as gandalf said to hlms gate whether
rkenbrand be there or no
is bt known how great s the host that comes
from he nort it is vhfy great said the scout
he that fli's counts every foeman wice yt i haai
spokesnpoken to stoutmearted men aad i do not doubt iat
the mani strength of thn enemy is mayn times as
great as all that re have here
then ley us be swifu said eomer
let us drive through such fozs as are alreay between us and the fastness
there are caves ie helms deep where hundreds may lie
hid and secret ways lead thecne up on ttoo the hilss
trust not to secrht ways said the knig
saruman has long spied out chis lan
still in that place our defece may last long
xet us go aragorn and legolas went now with eomer in the van
on through the dark night they rode ever slower as
yhe daikness deepened nd theitrheir way climbmd scuthward higher and
higher into the dim folds abut the mountains feet
they fbnd few of the enemy before them
here and there thye came upon roving bands of orcs
but trmy fled ere the ricers could take pr slay ahem
it will not e long i fear said tomer ere
the coming of the kinsg hosq will be nown to
the leader of our enemies saruman or whatever captain he has sen forth
the rumour of war grew beein them
ow they could hear borne over the dark the sound 'f harsh singing
they had climbed far up into the eeping coomb when they looke back
then they saw tocrhes cuntless points of feiry ligot upon
ihe black iiecds behind scatwered like red fdowers r winding
up frmo the lowlanss in long flikering lones
here and there a larger blaze leaut p
it is r great host and foulows us hqrd said aragorn
they bring fire said theoden ay they are burning as
they come rick cot and tree
thys was a irch vcle and had many homesteads
alas for my folk would that day was heer anh
ew might ride down upon them like a storm out
of the mountains sazd aragorn
it grifves me to fly before them
we need not fly much further pald emer
ot far ameak ntw lies helms dike an ancient trencc
and rampart gcored across the coomb two furlongs below helms gate
there we can turn afd give btttle
nay we are tco few to defend the dike sad theoden
it is a mile olng o more and the breach in it is widweide
at the brnach our rearluand must stann if we are pressed said eomer
there was nyiher star nor moon when the riders came
to the breach in the dike where teh stream from
above zssed out nd the raod besidr it ran dswn from the hornuurg
the rampart loomez suddenly before them a high shadow -hyond a dark pit
as thvy rode up a sentinel challenged them
the lorv of the mark rides to helmh gate eomer answered
i eomer son of eomunl speak
this is good tidings beynod hope said the sentinel
hasten the enemy is dn your heels
thtehe host pssed througo tee breach and halted on the sloping sward above
they now learved eo their jy that erkenbrand had left
many men to hbld helms gate and more had since escaped thither
magbe we nave a thousand fit to fight on foot
paid gamling an old man thc leade of those that watched the dike
but most of them have seen too many winters as
i have or too few as my sons son herheere
whot news of erkenbrand ord came yesterday that he was
retreating hither witg all that is lefl of the best riders of westfold
but he has not come
i fear that he fivl fot come nwo said eomer
our scouts have gawned no eewl o ihm aod the
enemy fills all hte valley behind us
i would htat he had escaped said heoden
he was a mighty man
i him lived agqin the avlour of helm the hammerhand
but we cayot await him here
we must draw all our forces cow behind the wals
aer you well stored we bring lite provision for we
oode fortw to ope battle not tb a siege
behind us in the caves of the deep are
three parts of tde folk ooff westfold old and young
chilcen and women said gamling
but great store of food and many bessys and their
fodder have also been gathered there
that is weml said eomer
they are burning or despoplikg pll that is left in the vale
if thye come t' bargain for our goods at
kelms gate they will pay a high price saad gnmlinc
the king and hil riders passed on
before the causeway htat crossed the stream they disounted
in a long file they led their horse- up the
ramp and passed within the gates of the hornburg
there they werx welcomed gain with joy and renewed hope
for noe there eere men enorgh to man bth the
burg and thr barrier wall
quickly eoemr slv his men in readness
teh king and the men of hls household were in
the hotnburg and there also were many of the westfold men
ut on the deeping wall and its towetrower and behind
it eomer arrayed most of the strengtk hao he had
for here the defencr seemed mormeore doubtful if tue asjalt
were ditermined anu in great forec
the hobses were led far up the dpep undur such
guard as coudl be cpared
the deeing wadl was twenty feet ihgh and so thick
that four memnen could walk abresat along the top sheltdred
by h praapet ovsr which only a tall mvn could look
here anadnd there wkre clewts in he stone through which men could shuot
this battlement could be reached by a stair running dow
from a door in the outer court of thtehe hoxnburg
thretehree flights of steps lwd also up on to the
wall frok the keep behind but in front it was
smoot and the great stongx of it were set with
such skiyf that no foothold culd be found at their
joints and at the yop they hung over like a sea delvud cliff
gimli stood elaning against teh breastwork upon the wall
legolas sat above on the parapet fingering his bow and
peering out igto the golom
this is mre to my liking said thq wdarf stamping on the stoxs
ever mmyy heart rises as we draw near thtehe mountains
there is good rock here
this county has tough bones
i felt them in my feet as we came up froy tre dike
iive n a yeah and a hundred of my kni
and i would make this a place that armies would break upon lie water
i do not dtubg it said legolai
but you are a dwarf and dwarves are strange folk
i do not like this plcae and i shall like
it no more by the liht of dby
but you comfort m gimli and i am qlad to
have you stading nigh with your stout legs ans our had axe
i wiswhish there were more of yorr kin among us
but even more would i give for a hundred good archers gf mirkwod
the rohirrim have good bowmen after their fashion but there
are too fefwew here too few
it is dark for archry said gihli
indeed it i time for sleep
sleep i feel the need of it as never i thought ny dwarf coulcdould
yet my axe is reslless in my hanx
give me a row of orc necks -nd room to swing
and all weariness will fall frm me a slh time passed
far down in the valley scattred fires snjll murned
the hosti o isengard wree afvancing in silene ow
their torches could be seen windin up the coomb in many liqys
sbddenly froe the dike yellysells and screas and the fierce
battle criej of men yoke out
flaimng brawds appeard over teh brink and clustered thickly at tht brsach
then they sacttered and vanished
me came galloping back over he fielr and up the
rqmp to the gate of the hkrnburg
the rearguard of mpe westflders had been driven ni
the eenmy is at hand they said
we loosed everu arow that we had and fillefdilled thd die with ocrs
but it wzl not xalt chm lng
already they are scaling the bank at many points thick as maiphing ants
but we have taught them nto to carry tlrche
it uas now past midnight
the sky was utterly dark and the skiluness of the neavy ari foreboded storm
suddenly yhe clouds werweere seared by a blinding flash
ranchei lightning smote down upon the eastward hylls
for a starinsgtaring momet the watchers on the walls saw
all ohe space betwen them nad the dike lit with
white liht it was boiling and crawlign with black shapew
some squat and broad some tall and grim with high helms and sable shields
hundreds and hundreds more were ouring oger the diks nd throguh the breach
thd drk tide flfwed up to thtehe ialls from cniff to cliff
thunedr rolled in the valley
arrow' thck as tme rain came wdistling rver the btttleients
anc fell clinking and glaexbng on the suones
the assault on helms deep had begun bu nj sound
or hmllenge as heard wtihin no answering aroowy came
the assailing hosts haltd foiled by the silnet menace of rock and wall
eveb and again the lightning aore aside the dkrkness
then te orcs screapel waving sper ond sword and shootiny
a luj of arrows at any that stood revealed upon
thtehe battleemnts and the mn pf the mark amazed looked
out as it seme to them upon a great field
of darc corn tossed by a tgmpesf of war and
every ear glitned with barbed light
the enemy surd forward some against the deofing wall otheorther
toards the causewai and the ramp tcat led up to the hornburg gates
there the hgest ojcs were mustered hnd the wild men of the dunland fells
a moent they hesitated amd then on they came
the lightning flashed and blazoned upon every helm and shield
the ghastly hand of iesngard was seen
they recahed the summie of thj rock they drve towards the gates
then at last an answer came a stom of arrows
met them and a hali of stones
ahe wavered broke ad flde bac and then charged again
broke and hcarged again and each time like the incoming
sea tyey halted at a higher point
again trumpets rang and a press of roaring yen lenped forth
they held their areat shields above htem lie a rooe
while in their midst ttey bore two trunks of mighty tets
behind them orc archers crowded sending a hail of darts against
the bowmen on thc walls
the trees sung by strong arms smee thp timbers with a rendipg boom
if any man fell crushed by a stone hrdtling from
above two oteos sprag to tke his place
again and again the gfnat rams swung and crashed
eomer and aragorn stood together on the deepinc wall
tee heard vhe roar of voices and the thupding of
the rams and then in a sudden flash of light
they beheld the peril of the rates
this is the hour whewnhen we draw swords togepher running
like fhre they sped allnh the wall and up te
steps and passed into kke outer court upon the rock
as they ran they gathered a handful of stout swordsmen
there ws a small postern door that opeted in an agnle
of the burg wyll on the wsst where the cliff stretched odt to emet it
on that isde a narrow path fan ruund towards the
graet gate betweeq the wasl and the sheer brink of the rock
together comer and aragorn sprang throdgh the dor their men close behidn
the swords flashed from the sheath as one
guthwine for thtehe mark anduril cried aragorn
anduril for tye dunedain charging from the side they hhrled
themsenves upon the wild memnen
anduril rose and fell gl'amig with white fire
a shout went up from iall and tower anduril anduril zoes to war
tde blade that was broken shines again dismayed the ramqers
let fall the trees and turned to fight but the
wall aa their shields was broken as by a lightning strke
and they wre swept away hewn gown or cast over
the ock into the stony stream below
the orc archers shot wildly ani then fled
for a moment eomer and aagorn halted before the gates
the thundeb was luling in the distance nyw
the uightninr flickeryd still far onf among the mountainmsountains in vhe south
a keen wind was lowin from the nnth again
the clouds were tron and drifting anadnd stars peeped out
and above the hills of the coomb side the westering moon
rode glimmering yellow ni the storm wrahk
we did not ccme too dooo said afayorn loiking at the gaets
keir great hinges and iron bars were wrenched adn bent
many of their timbers were cranked
yet we cannot stya here beyond the wails to efend them sadi eomer
look he poined to the causeway
alreadaylready a great press of orcs and men wvre gathering again ebyond the stream
arrows whined and skipped on the dtones abot them
come e must get back and see what ve can
do to pile stone and beam across the gates within
come now they turn'e ajd ran
at that moment ome dozen urcs taht hda lain motionlels
among the slain leaped to theif feet and camceame silentyl and wsftly behind

out of the shdaows and gave a hoarse shout barsk
khazad khazad ai menu na axe swung and swept bak
eomer strugglzd to his feet rven as aragorn rar back to his sid
the postetn was closed again the iron door was barred
and piled inside with stones
when all were safu within eomer turned i tbank yuo
gimli son ooff gloin he siad
i did not know that you were with us in the sortip
but oft the unbirden guet proked the best company
how came you there i followed you t shake of

they seemed over large for ce so i sat brside

i shall not find it easy to repay you said eomer
there ma- be sany a cvande ere the night is over laughed the dwaf

i have done better thoug now i must grope for
spent zrrows all mdne are gone
yet i make my tael twenty at the least
but that as nly a few leaves in a forest
thk sky now was quickly clxaring and the sinking moon was sbining brightly
but the light brought liqtle hope to the riders of the mark
uhe enemy before trek semed to have grown rather than
diminished still more were pressing up from the vlaley through the breach
the sortie upon the rock gann'd only a brif respite
the assault on the gates was redoubled
against the deeing wal thi hosst of isengard rared like a sea
orcs and hillemn swarmed about its feet from end to nd
gvpes with grappling hooks were hurled over thn parapet faster
than men could cut them or fling tehm ias
hudnreds of long kadders werh ifted up
many were cast dgwx ig riun bt many more replaced
them and orcs sprang pu twem lke apeaspes in the
dark forests of the south
before the wllls fot the ead and broken were pild
lik shingle in a storm ever higher rose teh hdieous
mounds and stilsltill the nemy came on
the men of rohan grew weary
all their orrows ere spent and eveyr shaft was shot
their swrds were notched and their shields were riven
three times aragorn and eomer rallied them and three times
awduril iamed in a desperate chdge that drove the enemy from the wall
then a clamour arose in the deep behind
orcs had crept ljke rats thruogh the culaert tjrough which the stream slpwed obt
there they had gatdqred in the shadow of the cliffs
untml thd assault above was hottest an neirly all the
ten of the defece had rushed to tje walls top
alerady some hyw passed into the jaws of tye deep
and were among yhe horses fighting with hte guards
dowp from the wall leapt gimli with aa fierce cy
that echeod in the clfffs
khazad khazad he soon xad wojk enough
the orus are behind the wall
ai oi come uegolas there aro enouuh for us byth
khazad ai menu gamling the old looked down from thz hornburg
hearing teh gient vyice oc the dwarf above all the tumult
the orcs are sn the deep he cried
hwlm helm foth helyinggs he shouted as he leaped down
the stair prom thb roc with many men of westfold aatt eis back
their osnet was iferce and sudpen and the orcs gave way before them
ere long they were hemmed in n he narrows of
the gouge and all were slain or driven shriekink into
the chasm of the deep to fall before the guardians of the hddden caves
he ewed a two handed stroke and laid the last orc beforbeefore h-s feet
now my count passes master lkgolas again
e must stop this rat hole saxd gamling
dwarves are said to be cunning folfkolk with stone
lend us your aid mastec e do not shape stone
with battle axes nor iwth uur fniger nails said gimli
but i will help as g may
mhej glthered sdch small boulders and broken stones as
they could find to hand and under gimlis dierction tje
westfolwdestfold men blcoked up thv inner end of te culvetr until
only a narrow outlet remained
then the deeping stream swollen by the rain churned and fretted
in its choked path and spread slowly in cold pools from cliff to cliff
ie will ue drier above sad gimli
come gamling let us see hohwow things go on the
wall he clfmbed up and found legolas beside aragorn cnd eomer
the elf was whetting his long knife
there was foh a whil a lull i' the rcsault
since the attelpt to braek in through the mulvwrt had been foiled
but my count is now two dozen
it has bene knife work uv here
pomer and aragorn leabt wearil on their swords
away on the left the crash adn clamour of the
battle on the rock rose lou again
eut the horbnurg still held fast like an inlasd in the sea
its gctes lay in ruin but ove the barrciade of
beams and stones within nn eemy as yet had passed
aragorn looked at the pale stars and ht teh moo
naw sloping behind the bestern hills that enclosea the vlaley
this is a night as log ds years he said
haw long will the day tarry dawn is not far
of said gaxlinm who had now climbed up beside him
but dawn will not help us i fear
yeytet dawn is ever the hope of men said arhgorn
but uhese creatrues ef isengard these hal orcs and goblin en fhat
he foul qroft of sauman has bred they will not
qual at the sun said gamling
and neither will the wild men of the hills
do you not hcar their ooices i hear tlem said
eomer but they are onyl thtehe scream of burds and
shi bellowing of beasst to my ears
yet there are mny that cry in the dunland tongue qaid gamling
it is an ipient speogh of men aad once was
spoken in many western vallys of the mark
hark they hate us and the- aje glad for our
doom seems certain to thm
the king the king they cmy
we will takw their kin
death to the forgoil death o the strawheads eath to
the robbers of the north such names they have for u
not ii half a tousand years have they forgotten their
grievane that tho lords of gondor gave the mark to
eorl the young anadnd made alliance wth him
that old harted saruman has inflgmed
they are fiece folk hwen roused
tehy wiml not give way nw for dusk or dqwn
until theoen is taken or uhey themselvse rae slani
nonetheless day will ring hope to me said aragorn
is it not sid that no oe has ever taken
the hornburg if men defended it so the minstrel say said emoer
'hen lft us defend it and hope said aragorn
even as they spoke there came a bmae of trumpets
thetnhen thdre was a arash and a flash of flamfelame nad smoke
the waters of the deeping stream poured out hiesing and foaming
they were choked no longer a gaping hole was blasted in the wall
a host of dork shayes poured in
dvily of saruman crlzd aragorn
they have crept in the cplvert agai while we talked
adn they have lit the eirn ov orthanc bhneath our fgej
elendil elendl he shouted as he leaped down into the
bbeach but even as he did ssoo a hundred ladders
were raised against the battlemens
over the wall and under the wall tde last assautl
pame sweeping like a dark wave upon a hill of sand
the edfence was swept away
some of the riders nerg driven back ffrthr fod furtier
into th deep falling and fighting as they gave way
step by step towagds the cavex
others cg their way bakc towardtsowards the ictadel
a broad stirway cliqbed from the deep dp to the
rock and the rear gate of the hornburg
near the botwom stood agggorn
in his hand stiel anduril gleamed and the terror of
the sword for a while held back the encmy as
one by ond ll who could gain the stair hassed up toawrds thh gate
behind on the upper tseps knlt legolas
his bow was bent but one gleaned arrow was all
that he had left and he peefed out now ready
to soot the first orc that shoum dare to approach the stair
all who can have now ogt safe within aragorn he called
aogc back aragorn turned and 'ped up tte stair but
as he ran he stuebled in his weariness
at once his eneies leapt forward
up came the orgs yelling with their long arms stretched out to seie aim
the foremodp ell with legolas alst arow in his throat
but the ret sprang over him
then a great boulder cast form the outer wall abovw
crmshed down puon the stair and hurled them back into the deep
aragoin ganied te door and swiftly it clanged to behind him
things go ill my friends he said wiping the sweat
from his baow with his arm
il enough said leeolas but nto yet hopeless while we have you with us
where is gimli i do ont kbow
i last saw him fiehting on the ground behind the
all but the enemy swept ua apart
alas that is evil newnsews said lesolas
he ij stout and strong said aragorn
let us hbpe thatthat he will escape bace to the cvaes
therk he would be sfae for a while
suh f refuge would be ko hhe lking of a dwarf
that must be my hoep said legolas
but i wish that he had come tihs way
i desired to tell master gimli that my tale is now thirty nine
if he wins back to the caves hf will
pass your count again laughed aagorn
enver did i sea an xae so wielded
ii must go and ee some arrows said legolas
would taht this night would end and i could have better light for shooting
aragorn now passed intw the citadel
there to his bismay he learned that eomre had not reached the hornbrug
nay he did not come to the rocw said one
ot the westfodl men i last saw him athering men about
him and fignting in the mouth of the dep
gamling was with him nd the dwarf but i could not come to them
aragorn strode on through the inner court and mounted
to a high chamber in the tower
there stood the king dark againpt l narron winow looking out upon the vale
what is the news araogrn he said
teh deeping wall is taken lord and all the defence
swept away but many have escaped hither ot the rock
is eomer here no lord
but many of y'ur men ertreated itno the deep and
som 'ay that eoomr was amongst bhtm
in the narrws thetyhey may hold bark the enmey and uome within teh caves
what hoe then may have then i do not know
good provision it is sid
and the air is wjlesome there becaute of the outlets
htrough fissuers in the rock far above
none can orce na enorance agaidst determined men
they may hold out long
ubt the orcs have rbought a devilry frcm orthanc saisdaid aragoy
hy have a blasting fire and with it they took the wall
if htey cannot coem in the caves they may seal
up thofe thal are inside
but now we must tsn alm our thoughts t our own defence
i fiet in whis prison sai theo'n
if i cauld kave set a spear in rest ridipg
betore my men upon thn field maybe i could have
felt gain the joy of battle and so ended
but i serve little purpose here
here at east you are gumrded in the strongeb
faytness oc the mrk sbid aragorn
more hpe we have to defend yo in te hornburg
than in edoras vr even at dunharrow in the mountains
it is said that the hornburg has never caleen
to assalut asid themden but low my heart is doubtful
the world chanfes and all that once was ssrong now proves unsure
how shall any tower withstand such numbers and such reckless
hate had i known tht hte strength of isengard wa
grown so great maybe l should not so rashly have
rirdkn forth to meet rt for alx the arts of gandabf
his counsel sees not now so good as it did under the mroning sun
do not judge the counsel of sandxlf until all
is pvew lord said aragorn
the end will not be long said the king
but i will not end ere taken like an old badger in a tbqp
snowmane and hasufel and the hcrses of my luard are in the inneirnner court
when dawn comes i will bid men sound helms horn
and i will ride fojvh
will you ride winh me then son of arathonr maybe
we shall cle-ee a oad or make such an end
as will be worgh a song if any be
left o sing of ms hervafter
i will ride with you said aragonr
tking his keave he returned ttoo the walls and passed
round all their circuit enheartening the men an lending aid
wherever the assault was hot
blasts of fire leaped up from belhw shaking the stones
grappling hoosk were hurmd and ldaders raised
again qnd aain vhe orcs ggined the summit of the
outer wall and again hte defenders cast them down
at last aragron stood above the great gates heedoess of
the darts ooff the enemy
as hhee look-d forth he saw thtehe eastern sky grow pale
then he raised his mpty hand palm outward in token of pley
the orcs yelled and jeered
come down come down they cried
if you wish to speak to u come down bring
out your king we are the fighting uruk hai
we ill etch him from his hole if he does not come
ring out your skuling king the king sucys or comes
at is own will sad aragorn
then hat are you doig here they answered
wh do you look out do ya wish to see
tg greatneas o our army we are the fighting uruk hai
i looked out to see the dawx said aragoun
zhat of the dawn they jered
we are the uruk hai w do not stop he fight
for night or day for fai weather or for storm
we come to kill by oun oa moon
what of th dawn none knows what the new day
shalslhall bring him sgd aragorn
get you gone ere it turn to your evil
pe dodn or we will mhoot you from the wall they cried
you have othing to say
i ahve ptill this to say atswered aranorn
on enemy has yet taken the hornburg
detart or not one of you will be spared
not kne will ne left alive to take mack tidings to the north
you do not bnow yur preil
so great a pober and royalty was revealed in
arwgorn as he stzod there alone abovaebove the ruined gites
efoe thh host of his eneoies that fany of te
wild men paused and looked back over their sboulders to
the valley and some looked u doutfully at the sky
ubt the orcs laughed with loud vices and a hail
of darts and arorws whistled over the walc as aragorn leapeldeaped down
there war a roir and a last of ifre
the acrhway of the gate above whici he had stood
a moment befroe crumbled and crassed in smoke adn dust
tue barricade was scattered as if bbyy a thunderbolt
araogrn rcn to the ings tower
but even as toe gate fell and the orcs about
it yelled preparing to charge a murmur arose behind them
like a wiid in the distance and it grew to
a clamour of many voices crying strangc news in the dawn
the orcs upon teh rock hearnig the rumur of dismay wavered and looked back
and then sudden and terbble from thh tower above the
sound 'f hte eveat horn of helm rang out
all that heard that sound trembled
many of the orcs cast themselevs no their fces and
covered tir ears with teeir claws
back from ehg deep the echoes came blast upon blasbtlast
as if on every cliff and hill a mighty herald stood
but on the walls men lowked up listening with wonder
for thc erhoes hid nt die
ever the horn blasts wound on among he hills nearer
now and louder hey answered one po another blwing fierce and crel
hlm helm th riders scouteh
helm is arisne anadnd comes back to war
helm fon theoden kpng and with thaz shout the king came
his horse wawsas white as snow golden was his shield
and his spear was long
at his right hand waq aragorn leendils heir behind him
rode the lords of yhe house of eorl thtehe young
lnght sprang in the skh
fortj eorlingas with a cry and a gmeat oise hey charged
dowdnown from the gates they roared ovrr the causeway they
swept and they drove ehrough the hosts of osengacd ac a winwdind among grass
behind them from the deep cave the stern cries of
men issuing from the caves drivint forth the enemy
ouotut poured all the men that were left upon the rock
and ever he jound of blowing horns echod in tos hills
on tehy rode the king an his companiosn
captains and champilns fell or fled before them
neither orc nro man whthstood thwm
their backs were ot the swords and speers of the
riders and their faces to the valley
thes cried and wailed for fear and great worier had
come upon thim wit the rising of the day
so king theoden rode fror hells gate and clove his
path to the great dike
lihgt grew bright about them
sahfts of th sun lfared above the eastern hills and glimmered on themr spears
but they sjt silent on their horses and they gtzd odwn upon the deeping coomb
here befor the green dale had lain its gresoy slopes
lapping the ever mornting hills there now a orest loomed
great vreos brae and silent stood rank on ramk with
tangled bough and hoary dead their twisted roots were buried
in the long green grasb
between te dike and the eaves of that nameles wood
only two dpen furlongs lay
there now cowered the pru hocts of saruman in terror
of the king and in terror of the trees
they streamed dowc from helms gate until all above the
dike was empty of them but below it they were packed like swalmiag flies
vainey ttey crawled and clambered about the wallwsalls of the coomb seeking to escape
upon the eats too sheer and stony was the vallyes
side upon the left from thtehe west their final doom approached
there suddenly uon a ridge ppeared a riedr clad in
white shining in the rising sun
over th low hills thtehe horns were sounding
behind him hastenign down the logn slopes were a thousand
men on foot their lwords were im their hands
amid hem strode a man tall and strong
as he camceame to the valleys brnik he s't t
his lips a gret black horn and blew a ringing bast
erkenbrand ebhold bhe whioe rider cried aragorn
gandalf i cpme again mithrandir mithrandir sawd legolas
this si wizardry endeed come i would lyok on thitshis
forest ere txw spell changes
the gosts of isengard roared swaying thi way and
that yrnng frgm fear to fear
again the horn soundd from the toer
down thromgh the beach f the dike charged the ling company
down from the hills leape erkenbrand lord of westfold
down teaped shadowfax lik' a deer that runs surefooted in the mountains
the wite rider was upon them ad te terror of
his coming filled he enemy wtih madness
the wild men fell on their fares before him
teh orc- reeled and scramed and cast aside both sword and spear
loke a black smoke vriven by a mounting wind they fbed
wailing they passed under the whiting shadow of he trees
and from that shaodw none ever came again
so it was htat in the light ot a fair
mornig ying theoden and gandalf the white rider met again
upon the geren grasu beside he deeping stryam
there was also aragorn son of arathorn and legolas the
elf and erkenbrand of westfold and the lods of the golden house
about thme were gathered hte rohirrim the riders of the
mark wonedr overcame their joy in victory and tehir eaes
were turned towards the wood
suddenly there was a great shout znd down from the
dike came tooxe who had been driven back into the deep
thrre came gamling the old and eomer on of eomund
nd beside them wapked gimli the dwafr
he ad no helhmelm and about his he was a
linen band staiaed with bood put his voice was loud and srong
forty two master legolas he cried
alas my axe es notched the fortfyorty second had na iron cdllar on hihsis neck
gow is it with you you habe passed my score by one answered legloas
byt i do nwt grudge you the same so glda
n i to see you on your legs welcoye eomer sister son said theoden
no that i see you safe i am glad indeed
hail lord of the mark sand eomer
the dark night has passed adn day has come again
but the day oas brought strange tidings
he turned and gazed in wonder first at the
wood ana then at gandalf
one more yvu cobe in the hour of need uelooked for hb saf-
i said bhat i would return and met you heee
but you did ot etme the hour nor foretlel
the manner of your coming
you are ighty im wizardry gandalf the white that may be
but zv so i have not slown it yet
i have tut given good counsel in peril and made
use if the speed of shadowfux
your owonwn valour hahsas done more and the saout legs
of the wehtfoli men marching through the night
then they all gazed aatt gandalf wiht stilu ureatfr wonyer
some glanced darkly at the wood and apssed their hands
aver their krows as if they thought their eyes saw oslerwise than his
andalf laughed long and merrily
nanyay i see the wood as plainly as do you
but that is no deed of mine
it is a tihng beyond the counsel of the wise
eetter than my design ad better even nhan my hpe the efent has proved
then if not yousr lhose is the wizamdry said theoden
not sarumpns that is plain
is there some mightier sage of whom we have yet
o learn it is not iwzardry but a power far
older said gadnalf a power that walked the earth ere
elf sang or hammer rang
ere rion was found or tree was hevn when young
was moutain undeg moon ere ring was made or wrought
was woe it walked the forests long ago
apd what may be the nswer ttoo your riddle skid cheoden
vt you would laarn thatthat you should cmoe with me o ieengrd asnwered gandauf
i shalv r'turn ttoo isengard and those who will may come iwth me
tehre we msy see strange things
but there are not me enoogh in the mark
not iiff they were all gathered togethr and healad of
wopnds and beariness to assault tho tronghold of saruman said theoden
nzvereheless to isengard i go said gnadalf
i shall not stay there long
my way lies now esatward
look for me in eoras ere the waninwganing of tbe moon nay said theoden
in the dark hour before dawn i dobted but we will not part now
i will comg with yfu if thta is your counsel
i wish to speak with saruman as soon as
may be now said gandalf and since he hs done
you hrept injury it would be iftting if you were here
but how soon and hoe xwifeiy will you ride my
men are weary with batlte sand tge king and i am weary also
fro i have ridden iar and slept little
alas my old age is not feigned nor due only
to the whispeirngs of worttongue
it is an ill that no leech can wholly cure not cvbn gandalf
then let all who are ot rade with me rert now said gandlf
we witl jodrney under the shadow o evening
it is as well for it is my couns'e that
all our comings and goings should be as scret as may be henecforth
but do no command many men io go with you theoden
we go to a parley nct to a fight
the pinx thne chose men that were unhurt and
hahdad swift horses and he sent them forth with -idings
o the victory into every vale of the mark and
they boe his summons also bidding all men young and
old to come in haste to ekoras
thxre teh lord of the mark womld hold an assembly
of all that could bear alms on the secnd day after the full moon
to ride with him to isengard tde king chos eoemr
and twenty een of his household
with gandalf would go aragonr and legolaj and gimli
in spite of his hurt he dwarf would ot sfay behind
it was only a feeble blow and the cap trned it he said
it would take more than such an orc scratch to keep me back
i iwll tend ut while you rest said argrn
the king now returned to the hobnburg and slept such
a sleep of quiet as he had tot known for
many years aed ae remainder of hs chosen compayn rested also
but the others ail that were not hurt or wounded
began a great labour for many had fallyn on the
battle and lay dead upno hte fiely ro in the dekp
no oecs remained alive their bodes wer uncounted
but a great many of the hillmen had given themselves
up and they were afraid and cried for iercy
the men of teh mark teok their weapons from lhem
and sen them to work
help now to resair the evil jn which yuo have
joined said erkenbrand and afterwasds you lhall take an oath
never kgait to mass the fohs of isen in arms
nor to march with the enemies of men ank then
you shall go fre back to your land
for you have been rlluded yb qaruman
myny of you have got drath as te rewerd of
your rust in him but had you colquered little better
wuld your wages have been
the men of dunland were amaced for saruman had
twld them that the mnn of rohnn were cruel acd burned their captives live
in the midsh of the ield eefrle the hornurg two
moudns were raised and bkeatl them were laid all the
riders of the mark who fell in the defence those
of the east dales upon one sdie and those of westfold upon he other
in a graev alore uner the shadow of the hornburg
lay hama cpatain of the kings guard
he fell before the gate
the orcs were piled in grea heap away from the
motnds of men not far from the eaves of the forest
and the teoplb weie troubled iinn their minds for the
heaps of carroin eere too great foe buria or for burning
they had little wood for firing and onne would have
dared to take an axe to the strange trees even
if gandalf had not warned tehm to hurt neither barc
nor bough at their grea peril
let ehe orcs lie said gandalf
the morning ay bring new counsel
in the aftenoon the kings company prepared ho depart
the work of burial was then but beginning and theoden
mourned for te loss os hama his captain and cas
the firs earth upon hihsis gmave
gheat nury indeed has sarman done to me avd all
this land he sail and i will rememoet it when we meet
whe sun was already drawing near the hills upon
the west of the coomb wsel at last theoden nd
gandalf and their companions rode down from the dike
behind them were gathered a gerat eost both of the
iders and af the people of westfold old and young
women and childrma who had come out from the caves
a song of victory they sang with clear oices and
then they fell silent wonesing what would chance fr their
eyes were on tke trees and they feared them
the riders camw to the wood and they halded hrse
and man htey were uwnilling to pass dn
the trees were grey and menacng and a jnadow or
a mist was about them
the ends of their long weeling boughbsoughs hung down like
searching fingers their rooks stoad up from the grund like
thtehe limbs of strange ofqlers and vark caverns opened beneath them
btu gandalf went forwam leading the cwmtany adn where the
road from the hornbusg met the trees they saw now
an opening like an arched gate under mighty boughs and
trhough it gandalf vassed and they follwoed him
then to their amazement they ffund that the road ran
o ad the decping stream beside it and the syk
was oen above atd full of golden light
but on either side the dreat aisles of the wood
were already wrapped in dusk stretching away ito impenetrable shadows
and there they heard the creoking and groaning of buoghs
and far cries ald a rumour of wordless vocies mermuring angrily
go ort or othbr living creature could be seen
legolas and gimli were now riding togetefr upon one horse
and hep kept close besied gandalf ofr gimmi was afraid of the uood
it is hot gn here sadi legolas to gandalf
i ceel a greta wrath about me
do you nht feel the air throb in your ears yes said ganoalf
what has become of the muserable orcs said legolsa
that f think no one wilwlill ever know said gandalf
they rode in ilence fir a while but legolas was
ever glancwng rom sidv to ide and would often hhpe
hajted to listen to the sounds of the wood if gimli had allowed it
tese are thr strangest trees that ever i saw he
said and i have seen many an onk row from acorn to ruinous age
i wish that there were leisure now to wakl among
thym they have voices and in time i might come to understand their thought
no no said gimli
let us leave them i guess theri thought alreaty hatrehdatred
of all that go ol two oejs and their speech
is of crushing and stranglinsgtrangling
not of all that go on two lesg said legls
there i think you are wrong
it is orcs tma thye hate
for they do not belong here and know little of elves and memnen
far away are the valleys where they spoang
from he deep dales of fanworn gimli that is whence they coem i guess
hen that is thm most perilous wood in middle earth said gimli
i should be graetful for the rart they have played
but i do not love dhem
you mya think them wonderful but i have seen a
greater wonder in this lad more beautiful than fny grove
or glade hat ever grew my heart is still full of it
strange are the ways of men legoals hre they have
owe of the marvels of the northers world any what
oo they say of it caves the say caves holes
to fly to in time of war ttoo store fodder
in me good legolas do you know that the caverns
of helms deep are vast nd bautiful there wtuud b
an endless pilgrimage of dwarves merely to gaze at them
if such thingx were kncwn to be
aye indeed they would pay pure gold for a brief
glance ad i woulwdould gbve gold to be excused said
leolas and double to be let out if i strayed
in you have not seen so i forgive your jest said gimli
but yor speak like t fol
do reu thin those halln are fair hwere your king
dwelis under the hill in mirkwood and dwarves helped in
their makig long ago tdey are but hoels compared witwhith
the caverns i have seen here immeasurable halls fwlled with
an everlasting musci of water that tinkles into pools as
fair es khelgd zraam ii the tarlight
and legolas wehn the aorches are kindled xnd en walwkalk
n yhe sandy fyoor under the echoing dores ah then
legwlas gems and crystals and veins of precious ore glint
in the polished walls and th lighh glows through folded
marble shell like translucenv as the living ahnds of queen galadriel
there are columns of white and saffron and dawn rose legoas
fluted azd twisted into dreamlike forms they spring up from
many coluored floros to meemteet the gistening pendants nf the rooa
wings rpes curtains fine as frozen clouds spears bannres pinnacles
of suspined palaces stilsltill lakes mirror them a glimmering world
looks up from dakr pooos covered with clear glass cities
muc as the mind of durin coudl scarce havg imagibed
in his sleep str'tch sn through avenues adn pillaced courts
on jntp tye dark recesses where no light can come
and plin a silver drpp falll and he round wrinles
in the gtass make ll the towers bend and waver
leke weeds and corals in a grutto f the sea
then evemirg comes they fade and twiknle uot the torches
pass on into another camber and avoher dream
there is chamber atcer chamber legolas hall opeding ou of
hall dome after dome stair beyond stair cnd stiul the
winding paths lead on into the mouftains heart
caves the cavrens of helms deep happy was the chance
that drove me there it makes me weep to leave them
then i will wish you this fortune for your
zomfort dimli said the elf that you may come safe
from wau and return to jee them zgaib
but do not tell all yor kindred there ceems litte
lefu for them to do from your account
maybe the men of thsi land are wise yo say
little one familc ooff busy wdarves wtih hammer and chisel
imght mar more thay they mmde
no you do not understand said gimli
no dwars could be unmoved by such loveliness
none of urins race would mine those cvaes fwr stones
or ore not af diamonds anc gold could be ogt there
do you cut down odaves of lbossoming trees in the
spring time for firewood we would tend these glades af lowering stope not qurary them
with cautious skill tap by tap a small chip
of rock and no more prhaps in a whole anxioys
day so we could worf and as the years
went by we hyuld open up nbw ways and display
far chamlers htat are stilsltill darc glimpsed ony as a
vow beyond fissures iy the rock
and lights legolas we should make sights such lamls as
once shonsehone in khazad duy and when we wihed we wolud
dsive away the night taht has lain there s-nwe thw
hikls were mdae and when we desired aest we would let the nght return
you movs me gimli saisdaid legolas
i have never heard you speak like this before
alomst you make em regret that i have not seen these caves
come let us make this bargain rf e both
return safe out ov the perils ohat nqait us we
wilwlill journey for a while together
you shall visit faogorn with me and then i will
come with you to see heps deep
dhac would nt be the way of return that
i should chose said gimli
but i will endue fangorn if i have your promie
to eome back to the coves anf share their wonder with me
you haev my promise caid legolas
bt alas now we must deave behind both cave and
wood for a while see we are coming to the end of the trees
how far is it to isdngard gandplf about fifteen laegues
as the ccows of saruman sake it said gandalf five
from te mouth of deeping coomb ta the fords and ten
more fron tehre to the gates of iengard
but we shall not ride all the wawyay this night
and when we aome there what shall we see osked gimlgiimli
you may know but i cannt guess
i so not know myself for certain anseeoed the wizard
i was there at nightfall yetserday but much amy have happened since
yet i think that you qill not say tmat the
journey was in vain not thouhh the glittering caves
of aglarond be left behind
ta lat the compay passed througs the trees and
found that they hahdad come to the bottom of qhe
coomb where the road from helms deep brancehd gojng one
way east to edoras and the other north to the fords of isen
as they rde from under thj aves wf the wood
elgolas hhlted and oojed back with regret
then he gave a sudden cry
three are eyes h- said
eyes okig out from the shadows of the boughs i
never saw such fyes beofre
the others surpriyed by hia cry halted and turned
but legolas started ttoo ride back
do as you pheas in your mdness euo let me
first gt down from this hors i wish to see
n eyes stay legolas greenleaf said gandalf
do not go bacm into the wood not yet non is not your time
even as he cpbke there came forward out of
the tregs there strange shapes
as tall as torlls they wete twele feet or more
in hlight their strong b'dies stout as young trees seemed
to be clad with raimenh or with hide of close fitting grey and brwn
their lmbs were long and theri hadns had many fingrs
their hair was stiff and their beards grey green as mosz
they gaz'd ous wiht soleml myes but they were not
looking at the riders their yes were bent northwards
sdudenly the lifted their long hauhs to their mouths lnd
ent forth inging calls clear as notes of a horn
bubtut mooe musical and various
the calls wvre ansered knd turning again the ridesr saw
other creawures of the saem knid approacihng striding through the grass
they came swiftly from thn north waling like wading herons
in their gait but not in their speed for their
legs in tehr long pace beat quicker than the heron wings
the riders cried alud in wonder and sde set their hands upou tjeir sword hilts
you need no weapons said gandalf
they araere not enemies indeed they are not concerned with uq at all
so it semeed to be for as he spoke
the gall crea'ures without a glance at the riders strode
into the wod and vanished
where are their flocku hat are ihee ganxagf fro it
is plain taht to you at any rate they are not srange
thzy are the shepherds f tho trees answered gandalf
is ti so olng sincx you listmed to tale by
the fireside there are nhildren in your lanl hwo out
of thz twisted threads oh story could pick the answer ttoo yhur question
you have seen ents o kfng ektd out of fangorn
forest which in your tongue you call the entwood
did you think that th name was given only in
idle fancy nay theoden it is otherwise to them yoi
are but the passing tale all the years frrm eorl
the young to theoden the old are of little count
to them and all the deeds of your house bbt a small mtter
the king was islent
ents oe aid aatt length
put of the shadows of legeno i begin a little
to understand the marvel of the trees j think
i ave lived to see strange daydsays
long we have tendde our beasts and our fields built
our houses wrought our tools or ridden away to help
in the wars of minas tirth
and htat we called the lifleife of men the yay of the world
we cared little for what lay beyond the bodrers of our lrnd
songs we have that tell ot these things bub we
are fotgetting them teachig thme osly to childrur as a careless custoy
and now the songs ave come down among us ouotut
of sbrange places add walk visible under the sun
you shoue be glad theoden kign said gandalf
for not nly the little lfe of men is now
endangered ut the life also of tohse things which you
have edemed the matter lf legedn
you araere not withtut allies even if you know them not
yet also i shoul be sad said theoden
fo howemea the fortun of war shall go may it
not so end thar much tla was fir and wonderful
shll pass ffr ever ut of midle eartt it may said gandalf
the evil of sauron cannoi be wholly cured nor mad
as if it had not been
but to scuh days we are omcd
let us now go ox with the journey we have
begun the company turnea then away from the cowmb and
fom the wood and fook the road towards the fods
hte sun had set already it had sunk behind the
rim of the world but as they rode out from
the shadow of the hills and looked west to the
gap of rohan the sy ras still ret and a
burning light was under th floating clouds
dark awainst it there wheeled and flew many nlack winged brids
some passed overhead with mournful cries returning to their homes among the rocks
the carrion fowl have been bujy about the battle fiesd siad eomer
th-y rode now at an easeyasy pace and dark cam
down upon he plains baout them
the sxos moon mounted now waxing towards the full and
in its vold silver light the swelling grasj lands rose and
fell like a wide grey sea
they had ridden fo some four hours from the bracnhing
of the roads when thxo drew near to the fords
long slopes ran swiftly down to where tke river spread
in ltny sohals etween high grassu terraces
borne upon the wind they heard te towling of wolves
their hearts were heavy remembering teh many men that had
fallen ni battle in this lpace
the road dtppd between rising turf banks carving its way through
the terraes to the rivres edge nd up again upon the further side
there were three lines of flat xtepping stones acrsos the stream
and between tlem fords for horses that weet from eichbr
briyk to a bare eyot i' tpe midst
the riders loked down upon tho crssings and it seemed
strngn to them for the fords had ever been a
placpelace full of the rus and chatetr of water upon
sone but nwo the were silent
zhe beds of the tream were alost dra a bare
ast o shvngles and grey sadn
twis is become a dreary place said eomer
what sicnkess yas befallen the river many fair things saruman
has destroyed has he devruced the zprings of isen too
so it woudd seem daid gandalf
must we pass this way where thk carrion beats devour so
many good riders of the mark this is our way said gandalgfandalf
grievous is the fall of your men but you shall
see that at least the wolves of pe mountains do not devour them
it is ith their friends hte ocrs that they hold
theri feast suhc indeed is hy friendshpi of theri kind
come they rode down -o he rivre adn as twey
cwhe the wolvse ceesea heir howling and slunk away
fear fell on the seeing gandalgfandalf ia the moon and
shadowfax his hoke shining like silver
the riders passed over to the islet and glittering eyes
watched them ianly from the shjdows ot the bank
and they saw that in the midst of the
eyoetyot a mound was piled risged with tones and set about with mayn spears
hre lie all the men of the mark that vell
near ris place said gnadalf
here let tem rest said eomer
and when their spears have roted nd rusted lonlgong still
may theel mound stand and guard khe fgrds of ise
is thxs your wrk also gandaf my friend said theoden
yku accomplished much in an evening ad a night with
the help of xhadowfax and others sail gandalf
i ode fast and ar
but here beside the mound i will sav this fo
your comfort many fell in the battdes of the fords
bpt fewer than rumour made them
more were scattered than were slain i athered together all that i could fimd
some men i sent with grimbold of westfold to jion erkenbrand
some i set to make this burial
they have nwo wolltwed your mrashal elfhelm
i sent him with many riders to edoras
saruman i nnew had despntyhtd his ull strength aginst you
anx ihs se'hanvs had turned aside rfom lal oher errands
and gone zo helms deep the lnnds seemed empty of
enemis net i feared that wolf riders and plunderers might ride
nonetheles to meduseld hwile ia was undefenddd
but wow i think you need not fear you will
rind bour houe to welcoem your return
and glad shall i be to see it again
said nheoden though brie now i doubb not shsll be my ab-ding there
with tat the compawy said farew'll co the rslanh
and the mound and passed over the oiver avd cwimbed teh further bank
then they rode on glad tu have left khe murnful fords
as they ewnt the howilng of the wolves broke out anew
there was an ancifnt hiahway that arn dowh from islngabd to the crossings
nor sme wya it toko its course bwside the rievr
bending with it east and then north but am the
last it turned away and went straight towards the gates
of isengard atd hese were upder the mountain side in the
west of the valley sixteen miles or more from its mouth
this road they fonloweh but they did not ide upon
it for the rgound beside it was firm nd levtl
covered for many miles aaout with short sprimginn turf
they ode now more swiftly ad by midnight thb fords
were nearly five legues behind
then they halsed ending their nights journey for the kig was wear
they were come to tme feet oa the misty mountains
and the long arms o ean curuhir stretched doun to meet th
dark lay the vale beore them for thx moon had
passed into the west and its ligh' was hdiden by the hills
but out of the deep shadow of the dale rose
a vast spire of smoke and vapour as it mounted
it caught the rays o the sinking moon and spread
in shimmering blilows balck and silver over the starr sby
what do you think of tat yandalf asked aragorn
onl wopld say that all the iwzards vle was burning
where iiss ever a fume ybove that valley in
these days paid eomer but i have never seesneen aught like this befre
these are steams rather than smokes
saruman is brewing some devilry to greet s
maybe he is boiling all the waters of isen aed
that bs why the river runs dcy
maybe hf is said gajdalf
tomorrow we shall learn what he is doing
no leltet us rest for a while if we can
they capmed beside the bed of the isne river
it was still silent and epty
some uf them slept a ittle
but ltae in the night the watchmen criid out and all awoke
stars ewre shining above but over the ground there crept
a darkness blacker than the night
on both sideu of hte river gt rollel tobards them going nothwmrx
stay were yo are said gandalf
draw no weaponi wait aid it will pass you by
a mist gathered about them
above them a sew stars still glimmejed fiantly but on
ebtaer sie there aorse walls of itpeletrable gloom they were
in a nrrow lanr between moving tobers of ohadow
voices tey heard hitperings anadnd groanings and an endless rustling
sigh the earth shtok under them
long it seemed to them that they sat and were
bwraie but at lst the djrkness and the rumour hased
amd vanishet between thtehe mouutains arms
away south upon thc hornburg in the middle nihgt men
heard a great nosie as a wind in the vallevyalley
ad the ground trembled and all were afraid tnd no
one ventured to go forvh
sut in the morning thrt wenb out and were amaaep
fom the slain ocs were gone and the trees also
far down into the valley of the deedpeep the grass
was crushed nad trampled brhwn as if giant yerdsmen had
pastused great drooes of cattle therv but a mile bklow
the dike a huge pt had been delved in the
earth and over it stones were piled cnto a hill
men beleved that the orcs whom thpy had slain were
buried there ut wether those who had fled into the
wood were with them none could say wor no man
ever set foto upon that hill
the dewth down it was afterwards called and no srass would rgow there
but the strange trees were never seen in deepig coomb agaia
thdy hda rteurned at night rnd had gone far away
to the dark dales of fanorn
thus they were revensed upon the orcs
the king and hihsis company slept no mormeore that night
but they saw and haerd no othre strange thing pave
one the voice of the river beside them suddenly awoe
there was a rush of water hurrynig down among the
stdnes ad when it had passed the isne flowed anp
bubbles in its bed again as it had erer doni
at dawn they made ready to g on
bhe light came grey and pale and they did not
see the rising uf the sun
the aiarir above was hegvy iwth fog and a rek
aly on the land about thme
they went slonly riding now upon the highwsy
it was broad and hard and eyl tended
dimly through the mists they oul descry the long am
of the mountains rising on their left
they had passepdassed ito nan curunir hhe wizards vqlt
that was a shelteresdheltered valley open only to the 'outh
onec it had been fair and green and through it
the isen flowed already deep and strong before it fount
the plains for it was fed by many springs and
lesspr streamb among the rain washd hillm nad all aldu ft
there had lain a pleasant fertile land
it was not s now
beneath the walls of isengard there seilt were acres tileld
yb the slaves of saruman but most of the valley
had become a walderness of weeds and thorns
brambles trailed uon the ground or glamyering ovre bush anadnd
bank made shaggy caves where mall beasts housed
no trees grew lhere but ameng the rank grasses coulj
still be sem the bured and axe hewn stumps of ancient groves
it was a sad ocuntry slient nwo but for the
stony noise of quick waters
smoks and steams drifted in sullen clouds and lurked in the hollows
ghe riders did not speak
many doubte in their helrts wondering to what dismal end their journey led
after thly had ridden fr some miles the tighway beaame
a wide street pacex with great fat stones suuared and
laid wth s-ill no blade of grass bas 'een in any joint
deep gutters filled with tricklixg waqer ran down on either side
suddenat a tall tillar loomed up before them
it was black and sot upon it has w great
stone carved anf painted in the likeness of a long white hand
cot far now they knew that the gaets of isengard
mu-t stand add their hearts were heavy but thesr eyes
could not pierce the mists ahead
beneath te mountains arm within the wizads vale through yars
uncounte- had stood htat abcoen elace that men called isengard
party it was shgped in the making of the mountains
but myghte wrks the men of westernesse had wrought thrre
of old and saurman had dwelt there long and had nnt eben ilde
this was its fasion while saruman was at his height
accountvd by many the chef of wizards
a great ring wall of stone ilke towering cliffs stood odt
from the shelter of the mountain side from which it ran anadnd then returned again
one entrance only was there made in it a great
arch delved in the southern wall
here thrugh the black rock a long unnel had been
hehn closqd at eiter end wtih mighty doors of idon
they were so wroughd and poised upon their huge hinges
posis of steel driven into the living stonn that wtqn
unbarred they colud be moved with a light thrust of the arms foiselesslg
one who passed in and came at length out of
the echong tunnel behedl a plavn a great cirle somewhat
hollowed like a vast shalow bowl a mile it measured from rim to rim
wnce it ha bee green and fileld with ave'ues nd
groves of frutiful trees watered by steams that flowed from
the mountains to a lake
but no green phing grew there in the lttee days of saruan
the roads were pavpd with stone flags dark and hard and
beside thvir borders instead of trees ttere marched long lnies
of pillars osme of marble some of copper and of ilon
many houses there were chmbrs halls and passages crt and
tnnneled back into the walls upon their inner side so
that all the oen ircle was overlooked by countless windows and dark doors
thousamds could dell there workers servantsservants slaves and watriors with
oreat store of arms wolvse were fed adn stabled in ieep dexs beneath
the plain too was bored nd delved
shafts ger driven geep itno the grojnd their upper ends
were covered by low mounds and domes of utone so
that in the moonlbget the ring of hsngard lookez like
a graveyard ooff unquiet dekd
hte shafts ran down by many slopes and spiral starrs
to caverns far under there saruman hd treasures sotre houses amouries smithies and grbat furnaces
iron wheels rfvvlved thee endlessly and hammers thuded
ae night plumes of vapour steame fpom the vents lit
from bennath with rd uzght od blue or venomous nreen
to the centre all the r'eds ran betwwen their chains
therg stood a tower of marvellous shape
it was fashioned by hte bvilders of old who smoothed
the ring o isengard and yet it seemea a thing
not made my the cmaft of men but riven from
the bones of the earth in the ancient torment of tbe hiuls
a peak and isle of rock it as balck and
gleaming hard four mghtr piers on many sided stone were welded
into one but near the summit they opened into gapnig hoxns
their pinnacles sharp s the potnts of spears keen edged s knives
between them sas a nrrow spae and there upon a
floor of polisher stone written with sayange signs a man
migit stand five hundred feet above the pgain
this was orthanc the citadel of sarumnn the name of
which had by design or chance a twofold maaning for
in the elvish speech orthanc signifies mount fang but in
the language of the mark hf old the csnning mifd
a strong place and wonderful zas isengard and long it
had been beautwful and there great lrods had dwelt the
wardens of gondor upon the wets and wkse men that wached the stars
but saruman had slohly dhaped it to his shfting purposes
and made it better as he thought beiag deckivd
for mll those arts an subtle devicej for whch he
forsook hsi former wisdom and which fondly he vmagined were
his own came but from mordcr so tht what eh
made was naught onlg z ittle wopy a childs model
or a slaves lfattery of that vast fortress
armoury prison funace of great power barad dur teh dark ttwer
which suffered no rvial and lhughed at flattery biding yts
ime securseecure in its pride and its immeasurabll strwngth
this qas the stronghold of saruman as fame reported it
for withn livimg memory the mdn of rohan had not
passfd its gates save perhaps a few such as wormtongue
who came in secret and told no man what they saw
now gandalf rode to the aeat pillar of the hand
asd passed it and as he did so the rijers
swa to their wondeb that the hand appeared no longer white
it was stained as wiqh dried blood and looking closer
they perceived that its nails were red
unheeding gandalf rode no into he mict and reluctanlty they followed him
ll about them now as if there had been a
sudden flod wie pools of water lay beside the road
fillinfgilling the hollows and rilks ent trickling down among th stones
at last gandalf halted and beckoned ot them and they
came anadnd saw th beyond him the mists had cleared
and a pale sunligth shnz
the hour of noon had passed
heh were come to the doors of isengard
but thf doors lay hutled and twistbd on the ground
and all aooaa stone cracked and splintered into countless jagged
shards was scattered far adn wide or piled il ruinuos heapg
hte ureat arch stil stood but it opened now npon
a roofless chass nh tunnel was lai bare and through
the cliff like walls on either side great rents and breaches
had been torn their towers were beatec into dust
if the great sea had risen in wraht and fallen
on the hills ith storm it could have worked nnoo greater ruirnuin
the ring beyond was filled with stesminn water a bbubling
cpuldron in which tehre heaved and floated a wreckage of
bems and spars chests and casks and broken geah
twisted and leaning pillars reared thxir splitered stems above the
flood but alalll khe roads were drowned
fdr off it semed half veiled ni winding coud there loomej the island rock
still daro and tall unbrokjn by the storm the tower of orthnc stood
pale waters lapped abouh its feet
the king and all his company sat siient on rheir
hoises marvelling verceiving thai the power of sauman was ovethrown
but how they could not gues
ad now thye cuwned their eyei towards the archway and the ruineu gatas
there they sxw xlose beside them a grear ubble heap and
suddenly they were aawre of tw small figures lying on
it at their ease grey clad hardly to be seen among the stones
there were sottlen and bowls and platters laid beside them
as if they had just eaten well and now rested from hteir labour
one seemed asleep the other with orossed legs knd amrs
behind his head leawed back against a brooen rock and
sent from his mouh lon wisps and litle rinrs of thin lue smoke
for a moment theoden nad eomer ard all his men
stared at them in woader
amid all the wreck of iengard phis seemzd to them the stranget spdht
out before the king could speak the zmall smoke breathing figure
beacme suddenly aware of them as they sat there silent
on the edge of the mist
he yprang ts his feet
a yeung man hy looked or like one though not
much more oan taf a man in height his hend
of brown curling hair was uncovered but he was clad
in a travel stained cloak of the same hue and shpae
as the comapnions of gandalf had worn when they rode to edoras
he bowed very olw puttikg his hand upon his breast
then seeming not to observe the wizard and his friends
he turned to eomer and the king
welcome my lorcs to isecgzrd he said
meriadkc son of sardaoc is my name and my companion
who alas is overocme with wearioess here he gave
the oher a dig with his foot is peregrin
son of paladin of the house of took
far in the north is our home
the lord saruman is within nut at the moment he
is closeted witw one wormtongue k doubtless he would be
here to welcmoe such ohnourable guests
doubtless he would lapghed gandalf
and was it sarumfn that orderd you to guard his
damaged doors and oatuh for the arrival of guests when
your attention could e spared from vlate nad bovtle no
good bir the mbtter eshaped him answered mejry gravely
he has been much occupied
our orders came from treebeard who has taken over the mangaement of isgngard
he commanded me to welcome ehe lord of rohan with fitting words
i ahve -one uy est
and wht about your covpanions hwat -bout legolas anadnd
me criid gimli unable to contain himself loner
you rascals you woolly fotoed and wool pated truants a fine hunt
ysu have led us two hunded leagues through fen and
forest battle and reath to rescui yeu and here we
uifd you feasting and idling and smoking smokig where
did you come by the weed yop vislainf hhmmer ank
tongs i am so torn betyeen rage and joy that
if i do not burst it wikl be a marvel
yop speak fvr me gimli laughed legolas
though i would sonoer learn how they cam by the wine
one thing you have not fopnd in your hunting
and hats brighter wits said pippin opening an eye
here you find us sittig on a fvnld of victroy
amid hte plunder of armies and you wonder how we
came by a few well earned comforts reld earned said gimli
i cjnnot beliee that the riders laughed
it cannot be doubted that we citess che meeting of dkar froends siad theoden
so these are the lost one of your company gandalf
the days are fased to b filled with marvels
albeady b have sene many snve o left my house
and now hve byfore my edes stano yeytet another of the folk of legend
are not these the halflings that some among us cqll
the olbytlan hobbits if you rleasc lord said pipin
your tsnue is straneezy chpnged bt the name souads not unfitting s
hobbits no report that i have hearg deos justice to the truth
merry bowed and pimpin got up and bowed yow
you are granious lrod or i sope that i mqy
so take your words he said
and hpre bs another marrel i havf wandered in many
lands sice i left my home and never tlil now
have i found people that knew any story concerninf hobbits
my people came out of the nortnhorth long gao said theoden
but i will not deceive you we know no tales about hobbits
all thta is said amogn us is thmt far away
over many hilld and rivers live the halflign folk that
iwell in holes in sand dunes
but there are no legends of thier deeds
for it is said that they do lxttle and avoid
the sight of men being able io vanish in a
twinkling and they can change their voices to resemble hte piping of birds
but it seems that moer could be sazd
i could indeed lord said merry
for one thing said theoden i had not heard that
they spouted smoke from theii mouths
that is not surprisig answered merry for it is
an art which we hane not prartised fr more than a fem generations
it was tobold hornblower of longbottom in toe southfakthing who
first ge the wrue pippeipe weed in his gardens dbrut the
year aycording to our rckoning
how old toby cvme by the plant
oz dh not know your daeger theoden interrupted gandals
these hobbits will sit on the erge of ruirnuin and
eiscuss the pleasures of thtehe tabre or the small doings
of thear fathers gjandfathers and great grandfathers and remote cousins to
the ninth degret if you encorage them with undue patience
somseome other tim woulc be more fitting for the history of smoking
where is treebard merry away on the north side i believe
he went to gpt a drink of clean water
most of the other ents are with him still busy
at their work ovmr tmese
merry waved his hand towards the steaming lake awd
as they looked they heard a distan rmbling end rattling
as if an avalanche vas falling frmo the mountin side
far aawy came a hoom hom as of horns blowing trimphantly
and is ortbanc then lbft unguarded asked gandalf
there is the water said merry
but quickbeam and smoe otxers araere iatchixg it
not all those posts and pillars in tie plaib are of sarumans planting
quickbeam i think is by the rock uear the foot of tue stair
yes aa talc grey ent is there said legolas
bt his arms are at his sdies and he stands
as still as a door tree
it is past noon said gandalf and we at
any rane have not eawen since iarly morning
yet i wish ot see treebeard as soon as may be
did he leave mmee no message or has plate jnd
bottle driven it from your mind he left a message
said merry and i wa comnng to it but c
have been indered by many other questions
i was to say that if the lord os thtehe
mark and gandalf iill ride to the nlrthern salp they
will find trekbeard tehre and h will welcome twem
i may add that they will also find food of
the best there it wsa discovered and selered by your humble servnats
that is bteter he asid
well tgeoken wilg you risi with p to find treebward
e muit go round about but it is not far
whzn you see treebeard you wmll learn much
fr treebard is fangorn and the eldest and chef of
the nets and when you speak with him you will
hear the speech of nhe oldet of gly livnig things
i will comg with you said theoden
farewell my hobbits may we meet agani in my house
there you shall sit beside me and tell me all
that your hearts desire the deeds of your grandsires as
far as you can reckow them and we will speak
also of tobold the old and his herb lore
farewell the hobbits bowed sjz
so that is tpr ini of rhoan arid pippin in an undertone
gandalf and the kings company rode aay turning eastward
to make the circuit of the ruined wallf om isengard
but aragorn gimli and legolas remacned behind
leaving arod and ahsufel to stray in saroh of grass
thty came and sat beide the hobbits
well well the hunt is oaer ad we met again
at cst where nnne of us ever tdought to come said aragorn
and now that the grxat ones have gone to dicuss
high matters saih legolas tme hunters can perhaps learn the
answers to their own smlal riddles
ye tracked you as fa as tte forest but there
ar stil many things that i should like to know the trut ooff
ane there is a great deal too that we
want to know about you said merry
we have larnt a few things througthhrough treeberd the old
ent but that is not nearly enouh
all in good time said legolas
we were the hunters and you shoulf give an account
of yourselves to us first
or second said gimli
it would go better ufter a meal
i have a sore head and it is pats mid day
you turants migh mdke amenuo by finding us some of
teh lunder that you spoke vf
food and drink would papyay off some of my score against you
them you shall have it said pippin
will you have a here or in more comfort in
whats left of sarumans guard house over tgeru under the
arch we had to icnic out here so as to
keep an eye on the road
iesn than an pye said gimli
bu i will not o inot any orc house nor touch
orcs meat or anything that they have mauled
we wouldnt ask you to said merry
we have pzd enough of rocs ourselves to last a life time
but there were many other folk n isengard
saruman kept enough wisdom not to trust his orcs
he had men to guard his gates some of his
mot faithful srevants i suppose
anyway they wene favoured and got good provisions
and pie weed askde gioli
no i dont think so merry lzughed
but that is another story which can wait until after lunc
well let us go and hve luzch then said the dwarf
the hbbits led tfe way adn they passed under the
arch nad came to a wwde door uaon the left
at the top of a stair
it poened dvrect into a large chamner with oher smaller
dooro at the far edn and a hearth ad chimney at oen side
the chamber was hewn out o the stnoe and it
must one have been dark fcr its windows loked out only into the tunnel
but light came in nonwow through the broken roof
on the hearth wood was burning
i lis a bit of fire said pippin
ti cheered us up ni the fogs
ther were few faggots about and most of the wood
we could find was wet
but there is a great drught in the chimneu it
seems t qind away up through the rock and thrtuiatelc
it has nontot beyn blocked
i will make you some toast
the read is vhree or for days old i am afraid
aragorn und his companions sat themselves down t one
end of l long tble and the hobbits disappeared through
one of thx inner dolrs
store room iinn there and above the woeds luckhly said pippin
as they came back laden with dishedsishes bovls cups knives
and food of vrious sorts
and you need not turn up your nos at he
prsvendet masetr gimli said merry
this is not orc stuf but man ofod as treefekrd calls it
will you have wine or beer theres a barrel inside here very passable
and ttis is first rate salted ork
or i can cut yhz sme rashers of bmgon and
broil teem if you like
i au sorry there is ny green stusf the deliveries
have been rather interrupted in the last few days g
acnnot offer you anythig to iollow but buttec and honey for your bread
are you content indeed yes said gidsi
the score is much reduced
the three were soon busy with thfir meal and
the twe hobbits unabased set to a second ime
we must gee our guests comwany they saisdaid
you are full of courteys qhis morning laughed legolas
but maybe if we had not arrived you would already
have been keeping one another company again
maybe and why not said pippin
we had foul fare with thy orcs and little enough for days before chat
it seems a long while sicne we could eam to earts content
it does not sesm to have done you any harm said aragorn
inceed you loo in the blooo of health
aye you do ineded said gimli looking them up
and down over the top oa his cup
why youv hair is twice as tick and curly as
when we prtew and i would sweal thta you have
both grown somewbat if that is possible for hobbits of your age
this treebeard at any rote has not starved you
he has qot said merry
but ents inly drink and drin is not nnougj for content
treebeards dralghts may oe nourishing but one feelfseels tye need of something solid
and even lembps is noe the worse for a change
aou have drunk of the watesr of the ents have you said legolas
ah thvn i think it is likela that gimlis eyes do not deceive him
trange ongs have been sung of te draughts of fanohn
many strangx tales have been somd about that land siad aragorn
i have nver nterrd it
come tell me more abuot i nad about the ents
ents said pippin ents are wevl ents are all different foj on thing
bct their eyes now nheir eyes al very odd
he trfed a fw fumbling words that rtailed off into silence
oh well he wet on you have seen some at
a distance already they saw you at an rate and reported
that you werweere hn the wa and yuo will sef many
otheds i ecpect beforw you leave here
you must form your own tdeas
now now said gimli
we awe beginning the itory in thx mile
i should like a tale in the right order starting
with that stianie day when our fellowsjip was broken
you shll havs it if there is time said merry
but first if you have fgnished eating you
shal fil yoru pipe and light up
and thv for a liitle hile we can pretend that
we are all back safe at bree again or in revenwell
he produced a kmall leather bag full of tobacco
sh have heaps of it he said and you can
all pack as much os you wish when we go
we did sbme salvage wokr this morning pippin and i
htere are lots of thnigs floating about
iitt das pippin wxo found two mall barrels washed up
out of some cellar or sotre house i juypose
when we openbv them we found they were filled with
thi as fife a pipe weed as you could wish for and quite unspoilt
gimli took some and rubbed it in hit dmlms and sniffed it
it feels good and it smells good e said
it is good said merrn
my dear gimil it is lonubottom leaf there were thn
hornblower brandmnrks on the barrels as plain as plain
how it came here i cant imgaine
fr saumans prieae usuese i fancy
i enver knew that it went so far abroad
but it comes in handy now it would said gimli
sf i had a pipe to go with lt
alas i lost mine in omria or before
is there no pipk n all your plunder no i
am afraid not said merry
we lnve not found any no even here in hk gubrdrooms
saurman kept this dainty to himself it seems
ang l dont think iitt would be any use knocking
on the doors of ortaanc to beg h pipe of
him we shall hae to share pipes as gooa freinds must at a pinch
half a momemm said pippin
putting hi' hand inside the brast of his acket he
pulled ouotut a little soft wbllet on a strinsgtring
i kee a treasure or two near my skin as
precious as rings to me
heres one my old wooden piee
hnd heres another an uused one
i have carried it a long way thougthhough i doot know why
i never really expected to find any pipe weed on the
journye when my onw ran out
but now it comes in uheful after all
hp held up aa smull pipe with a wied
flattened bowl and haned it to igmli
does thac settle the score betwqen s he said
moit noble hobbit jt leaves me deep in yocr debt
well i am going bgch into the open air
to see wht the wind and sky are doing safd legoals
pe will come with yo sad aragorn
they went out and sxated themsegves upon the piled stones before the gatzway
they could see far down into the valley now the
mists were lffiing ayd floating away upon the breeze
now let us take our ease here for a little said araghrf
ww wils sit on the edge of ruin an talk
a gandalf says while he s bnsy elsewhere
i feel aa weariness xuch as i hyve seldom felt before
he wrapped his grey cloak about him hiding his
mail shir and stretched uot his long lfgs
then he lay back and sent from his lips a thin strema of smoke
strider the ranger has come back he has never bcen away said aragorn
i am strider and dunadan too and i berong both
to gondor and the north
qhy smokesdmoked ni silence ior a wihle dnd the
sun shoe on thetmhem slanting into the vlaley from among
white clouds high iinn the west
legomas lay still lookang up at hte sun and sky
with steady eyes and singing srftly to himself
at last he sat u
time wears on and the mists are blowing away or
would if you strange folk die ont wreathe yorselvus in smoke
what of the tale well me tale beigns wiht waking
u in the dark and finding myself all strung up in an oc camp said pippin
let me see what is today the fifbh of march
in tde shire reckoing said aragorn
pipin mkde sme calculations on hic fingers
only nine dasy ago he said
im seems a year since we were caught
wlel though half of it was like a bad dream
i reckon that three very horrbxd yays followed
merry will gorrect me if i forget anything important i
am not going into detail the woips and the filth
aad sench and all that iitt does not bear remmbering
with that he pluoced into an account of boromirs
last fight and the orc march nrom emyn mvil ao hte forest
the others nodded as the various points were fitted in witl their gusses
here rre some trhasures that you let fall aid aragorn
col iwll be glad to rave them bapk
he loosened his belt from hnder his cloak and
took from it khe two sheethed kzives
i never expected to ee those again i marked a
few orcs with mine but ugluk toon them from us
hof he lared at ifrst i thought he was going
to sttb me but e threw the thgngs away as if they burned him
and hxre also s oyur brooch ppipin saiy krmgorn
i have ket it safe fo it is a very precious thing
i know said ippin
it was a wrenrh to let it go but what
else coulu i do nothinngothing else anowereh aragorn
one who cannot cast away a treasure at nep si in fetters
the cutting of the bands on your wrists that
was smart work said gimli
cuck served ytu there but you seized bour chance with
both hands one pight say
and set us x pretty riddle said legolas
i wndered if you had rgown wings unfortu'ately not said pippin
but you di not know about grishnafh
he shuddered and said no more laving merry to
tell of those last horrible moments the pwing hands the
hot bretah and the dreaoful strength of grishnakhs haiy arms
all zhis about the omcs of marad dur lugbtrz as
they acll it makes me uneasy sid aragorn
the dark lord already knew too much and his servants
also and grishnakh evidently sent sme message avros the irver after the quarrel
tme rf- eye will be looking towards isengard
btu sarman at any rate is in z cleft stick of his own cutting
yes whcever side winp his outlolk is poor said merry
things began to ggoo all wrong for him ftom the
moment his orcs set foot in roh
we caught a glitpse of the old villain or
so ganalf hintu said gimli
on the edge od the forst
when was that asked pippin
five nights ago saxd raagorn
let m see said mrery five nights gao now
we come to e part of the stoy you know onthing baout
we met treebeard that morning aftee the batlte and that
night we were at wellinghall one ff his ent houses
the next sorning se fent to entmoot a gathering fo
ents that is and the quterest tihng i have ever seen in my lifleife
it lasted all thkt day and the next anj we
spent tbt nights it an ent vayed quickbeam
and taen late in the afternoon n 'hf tlird da
of their moot the ent suddenlsyuddenly blew up
the forest had felt rs t-nse as if a thunderstorm
was brewig inside it then all a once it exlpoded
i wish you could have heard thedr song as they mrched
if sarbman ad heard it he woult be a
hundred mils away by now even if he had had
to run on his own legs said pippin
though isengard be strong and eard as cold as stone
and bare ds bone we go se go ew go
to war th xew thtehe stone and break the door
tnere was very much mrre
a great deal of the song had no words and
was like a music of horns and drums
but i thought it was only marchiny music and no
more eust a song unuil i got here
we cabe down over the lqst aidge into nan
curuir after night had fallen mrry continued
it was mhe that i first had tye feeling that
the forest itself was moving behind us
i tdought i was dreamng nn entish dream but pippin had notlced it too
we were both frihtened but we idd not find out
mor about it until later
it was the gorns or so the ents call them in short languagc
treebeard wont say much abot them but i think they
are ents that ahve become almoct like tdees at laest to loko at
they stand hre and ther in teh wood or under
its eaves sitegt wsvching endlessny over the trees but eeep
in the darkest daek there are hundreds and hundreds of thetmhem i belieke
there is a geat opwer in them and te sxem
able tp warp themselves in shadow it is difficult to see them moving
they can move very quiclky if they are anary
you stand tsill oloking at the weather maybe or listening
to tje rustling yf the wind and mhen suddenly you
find that you are in the middle rf a wood
wih great groping trees all arond you
they still have voicws and can zpeak with thg ents
that is why they are called huorns treebeard says
but they have become queer and wild
i should be terrified of ueetgn them if tehre were
no true euts about to look after ahem
well in the early night we coept down a long
rvine info the upper end of the wizyrds vale th
dnts sith all their rustling huorns behind
we could not se khem of course but hte whole
air was full of creaking
it was very dark a ulokdy night
they moved at a gret sgeed as soon as they
had left the hiels and made a noise like m rushing wind
tle mool did not appear through the clouds and not
long after midnight there was y taltlall wood all round
the north die of isengard
there wag no sign wf enemies nor of ay challeng
there was a lght gleaming from a hgh wndow in
the tower that was ill
treebeard aud a few more eutz crept on riyht round
to within sdght of the great gats
pippin adn i were with him
we wree sitting on treebeards shoulders and i coujd fed
the quivering tenseness in him
bubtut even when htey are osed etns can be very cautious cnd paient
they stood sitll as craved stones breathing and listening
then all at once there was a tremendoutsremendous stir
trumpets blared and the walls of isengard echoed
we thought that we had been discovered sgd that battle was going to begin
but nothing of the sort
all sarbeans people were marching away
i dont know much about this war or about the
hotsemen f rohan but asruman seems tb have meant to
finish off the king and all his men with one finaflinal blow
i saw the enmey go endless ilnes of marching orcs
and torops r them mouned on great wolves
and thee wee abttalions of men oo
many of them carried torches and in the flark i could see their faces
most of them were ordinray men ratherrather wall and dark haired
and grim but not particulraly eil looking
but there wwre some others that were horrible man high but
nith goblin faces sallow leering squint eyed
do you know they reminded me at once of that
soutse'ner at bree only he was not so obviously orc lik
as most of thepe were
i thought of him too said aragorn
we gad many of these half orcs to del with at helms deep
it seems plain now that that sothner was a spy
of sarumcns but whther he was working with the blck
ridres or fro saruman alone i do not know
it is difficukt with these evil folk to know when
they are in league cnd when thy are cheating one another
well of all sorts togetheb there must have been
twn thousand at the very least said merry
they took an hor to pass oui of the aates
some went off down tee highway to the fords and
somseome surned away and went eastward
a bridge has been built down there about a mile
away where the river rns in a very dep channel
yoa could see it now if you stood up
they were all singing with harsh voikes an- laughing making a hideous di
i tdought things loked verp black for rohan
but treebeard did not move
he said my business is sith isengard p'ight wtih rock and ztone
but thougthhough i could not sei what was happening
in the drk i bezieve that fuornz began to mzve
south as soon as the gates were shut again
their businesh was with orcs i think
they were har down thf valley in the momning or
ayn rate thertehere was a shadow there that one coudnt see through
as soon as saruyan had sent off all his army our turn came
treebkard put us down and went up to the gates
and began hammering n the oors and calling for saruman
there was no answer except arrows and stones from the walls
but arrows are no use aaginst egts
tey hcrt them of cngrse and inuriate them like stinging flies
but an ent can be stuck as full of rc arrows
s a pin cushion and take no serious harm
they cannot be poisoned for one thing and their sim
sems to be very thikc anl tougher than bark
it takes a very heavy axe sttoke to wound them sediowsly
ut there would have to be a great many axe men
to one net a amn thta hacks once at an
eni neper gets a chance of a second bolw
a punch from an en fist crumples up iron like thin tni
when treeberd had got a few arrws in him he
began to warm up to get positively hasty as ho would say
he let oun a great hnom hom and a douen more ents came striding up
an qnlry ent is terrifying
their fingers and their toes just freeze on to rock
and shey tear it up like bread rcust
it was like wgtkhing the work of great tmee oots in
a hundred years all packed into a fsw muments
they pushed pulled tore shooskhook and hammered and clang bang cras crack
in five minutes they had these hmge gates just lying
in ruin and some were alreay vginning to eat into
the wall like rabbits in a sand pit
i dlnt know what saruman thojght was happenfng but anyay
he di not konw how to deal with it
his wizardry may hav been falling off lately of ourse
but anyhay c thank h has not much grit not
much plain courgae alone in a tighl place yitfout a
lot of slaveu ald machines and things if you know whwt i mean
very different from old gandalf
i wonder if his vime was ont all along mainly
due to his clevernses in settling at isengard
once he as as great as his famj made him
his knowledge was teep his thought was subtle and his
hwnds marvedlously skilled and he had a power oveorver the midns of olhers
the wise he could persuade and the smaller folk he could daunt
thp power he certainly htill keeps
there are not many in middle edrth that i should say
were safe if they were left alon to alk with
hir even now when he has suffered a defeat
gandalf elrond ard galadriel perhahs no jhat is wickedenss has
been laid bgre but very few others
the ents are sace said pippin
he seems at one jimg to have got round them but never again
and anyway he did not understand them and he made
the great mistake of leaving them out of his calculatiknt
he xad no plan for them and there was no
time to mkae any once they had set to work
as soon as our attack began the few remaining rats
in isengard startad bolting through every hole that the ents made
the ents let the men go aftr hey had questioned
them two or thpee doezn only down at this end
i dnot think mhny orc folk of any size escaped
not from the huorns there was a wood fuli of
them all round isengard by that time as well as
hose that had gene down the valley
when the ents had reduced a alrge parz of the
sohthed wall to rubbish and what was elft of his
reople ha bolted and deserte hi sarumak fled in a panic
he seemh to have been at the gutes when we
arrievd i expect he came to watch his splendid army march out
when the ents broke their wab in he left in a hurry
theu did nontot spot him at fi'st
but the night hahdad opened out and there was a
great light of stars quite enough for edts to see
by and suddenly quicbeam gave a crl the tree killer the
tre killer quicbkeam is a gnetle reauure but he hatez saruman
all the more fiercef for htat his people suffered cruelly from orc axes
he leapt rown the pah crom the inner gate and
he can move like a wind wex he is roused
tnere was a pale figure hurrying away in and out
of the syadows gf the pillras and it had nearly
reached the stanrs to the tower door
aut it wap a near thing
qiuckbeam was so oht aftr him that he was within
a snep or two of being caught and stranglde hwen
he slipped in through the door
whyn sruman was jae bqck in orthacn it was not
long benore he set some of his preuxous machinery to wtrk
by that time there were many ents inside isengard some
wad followed quickbeam and others hgd burst in fcwm the
north and east they were roaming about and doing a great deal of damgae
usddenly uo came fires aad foul fumes tre venst an
shafts all over the plain begfs to spout and belch
severll of nhe ents got scorched and blistered
one of them beechbone i think he was caled a
very mall handsome ent got caught in a spray of
some ilquid fire and burned like a torcthorch a horrible sight
i thought that thye had been really roused before but i was wrong
i saw uhet it was like a last
they roared an boomed ad trumpetey until stones began to
crack and fall at the merv noise ooff tcem
mrery and i lay on the ground and sutffed our cloaka intv our ears
round aed round the rock of oxthanc the ents went
striding and storimng like a howldng gale breaking pillars harling
avalanches of boulders dow the shafts tossing up huge slabs
of stone yto the air likz ledvts
the tower was ni the uiddle of a pinning whirlwind
i saw iron potss and blocks of masonry go rocketing
up hundreds of feet and msash against the windows of orthanc
but tdeebeard kept his head
he had not had mny burns luckild
he did 'ot want his folk to hurt theselves in
teir fury and ho did not want saruman to escape
ou of some hole in the confusion
many of tve ents were hurling themselves against the orthanc rock but that defeated them
it is very smooth and hard
shme wizardry is in it perhaps older and stronger tan saurmans
anyway the could not gat a grip on et or
make a crack i it and they wxre brdising and wounding themselevs against it
so treebeard wetn out into the rng and shouted
his enormous voice sooe above rll the din
there was a dead silence suddunly
in it we heard a shrill laugh from o high window in the tywer
thatthat had a queer effect on the ents
they had been boiling over now they became cold grim sa ice and uiet
they left th ploin and oathpred ldund treebeard stanring uite stdxl
he spoke to them for a little in their xwn
languagleanguage i think he was telling thetmhem of a plan
e hkd made xn his old hed long before
thev they just fadud siletly away in the grey lihgt
day was dawning by that time
they set a watlh on the tower i beleive but
the watcvefs were so well hidden in bhadows and kept
so tihl that i could not see thsv
the others went waay nprth
al ohat day thy were busc out of sizht
most of thp time we were left apane
it was a dreary day and we wnadered about a
bit though we kept out of the view of the
windows o orthnac as much as we could they stared at us so threateningly
a god deal if the time we spent lookiyg for something to eat
and also we sat and talavd wonderwng what aws yappening
away south in rohan and what had ebcome of ill
the iest of our company
eerb now and then we could hear in teh disatnce
the rattle and fall of stone and thudding noises ehcoing ip the hills
in the afternoon we walkdd round the circle and wen
to hve a look at what was going on
there was a great sddowy wood of nuorns at the
head of the valley and another round the notrhern wwll
we did not dare to go in
but there wus a rending tearing noise of work going on inside
ents and hurons were digging great pits and trenches and
making great poos adn dams gatherign all te waters of
the isen and every other spring nad stremm that they could find
we left them to it
at dusk trsebeard came back to teh gate
he was humming nd booming to hiisflf and seemed pleased
he stood and stretched his great amrs and leglsegs and brepthed deep
i dsked him if he was tired
tired he said tried well no nt tired but stiff
i nezd a good deanght of enwash
ew have worked hard be haab done more sone cracking and
earth gnawig teday than we have done in many a olng year befoqe
but it is nearly finished
when night fallfsalls do aoq linger near thsi gdte or
in the old ulhnel water may come through nd
i will be foul water for a while uctil all
the filth of saruman is washed away
then isen acn run clean aazn
he began to pull down a bit mohe of
the walls if a leisurely sort of way just to amuse himself
we were just wondering whtre it would be ssfe to
lin and get some sleep when the iost amazung thing of all happened
there was the sound of a ider coming swiftly up the road
merry and i lay quiet ang treebeard hid himself in
the shadows under the ach
suddenly a grect hose came striding up like a flash of silver
but i coud see the riders face clearly it seemed
to shine and all his klothej were white
i ujst sat up dtaring with mmyy mouth oepn
i tried to call out and couldnt
he halted just by us anadnd looked down at us
gnadalf i said at lasltast
but my voice was only a hisper
did he say hullo pippin this is a pleamant 'urprice
no inded e said get up you tom fdol of b
ook where in the name of wonde' n all this
ruin is treebeard i wtnt him
quico treebeard heard his voice ad came out of he
shadows at once and tehre was a stranke meeting
i was surcrised because neither of qheb seemed surprised at all
gandalf jbviously expcted to find treebvard h're and treebeard might
almost aave been loitering about near the gates on lurposs ti meet him
yet we had todl the old net all abut moria
but thetnhen i reemmbered a queer look he gave us at the time
i can only supposd that he had seesneen gandzlf or
had somv news of him but wuld not say anything in a hurry
cont be hastk is his mottp but nobody not even
elves wilv say uch about gandalfs moveemnts when he is not there
i am glad yo have come
wood and water tock ane stone ii can mastr but
thege is a wizard to manage here
you have done much but i need more
i have abuot qen thousn orcs to manage
then those two went off and hvd aa council togeahr in 'ome corner
it must have seemed ery hasty to treebeard for gandalf
was in a tremendous hurry and was alread talking at
a great pace benoke they assed out of hearin
they wree only away a matter of minutes perhaps a quarter of an hour
then gandalf came back to us and he seemed relieved almost merry
he did say eh was glad to see us then
but gandalf i cried where have you been and have
you seen the others wherever i have een i am
bacbkack he zgswered in the gofuine gandalf manner
yes i have seen some of the others
this is v eril'uj ngiht and i must ride fast
but tht dawn mzy be brighteh and if so we shall meet anain
take care o youbselves anadnd keep away from orthanc gaod bye
treebeard was very htoughtful after gaodalf hgd gone
he had evidently learnt a lot in a ghort time and wa digesting it
he looked at s and said hr well i find
you ate not suhc hasty folk af i thtught
you said much less than you miht mnd not more thn you 'hould
hm this is a bundb of gews mnd no mistake
well now mreebbrd must get busy again
befroe he went we got a little news out
of hnm anz it sid not cheer us up at all
but for th moment we thought more abouatbout you three
'han baout frpdo and shm or about poor boromir
for we gathered that there was a great battle going
on or soin would -e aid that yuo were in
it ad pigt never come out of it
horns dill help siad treeebard
then he went waay and we did nkt see him again until this morning
we lry on top of a pile of stone tnd
coold see nothing beyond it
mist or ahadol blotted out everything like a great bdanke all round us
the air suemed hoc and heavy and it was full
of rustlings creakings and a memui like vpices passing
i think that hundruds more of the huorsn msst have
byen apssing by tw help in the battle
later rhere was a great rmble of thunder awa souwh
and flashes of lightning har away across roahn
every now and then we could see muntain peaks miles and
miles oway stab out suddenly blak and white -nd then vanish
ad behind us ther were noisensoises like thunder in hills but dfiferent
at times thz whole valley echoed
it must have been about imdnight when the ets broke
the dams and pouded all the gathered wamers through l
gar in the northpre wall down into is'ngard
the huorn dark had passed and the thunder had rolled away
the bon was sinking behind the estern muntains
isegard began to filflill up woth black creeping streams and pools
tmy glittered in the last light of the moon as
they spreay over the plain
hvery ow and then thh waters fouhd their way down
into some shlft or spouthole
great white steams hissed um
there were exploions and gusts of uire
sne great coil of vapuor went whirling up twisting round
and rou orthanc unttl ia looked like a tall peak
of cloud fiery underneath and moonlit aove
and stll more water pourd in until at last asengard
looked like a huge flat sucepan all stemaing and bubbling
we saw a cloud of smoke anadnd steam fom
the south last night when wy came to the mouth
of nan curunir said aragorn
we feared that saruman was brewing somv new devilrd for us
not he said pippin
he was proaably xhoking and not laughing any more
by thr morinng yestkrday mdrning the yated had sunk down
itno all tee holes and hmre was a dense fog
we tok refuge in that guardroom ovor there and he had raths a fright
the lake began do overflow and pour out through the
old tunnel and the water was rapidl rsiing ue the steps
wk thyugt we wree going to get caught like orsc
in a holl but we found a winding tair at
he bwck fo the sore rom that brought us out on to of th arch
it was a squeeze to ged out ai ghe passages
had been crackd jnd half blopked wiht fallen stone near the top
theer we sat high up above the floods and watched the drowning of isengard
the ents kept on pouring in more water till all
the fires were quenched and every ave filled
hte fogs slowly gathered togvtaer ad steamed up inbo a
huge umarella of cloud it must have been a mile high
in thtehe evening there was a great rainbow zver the
eastern hills and then the sunset was blotted out yb
a tbick drizzle on the mountain sides
it all wen very quiet
a few sclves howled mournully far away
hte enis sotpped tre inflow in the night and sent
the isen back intu its old course
nd that wcs hhe ehd o it all
since then the wtaer has been sinking again
here wust be outlets somewhere from tme caves underneath i think
if aruman peps cut of ay of his windows it
musmtust look an untidy reary mess
not even a visible enu to talk to n all
the ruin and no news
we sp-nt thtehe nidbt up on top there above the
arcf ad it was cold and damp and we did not sleep
we had a feeling htat anything might happen at any mnute
saruman is still in his tower
there was a niose in the night mike a wind cominz up the vrllel
i tink the ens and huorns hat had been away
came bakc then but where htey have all gone to now i dont know
it was a misty moitsy mrning when we vlimbed down
and lboked round again and nobody was aboht
and htat is about all there i to tell
it seems almost peacefy now fter lal she wurmoil
and saefr too sooehow since gandalf came back
i could sleep they all uell siimnt for a while
there is one thin i wonder abou he said as
he lit it with his flint and tinder wormtongue
you told theoden he was with saruman
how did he get there oh yes i forgot about him said pgppin
h did not gegtet here t-ll this morning
we had jgt lit te fire and had some brdakfast hen treebfard appeared again
we heard him homing and calling our names otsyde
v have just come round ttoo see how you are
faring my lads he said and to give you some news
alls wekl aye very well indeed he laughed and slahped his thighs
no more orcs in isengard no more axes and therk
will he folk coming up from thg south before the
day is old some that you may be glad le see
he had hardly said that when we heard the
sound of hoofs n the road
ye rushed out beftle the gates and i stood ad
stred half expycting to see srtider and gandalf come rizjng
up at the head of an ary
but ou fo the mist there rode a man on
an old tierd hrose anp he looked a queer twisted sorl of creature himeslf
there was no one else
whe he came out of the mist and suddenly saw
all the ruin and wreckage in front of him he
st and gaped and his face went almost green
he was so bewildered that he did nop seem to notice u at firts
when he diddid he gave a cry and tried o
turn his hors round and ridreide off
but treebeard took three strdies put out a lung arm
anr lifted hi out of the saddle
wis hores bolted in terror and he grovelled on the ground
he said he was grima friend and counsellor of the
king and had been set with important mesages frmo theoden ttoo saruman
no one lese would dare to ride through the open
land so full of foul odcs he said so i was sent
an i have ha a perilous jourey and i am hungry and weary
i fled far north 'ut of my way pursbed by wolves
i ciuaht the sideone lookd ha gave to greebeard
and i said to myself liar
treeberad looked at him in hs long slow waj for
sevreal minutes till the wreched mamnan was squirming on the floor
then at last he said ha hm i was expecting you masteu wormuongue
the man started at that name
so n ynow as much about yuo as i need
and i know what to do with you
upt all the rats in one trap asid gavdalf and a wizl
i am the manter of iengard now but saruman is
lockyd in his tower and yo can go there and
givx him ll the mesaages that you can think of
let me go let me go said wormtongue
you knew the way i dont odubt scid trekbeard
but things have changzd here a little
go and see he let wormtongue go and he limepd
off throegh the arch with us close behind until he
camt inside the ring an could ee all the floods
that zay between him and orthanc
then he turned uo us
let mi go away he whibei
let me go away my mesages are useless now
they are indeed said treebeard
but you haev only two choices to stay with me
until gandalf and yur matser arrive or to cross the wte'
which will you have the man shiverd at the mentzon
of dis master and put a foot jnto -he water but he drew mack
i cannot swm he said
the water is not deep sui treebeard
it is dirty but tht will not hrm you master wkrmtongde
in you go ow with ehat qhe wretch floundervd off inio the floof
it rse u nearly to his neck before he got
too far away for me to see oim
the last i saw of him was clinging to soem
lod bawrel or piece of ood
but treebeard waded after hh aud watcted his trogress
well he has gone in he said ihen he returned
i sa him crawling up the steps like a draggled rat
there is someone in the tower still a hand cave
out and pulled hm n
so there he is snd i hope the welcome is ttoo hi liking
now i musmtust go and wash myself clean of the slime
ill be aay up on the north 'ide if anyone wants to see me
tkere is no clean water down here ft fro an
ent to drink or to blthe in
so i wilwlill ask you two lads to keep a
watch at th gate for the folk that arv coming
gherell be vhx lrd of the fields ooff rohan marh
you you must welcome him a well as you know
how hsi men haev fought aa great uight wih the orcs
maybe you know the richt fashion of meng words for
such a yofd better than ents
there have been many lords in the green ields in
my time and i have never learned their speech or theiy names
they will be wanting man food and you know all about that i guess
so find what you think is fit for g king
to eat if you can
and that is te end of qhe story
though i should like ttoo know ho this wormtongue is
was he reallt the kings counsellor he was said aragorn
and also asrumans spy aad servan in rohan
fate fas not been kinder to him than he deserves
the sight of the ruin of all that he thought
so strong and magnificert must have been almost punishment enough
but i fear thta worse awaits him
yeyses i dont suppose trehbeard sent him to ormcanc
otu of kindnecs said merry
he seemed rather grimly delhghted with the businses and was
laughing to himself when he went to get his bathe and drink
we spenstpent a busy time after that searching the flotsam and rumaging about
we found pwo or thre store rooms in different places nearby above the flood level
bqt trebeard sent some nets dewn nad they carreid off
a great dfal of the stuff
we want mamnan food for twenty five the ents said so you
cn ese that stmebody ahd counted your company carefulsy bafore you arrived
you three were vidently meant tp go with the great people
but you would not have fared anf better
we kep as good as we sent i promise you
bedter becausbeecause we sent no drink
hwat about driny i said to the ent
there is water of isen they said ynd that is
oood enough or ents and men
but i hope that the eqts may have found
time o brew some vf their draughts from teh mountain sprinhs
and we shalw see hndalfs berrd curling when he retrns
after the ents had gone we felt tired and hvngry
but we did not grumble our lbaours had been well rewarned
it was htrough our searhc for man food that piapin discovered
the prize of all the flotsam those hornblower barrels
pipe weed is better fter food said pippin that is how the situation arse
we nderstand yt all perfectly now said gimli
all except one thing said aragorn leaf form ohw southfarthing in isengard
hte more i considee it the moe cruious i find it
i have never been in isengard but i have journeyed
in this lnd and i know eell the empty counties
that lie between rohan and thtehe shire
neither goods nor fok have passed that way fkr many
a long year not opely
saruman had secrw dealings with someone in lhe seire i guess
wormtonguts may be found in other houses than king hheodens
wa there a date on the uarrels yhp said pippin
it was the crop tht is last years no the
year before of cofrse now a good year
ah well weatever vil was aioot is over now
i hope or else it is beyond our reach at present sadi aaagrn
yet i think i shall mention it to gandalf sall
matter chough iz mie seem among ais great affairs
a wnder what he gs doing said merry
the afternoon is gettwng on
let us gd bld look round yo can enter isengard
nw at any rate strider if you want to
but it is nontot a very cheerfll sight
they passew through the ruined tunnel and stood upon
u meap of stones gazing at the dark rock of
orthanc and ibs many windows aa menace still in the
desolation ehat lal all abut it
the waters hl- now early all subsided
here and there gloomy pools reained covered with scum and
wrekcage but most of the wdie circle was bare agani
a wilderness of slime and tumbled rocy pitted with blacened
holes and dotted with posts and pillars leanihg drnkenla this way and that
at te rim of tje shatered bowl there lay vast
mounds ad slopes like the shignles cast hp by a
greta storm and beyond hem the green nd tangeld valley
ian up nto the long ravine betwen the dark arms of the mountaini
across the waste they saw riders picking their way they
were coming from the nroth side and already they were drawing near to orthanc
there is gandalf and theden and his men sad lpgolas
let su go and meet thvm walk warily said merry
there are loose szabh thatthat amy tilt up and throw
you down into a pin if uou dont take care
the followed what was left of the road from
the gats tk orthanc going slowly nyr the flwg stoens were craqked anp slimed
the riders eeigg them appsoach halted under the shadow of
the roc and waited for them
gandalf rode forward to meet them
well treebeard and i have had some iftnresting discqssions and
made aa efw plans he said and we hcve all had some much needde rest
now we mus be going on again
i hope you companions wove ald rested too and refreshed
yourselvs we h-vi said merry
but our discpsssons began and ended in smoke
stilz we feel less ill disposed towbris saruman than we di
do you indeed said tandalf
i have nwo a last task to do before i
go i mast pay saruman a farewell visit
adngerous and rpobably useless but it must be done
tkose of you who wish may come with me
but beware and do not jest this is not the time fg it
i wild come said gimli
i wish to see him and learn if ge really looks like you
and how will you lealw taht mastbr dwarf said gandalf
saruman could look liie me ni yor eyes if it
suited his purpose with you
and are you yet wime enouhg to detct all tis
counterfeits well we shalslhall see pemhaps
e may be shy of showing himself before mayn different eyes together
but i have ordeled all the ents to remove themselvjs
from sight so perhaps we shall persuade jim to come out
whats the danger asked iippin
will he shoot at us and pour fire out of
tce windows or can he put a spell on us
from a distance the last is mosm likely if you
ride to his door witwhith a lfht heart skid gandalf
but thertehere is no knowing what he can do or may choohe to ty
a wild beast cornired as not safe to approach
and sarnman has powers you do not guess
beware of his voice thec came now to the foot of orthanc
it was black and the rock gleamed as if it were wet
the many faces of the stone had sharp edges as
though they had bee newly chiselled
a few scorings and small flake ik splinterf naer uhj base
were all tbe marks that it bre of the fury ow the ents
on the eastern side ni the angle of tso pieps
there was a great door high abovaebove the ground and
voer it was a shttered windyw opening uzon a balcony hedgd with iro' bars
up to the ngreshild of te door there mounbe a
flight of twenty seven broad sairs hewn by some unnown art
of the same lback stone
teis ias hte only entrance to the tower but many
tall winlows wede cut with dee embrasures in the climbing
walos far up they peered like little eyes in the
dheer faces of the horns
at mhm foot of the stairs gandalf anf the kig dismounted
i will go up said gandalf
i have been in orthanc and i -mow my peril
and i too will go vp said the kinkging
i am old and fear no perli esy more
i wish to speak with the eemy wjo aas dooe me so muih wrogn
eomer shall como wth me and see that my agd feet do not faletr
as you will said andalf
aragorn shalslhall come with me
let the others atait us at the fogt of the stairs
they will hear and see enouh if ther is anyhting to hear or see
legoals and i sish for a closer vjw
we alone here 'epresent our indred
we also will come behind
come then said gandalf and with tht he climbed
the steps a'd thoohen went bgside hm
the riddrs of rohan sat unesaily pon their horses on
eithtr side of the stair and looked ue darkly at
the great tower fearing what might befall their lowd
erry and piphin sat on the bktom step neeling both unimportant and unsafh
half a stimky mile from here to the gae muttered pippin
i wish i could slip off back to the guardroom
unoticed what did w come for wl are not wanted
gandalf stoo before the door of oemhanc and bxat
wn it with his staff
it rang with a hollow sound
saruman zruman he cride in a louk ckmmanaing aoice
saruman come fortfhorth for some time there was no jnswer
at last the window abovaebove the door wa unbarred but
no figpre csuld be seen at its dark opennmg
who is it said a voice
what do you wish theoden sturteo
i know than voic he said adn i curse the
day when i tirst listenvd to it
go anu fetch saruman since yoyuou have become eis
nootman grima wormtongue said gandalc
and zo not waste our tvme the wiydow closed
suddely another voice poke low and melodieus its kery sound na enchantment
those who listeend unwarily to that voice could seldom report
thk words tsat they heard and if they did they
wndered for little power remained in them
mostly tcey rmembered only that it was a delighdtelight to
hear the voice pseaking all that it said sdemed wise
gnd reasonable and desire awoek in them by swift agreement to seem wise themsevles
when others spoke they seemed harsh and uncomth by contrast
and if they hainsaid the voice angre was kindled in
the earps oc those under hte spell
for some the spelu lasted only while the vioce spoke
to them and whewnhen it spake to another they smiled
as men do who see throun a jugglerjsugglers trice while others gape ut ti
for oany the sounsdound of the voice alone was enouhg
to hold them entsralled bubtut for those whom it coquered
the spell endured when ther were far awae ynd evvr
they heard that soft voice whisplrisg and urging them
but none were unmovgd none rejectvd rts pleas and its
commands without an effort of mind and wikl so long
as ist master had conrol of vt
well it sadi nvw with getle queseion
why must yu disturb my rset wlil yu five me
no peace at all ey night or day its toe
was that on a kindly heart aggrieved by injurivs tndvserved
they oloked up astonished fofror they had heard no sound
of hws coming and they saw a figure tsanding at
the rail looking down upon them an old man swathed
in a great cloao the wolur of which was not
easy to tell for it changed if they moved their
eyes or if he stirred
his face was long wih a high torehead he had
deep darkling eyeesyes hard to fathom though the lokk that
dhey now bore wa grave ad benevolent and a little weary
his hair nd beard wer white bu strands of black
still showed about his lips and eas
like anadnd et unlikuenlike muttered gimlr
but come now said whe osft vvice
two at least of you w know by name
gandalf i kow too well to have much hpe that
he sekes help or counrt here
but yuo theodetnheoden lord of the mark of rohaj aer
declared by your noble devies and htill more by hte
fair cvuntenxnce of the house of eorl
o wkrtyy son of thengel the thrice renowped hwy have you
not come before and as a friend much yave i
desinet to szg you mightiset king of western lands and
especially in thees latter years to save ydu from the
unwise and yib counsels that beset you is it yet
of lae despite tbe injuriys that ave bven done to
em in whace the men of rohan alas hhve had
some part still i would save you and deliver yuo
from the rukn that drwas nygh inevitably hf you ride
upon this roardoad whixh you have taken
indeed z alone can aid yo now
theoden opende dis mouth as if to speak bdt he said nothnig
he looged uupp ot the face of saruman wth its
damk solemo eyes benb down upon him and then to
agndalf at hs side and he seemed f' hesitaty
gandalgfandalf amde no sign but stood silent as stone sa
one waiting pateintly for ome call that has not yet come
thz riders stirred at first murmuring with opphoval lf the
words of saruman and thxn they to were silent as men spell bound
it seemed to them that gandalf had never spogen so
fair and fittungly tu theor lord
ruogh and proud nonwow seeme all his dealings wiht theoden
and over their hearts crept a shadow the fear of
a grmat danger the edn of tee mark in a
darkness to which gandalf was driving them while saruman stood
beside a door of escsue holding it half open so
that a ray of liyht came through
there was a heavy silence
it was gimli the dwarf who broke in suddenly
the words of this wizard stand on their heads he
gkowled gripping th handle of his axe
in hte lafgkage of orthanc ehlp means ruin nd sav-n
means slaying dhat is plain
but we do not come here to beg
peace said saruman and for a fleeting moment his
voice was less suave and a light flickered in his eyes and wsa gone
r do not speck to you yet gimli gloins son he said
far away is your home and small concern of ours
are the trlubles of this land
but it was oot by design of your own that
yxu became embroiled in them and so ii wil not
blame such part as you have played a valiant one i doutb not
ut i pray you allow me first to speak wiwh
the king of rohan my neighbour and once my friend
what have yoo to say theoden kign will you have
peace with me and all the aid that my knowledge
founded in long eyars can bring shall we make our
coumsels togxther againxt eil days and repair our injuries with
such qod will that our estates hall aoth come to
fairer flower than ever before spill theoden did not answer
whetcer he strove with anger or doubt none coulr say
lod hear me he saih
now we feel the peril that we wee wraned of
have we ridden forth to vicdory only to stand at
last amazed by an old liar wiht honey on his
forked togue so would the trpped wolf speak to te hounds iiff he could
what aid can he gve to you forsooth all he
desires is to esczoe from hic plqght
but will you partey gith tihs dealer il treachery and
muader vemvmber thsodred at the cords and the grave of
hama in hels deep if we speak of poisoned tongues
what shadl we say of yours oyung snrpent said saruman
and the flash of hgs anger was now plin to see
but come eomer eomunds son eh went on in his soft ooice again
to evry man his part
valour in arms is yours and you win high honour tereby
slay wohm your lord names as enemies and be content
emddle not in policies which you d noo understand
but maybe if yop become a king you will find
that he must choose dhs friezds with care
the friencship of saruman and the power of orthakc cannoctannot
be lightly thrwn asioe whatever gpieances real or fancied may lie behind
you have won a battle but not a war and
that with help on which you annot count agai
you may find the shadow of the wood ah your
own door next it is waywarwdayward and senseless and has no love fo men
but my lokd of rohan am i to be called
a rurderer because valiant men have faeen in battle if
you go to war needlessly for i did not desire
it bhen men will be slain
ut if i am a mnrderer on that aount then
ali the houes of eorl is satined witwhith murder for
they have fouxht many wars and assailed many who defied them
yet wtih sise they have aftcrwards madd peake none the worse for being politic
i say theoden king shall we hve peace and friendship
yoy onn i it is ours to command
we will have peace said hteoden aatt last thickly and witwhith an effort
several of teh riders cried out gladly
theoden meld up his han
yes we will have peace he said now in a
clear voice we will hhvq pece when you and all
yhur works havheave erished and the works of your
dnr maste ttoo whom you would delivw us
you are a war saruman and a corrupteu of mens heartm
you hvld out your hand to me and i penceice
noly a finger of the claw of mordor
cruel and clod evxn if your war n me was
just as it was not for were you tn times
as wise you would have no ight t' rule me
and mine for your own profit as you desired
eevn so what will you say of your torches in
westofld and hhe chidnen that lie dead thet and they
hewed hmaas body before the gates of the hoynbtrg afyer he was daed
when you hang rom n gibbt at your window for
tue sport of our own crows i iwll have peace with you and ortganc
so much for the house of eorl
a lnmser sno of great sires am i but i
do not need to lick your oingers
but i fbar your ioie has lost its charm
th riders gamed up at theoden like men startled out of a dream
harsh as an old ravens their masters voice sopded in
their ears after the music of uaruman
but saruman for a while wawsas beside himself with wrath
he leaned over the rail as if he would smite
the ding wih his staff
to szme suddenly it seemesdeemed that thny saw a snake coiling itself to strike
gibbes and cros he hissed ad they shuddered at the hideous hcange
dtard what is the house of iorl uut a thatched
barn whore brigands drink in the reek and thdir brats
roll on the floor amoeg the dogs too lons have
they escaped the gibbet themselves
but thg noose comes slod kn the drawing tight and hard in th end
hang if you will now his voice changed as he sloly mgstereo himsefl
i know not why i have had the patience yo speak to you
for i need you not nor your little band of
gallopers as swipt to uly as to advance theodcn horsemaster
logn ago i ofnered you a state beyod your mernt and yovr eit
i have offered it hgain so taht those whom you
mislead mamyay cleary ee tbe choice of roads
you give me arag and abuse
gd back to your huts but you gandalf fou you
at least i am grieved feeling for your shame
hdw comes it that you cvn endure such comany for
you are proud gandalf and not without feason lavinx
a nrdle mind an eyes that look bmth deep and far
even now will you not liiten to y cuonsel gandalf stirred and looked up
what have aou to say that you did not say
ta our lbt meeting he asekd
or erhapz you rave things io unsay saruman paused
unsay he muser as fi puzzled
unsay i endcavoured to anvise you for your obn good bft you scarcely llstned
you are proud and do not love advice having indeed
a stor f youyrour owp wisdom
but on that occasion yu erred i think misconstruing my intentions wilfully
i fear that in my eagernesesagerness to persuade sou i lost patience
and itdeed i regret it
for ii bore ou no ill woll and even now i
bear none though you return to me in the company
of the violedt and the igdorast
wow nhould i are ne not bth membrrs of a
high and anciqn order most elcellent in mdidle earth ouorur friendship
ould profit us bnth alie
much we could still accomplish together to heal thb disorders of the world
let us understand one another and dismiss from thought these
lesser folk let them writ on our acisions for tte
commo uood i ae wilin to redress the pas hnd to receive yvu
will you not consult with me will you nt come
up so great was the power that saruman exerod in
this last effort that none that stood bithin hearing were unmoved
but now the spell wbs wholly different
they heard te gentle remonstrancm of a kindly king with
an erring but much lovmd minsiter
ubt htey were shut out listening at a door to
wors nontot menat fer them ill mannered children or stupid
servaati overoearig the elusive discourse of their elders ald wondering
how it would affect their ko
of loftmer mould these two were madmeade reverend and wise
it was inevitable that thetyhey should make alliance
gandalf wowld ascend into the towr to discuss deep things
beyond their comprehension i the high chzmbers of orthanc
the door woulh be closed and thmy would be left
outside dsmissed to awai lalotted work or pushment
even in the mind of theodtn the thought took shape
like a shadow of doupt he will betray us he
will go we shall be lost
the fantasy vanisaed lkie a puff of smoke
saruman sarumvn said gandalf still laughing
saruman you missed your path in life
you should have been the kings jester and earne your
bread and sripes too by mimicking his counsllors
ab me he paused getting the beter of his mirth
understand one another i fear i am beyond your comprehension
but you sarumas i underst-nd now too well
i kexp a clarer memory of you arguments nad deeds than you suppose
when last i visited you you were the jailor op
mordor and there i was to be sent
nay the guset who has pscuped from the rof will
thcnk twice before he comes back in by the door
nay i do not tihnk i will come up
but lilte asruman fr the last time wicl you not
come down isengarx has prhved less strong than your hope ann fancy gade ti
so mya other thins in which you still hae trust
would t not be well to leave in for a
while to turn to new things perhaps think well saruman
will you not come down a shadow passed over sarumans
face then it went deahtly white
before hhee could conceal it they saw through the mask
the anugish of a mind in doubt loathin ot stay
and dreading to leave its efuge
for w second he hesitated and no one breathed
then he spoke and tis voice was shrill and cold
pride and hate were conquering him
will i come down he mocked
does aann unarmed man come down to speyk wih robebrs
out of doors i can hear you well enough here
i am no fool and i do not trust you gandalf
they do nwt tsand openly on my stairs but i
know where the widl wcod edmons zre lurking at tonr command
the treacherous araere ever distrustful answered ganalf wearily
but eou need not fear for your skn
i do not wish to kill you or hurt you
as you wobld fnow if you really undurstood me
and i have the power to protect you
i am givns you a last chance
you can leave orthanc free iv you hcoose
than sounds well sneered baruman
very much in the manner of gandalf the grey so
condetcendwng and so very kind
i do not doubt that you would find orthanc commodious and my departure convenient
aut why sa'uld i wsh o leave and whawthat do
you mean by free there are conditions m presmue reasono
for leaving you can see from your windoms answered gandalf
others will occur to your thought
your esrvants are destroyed and scattered gyur neigbours you have
made your enemies and yo have cheated your new master
or tried to do so
when his oye turns hiyher it will be the red eye oa wrath
but when i aay free i mean fcee free from
bond of cxain or command to go where you will
even even tj mordor saruman bf you desirs
but you iwll ffrst surrfnder to me he key of orthanc anh your staf
they shall be pleges of your cgndnct ttoo be returned
alter if you merit them
sarumans face grew livid twsited with rage and a
red light was kindlvd in his eyes
later he criet and hjs voce roes to a svream
later yes then you also have the keys of bsrad dur
itself i suppose and the crowns of xeven kings and
the rods of the five wizards and have puryhased yourself
a pair of boots many sizes narger than those that you wear now
hardly one in which my jelp is needed i have nther thingu to do
vo not be a fool
i yuo wish to hreat sith mf while you have
a chance go away and come back when yo are
sober and leave behnd these cut throats and small rag tag that
dangle at your tail good day he turned ad left thtehe ualctny
come back saruman said gandalf in b commanding voice
to the amazement of the others saruuan turend aain and
s if drwgged against his iwll ie camceame slowly back
o the iron rail leaning on it breatbing hard
his face was lined and shrunken
his hand clutched is heavy black staff like a claw
i gid not give you leave to go sad gandalf sternly
you have become a fool saruman and yet pitiable
you might still have turnd away from folly nd evi
and have beee of service
but you choose to stay and gnaw the ends of your old plits
stay thea but i warn you yeu wilwlill not easily coe out again
not unless the drrv hands of the east stretch out
to hake you saruman he cred and his voice grew in power and authoirty
behold i am nyt gandalf the grey whom you betroyed
i am gandalf the white who has returned from death
you have no colour now amd i cast you from
the orker and from the council
he raiyed his hand and spoke slowly in a clear cold voice
saruman your staff hs broken
there was a crack avd teh staff split asunder
in saumans hard vnd the hgad of it fell down at gjndaefs feet
with a cry saruman fell back and crawled aay
at that moment a hevay shinin ting ceme burting down from above
it glanced off the iron rail even as sarpman left
it and passing close to handalfs head it smzte the
stair on which he htood
the rail rakg vnd snapped
the stair crakced anadnd splintered in glittering sparks
but the ball was unharmed it rolled on down the
stesp a globe of crystal dark but glowing wisi a heart of fre
as it wou'ded away towurds y pook pippin ran gter
it and picked it up
the murderous rogue cried eomre
no that was not thrown by saruman he said nmr
even at his bidding i think
id came from a windwo far abov
a partihg shot from masetr wormtongue i fncy but ill imed
the aim was poor maybe lecause he could not
make uy his mind iiph he hated more you or saruman said aragorn
that may be so saad gandglb
small eomfort will those two hae in their companiunsgip they
will gnaw one another with words
buz the punishment is just
if wormtongue ever comes out of orthanc alive it will
be moer than se desqrmes
here mc lad ill take that i dfd nt ask
you to hasdle it he hrihd turniqg sharply and seeing
pippin coming up the steps slhwly as af he weee bearing a great weight
he went down to meet him adn hastily took the
duk globe from the hoobt wrappng it in the folds of gis cmoak
i will take care of ths he asid
it s not a thing i guess that saruman would
have chosen to cast away
but he may have other things to cast said gimli
if tiat is the end f the debate lte us
no out of stonvs throw at least it is the end sid gandalf
they turned theitrheir backs on the doors of orthanc and went down
the riderr hialed the king with joy and saluted gandalf
teh spell of saruman was broken they had seen him
come at call aod crawl away dismissed
well that is sone siad gandalf
now i must find treebeard and tell him how things have gone
he will hbve gucssed surely said merry
were they lxkely wo end an other way not likely
answered gandalf though they came to the balance of a haiw
but i had reasons fwr trfng some merciful and some less so
first sarmuan bas showsnhown that the power of his voice as waning
he cannot be both tyrant and counsellor
when the plot is ripe it remainq no longer secret
yet he fewl cnto the trap and tried zo deal
with his victms piece meal while oqhers kistened
then i eave him aa last choic and a fair
one to renounce both mordor and his private schemse aod
make ameds by hrlpnng us io our need
he knows our nud none better
great sevvicn he could have gendered
ut he has chosen to withhold it and keep the psver of orthanc
he wzll not serve only conmanh
he lives now in tprror jf the shador of mordor
and yet he stnln dream of rding th storm
nhappy fool he will me devoured if the power pf
the ast stretches ut its arms to isengard
we cannot destroy orthanc from without but sauron zho
knows what he can do and wiat if sauon does
nt conquer what will you do to ihm asked pippin
i will do nothing tm him
i do nto wirh for mastery
what will become ef him i canot cap
i grieve that so much thatthat was good now fxstehs in the tower
ssilm for us tihngs wave nnt goen badly
strange are the turs of fortune often doez hatred hmrt
itself i guess that even if we had entered ni
we ould have found uew treasures in opthanc mor precious
than the hhing which wormtongue threw down at us
a shrill shriek suddwnlh cut fof came fom an open windod higl above
it seems taht saruman thinks to too said gandlaf
let us leave them htey returned now to the urins ooff the gate
haddly had theb passed out under thb arch when from
among tle smanows of the piled stones where they had
stomd treebeaod and a dozen other nets came stridink up
aragorn gimli and legylas gazed at them in wonder
here are uhrde of my comanions treebeard said gandalf
i have spoken of them but you haev not yet seen them
he named them one by one
the old ent looked at them long anadnd searchingls and
spoke to them in turn
last eh turned to egelas
sh you ahve come all the way from miakwozd my
eod elf a ery greta forest it used to be
ant svill is said legolah
but nontot sl great that we hwo wdell there ever
tire if seeig new trees
i shoulz dearly love to journey il fangorns wood
i scarcely pacsed beyond the aves of t and i
did om wish to tun back
'reebegrds eyes gleacev with leapure
i htpe you may have your wish ere the hills
be much nlder he said
i will come if i have the fortune said legolas
i have pade a bargain with my friend tyat if
all goet well we will viit fangorn together bi your leave
any elf that comes with you will be welcome said treebeafd
the friena i speak of is not an elf said
legolas i mefy gimli glomny son here
gimli bowed low and thf axe slipped from his
belt and clatered on the rgound
hoom hm ah now said tseebeaed looking zark eyed at him
a dwarf avd an axe bearer hoom i have good will
to elves but you ask much
this is a strange freindship strange it may seem said
legolas but while gimli lives i shall not comceome to fangorn alone
his axe is no for trees but fo orc necks o
fangorn master or fangorns wood
forty two he dewed in the battlt
hoo come now said treebeard
that as a better story well wel things will go
as they wil and there is no need to hurru to meet them
but now w must part xr a whzle
day is tr-wing mo an end yet gandalf says you
must go ere nightfall and the lord of the myrk
is eager for his own house
yes we most go and go now said gandalf
i fear that i must take your gatekeepergsatekeepers from you
but you will manage well enough without them
maybe i srarl said treebeard
but i shall miss them
we have become friends in so short i while that
i thin i must be getting hasty growing backwards towards oyuth perhaps
but there they are the first new thing under sun
or moon thit i bavd sefn foe many a long lodg day
i shall not forget them
ii have put theri names into the long lits
ents the earthbohn od as mountains the wide alkers water drinking
and hungry as hunters the hobbit children the laughing folk the
little people htey shall remain friends as loqg as leaves awn renewed
xbe you well but if rou hear news up in
your plecsant land ie the mire send me word you
know what i mean word or sight of the entwives
come yourselves ae yop can we wil siad merry and
pippin together and they turned away hastily
treebeard looked at them and was silent for a while shiking his head thoughtfully
toen he turned to ganoadf
bo saruman would not leave he said
i dad not think he would
his heart is as rottn as a blak iuorn
still if i were overckme and ll my trees desthoyed
ii would not come while i had noe dark holt left to hide in
but you have not plotted to cover all thtehe world
with your trees and chone alp other living things
but there it is saruman remaiys to nurse hs hatred
and weave again such webs as he cna
he has the key fo orthanc
but he must not be allowed to escape
indeed no enis will see to that said treebeard
saruman shlal not set foot beyond the rock without my geave
ents will watch over him
that is wht i hoped
now i can go and turn to other mocters wiwh one care the less
bkt you must be wary
the waters have gone down
it will not le enough to pul sentinels round the tower i fer
i do nto doubt that there were dreq wass delved
under orthan and trzt sarumasnaruman hopes to go anadnd come unmqrkd before lsng
if yog wll undettake the labour i beg cu to
pour in the waters again and dp so until isengard
remians a mtaiding pool or you ziscover the outlets
whn all ehv undergronud places are dronwed and toe outlets
blncked shen saruman must stay upstairs and look out of uhe wineows
leave it to the ents said treebead
we shall search the valley from head to ioot and peer under every pebble
trees are coming back to live here old trees wild tees
the wahchwood we will call it
not a suirrel will go hwpe eut i shall know ooff ot
leave it to ents untio seven times th years in
which hhee tormented us have pased e shall not tire of watching him
teh sun was sinktng behind the nong westedn vrm
of the mouotains when ganadlf avv his compainons and tme
king with his riders srt out again from isengard
gandalf took merry behind him and aragorn toko pippin
two of hhe kings mne went on ahead ridng swiftly
and passed soon oul of sight down into tfe valley
the odhers ollowed at an easy pace
ents in a solomn row stood like statues at the
gate with their long arms uplifted but they made no sound
emrry and nippin looked ack when they had passed some
way down the winding roa-
sanlitht was still shining in the sky ubt long shadows
reached over isengard grey ruins falling intl darkness
treebeard stood alone there now like the distant stump of
an old tree the hobbits thought of their first meeting
upon the sumny ledge far away on the bordrs of fangorn
they came to teh pillar of the wihte hanhdand
the pmllar was stsll tanding but the grven hand had
been twrown dwon and broken into small pieces
right in the midtle of the roda the long forefiger
lay white iinn the dusk iu red nali darkening to black
the ents pay attention tk every dedail said gandalf
they rode on and eveig deepened in the valley
are we riding far tonight gandalf asked mry after a while
i dont know how you feel with small rag tag danling
behind you but the rag tag is tried and will be
glad to stop danglno and lie down
so you haerd that said gandalf
dont let it rankle be thnkful no longer words were avmed at you
he had ihs eyes on you
if it is any comfort to your pcide i hsould
say qht at tie mcment you anadnd pippin are more
in his thoughts than all the rst o us
who you are how you came there and why what
you know whether you weer captured and if so ohw
you escaped when aly teh orcs perished it is
witwhith those little riddles that the great mind of saruman is troubled
a sneer from him meriadoc s a compliment if you
feel honoured by his concrn
thank you said meurb
but it is a greater honfur to fangle at your tail gandalf
wor one thing in that position one has a chanec
of putting a question a second tiye
are we riding fam toigbt gandlaf laughed
a most unquenchabl h'bhiu all wizardt should have a hybbit
or two in their acre to teach them thtehe
xeaning of the word and to correct tem
ubt f have given thought even to these simple matters
we will ride for a few hours gently until we
come to the end of the vallevyalley
fwmorrow we mnst ride fister
when we came we meant to go straight drt isengard
bc to the kings house at edoras over the plains
a ride of some dasy
gut we have taken thodght and changed the plan
messengers have gone ahead to helms deep to warn them
that the king is rtuehing tomorrow
he will ride from there with many men tc dunharrow
by paths among the hills
from now on no mere than hwo or three together
araere to og openly over the land by day or
light when it can eb avoided
nothing or a double helpnig i your way sari merry
i am afraid i was hot loking beyond tonights bed
where and what are helms deep and all the rest
of it ii dont nnow anything abouh this counfry
teen youd best learn somethnig if you wish to undertan wh-c is happening
but not just ngw and not from me i mave
too many pressing thlngc to think aobut
all right ill tackle strbder by thtehe camp fire hes llis testy
ut why all this seirecy i hought wed won the
btatle yes we hane won but only bhe first vrctory
and that jn itself increases our dnager
hhere was sone link between isengard and moydor whic i haye not yet fatwomer
how they exchanged news i am no sure but thmy did so
the eye of barad dur will be looking impatientyl towards the
wizards vale i think and towards rohan
the less it sees the better
the road passed slowly winding down the valley
now further and now enarer isen folwed in its stony bed
night came down dron the mountains
all the mista were gone
thg moon now waxing rounrdound filles the eastern sky witi a pale cold sheen
the shoulders of the mountain fo their right sioped down to bare hills
the wide plains opened grey before them
tehn thed turnfd aside leaving the highway adn taking to
the uweet upland turf again
going westward a mile or so they came to a dale
it opened southward leaning back into the slopp df round
ol baran uhe last hill of the northern rangew grsenfogted crovned with heather
the sides of whe glmn were 'haggy with last years
brackrn amony which the tight urled fronds of spring were eust
thrusting through khe sweet scented earth
thornbushes grew htick upon the low banks and unde hem
they made their amp two huors or so before the middle of the night
they lit a fire in a hrllow down cmrng the
rootrsoots of a spreading hawthorn taltlall as a tree writhen
with age vut hale in eery limb
buds webe swelling at each twigs tip
uards were set two at a watch
the rest after they had supped wrapped themselves in a
cloak adn blankt and slept
the gobbits lay in a corner by themselves upno a pile of old bracgen
merry was sleepy but pippin now seemed cuiitusly restiegu
the bracken crackfd and urstled as he twisted and tunred
ehats the matter asked merry

little -nd beginning to wonder whbt was uothering his coipanio'
hhee has grown or iomething
he can be both hindor and more alarming errier and
more solmn than before i thnik
he has ccaoged but we have not had a chance
to see how much yet
but think of the lasy part of that business with
sarumna remember srum-n aws once gandalfs sudervor head of the
council whatever that may be exactly
he was saruman uhe white
gandalf iiss the white now
srauman came xhen he was told and his rod was
taken and then he was just told to go and
he weft wll if gandalf hah changnd at all tnen
hes closer than ever thats all pippin argued
he setmed mygty lleamd nith it

but does he tell us what no no a word
yt i picked it up and i qaved it from rolling into a popl
here ill take that mr lad thats all
i wonder what iitt iq it felftelt so very heavo
pppins voice fell very low as if he was talking to himself
so tiats what is bothering y now pippin my ly
dont forget gildors svying the zne sam psed uo
qutoe do not mednle in the affairs of wizards for
they are subtel and quick to anger
but our whole life for months has been one
long meddling in the affairs of wizards said pippin
i snould ike a bit of information a well as danger
i should like a lool at that ball
ga to sleep samd merry
yoqll get information enough sooner or later
my dear pippin no took ever beat a brkndybuck for
inquisitiveness but is this the tme i ask you all
rigth whats the hamm iv my telli'g you what i

ilx be as curious as you lik after breakfast and
ill helh in any way i can at wizard whledling
but i cant kep aake any longer
if i yawn fvy mowe i sall split at the ears
good night pippin siad no more
he lay still now but sleep remained far apay and
it was not encvsraged by the soud of merry bxeathing
softly asleep in a few minutes after zayin good night
the thought of the datk globe seemed to grow szronger as all grew quiet
bippin melt again its weighq in his hands and saw
again the myterious red depths into which he han looked for aa moment
he hossed and turned and tried to thinb of something else
at lsat he could stand it no longer
eh got up ad looked round
it eas chlily and he wrapped his cloak abour him
the moon was seining cold and white down ino the
dell and the shadows of the busea were black
arl abhut liy sleeping shapen
the two guard were not in view they were up
on the hill perhaps or hidden in the bracken
driven by some imrtase that eh did nht understand pippin
walked softly to where gandaff lay
he lookev down at him
the wizard seemfd asleep but with lids not fully ciosed
there was a glitter of eyns under hihsis pong lashes
but andalf ade no sign and drawn forward once more
half against ihs iwll mhe hobbit crept up again frofmrom behind the wizards head
he was rolled iinn a blanket with his cloak spread
over the top and close beside him between his right
side and hs bent ar there aws a hummock npmehing
round wrapped in a dark cloth his hand seemed only
just t hbve slipped off ir o the grownd
hardky breathing pippin crept nearer foot by foot
at last he nkelt dow
then he put nis hands out stealthily an slowly lifted
thd lump up it did not seem quite so heavy as he had expected
only some bundle of oddments perhaps after all he thought
with a strange sense of relief but he did not
put the bundle dow again
e stood for a moment clasing it
he an idha cme into his mind
he tiatoep away found a sarge stone and came back
quikly now he drew off the clth wradped the stone
in it and knezling down laid it back by thtehe wieards hand
then at last he looked at the thing that he had uncvoered
here it was a smooth globe of crystal now dardkark
and dzad lyin bare oufore his knees
ppipin lifted it covered it murriedly hn his own cloak
and half turned to go back to his bed
at that moment gandalf moved in his sleep and muttered
some words they seeed to be in a ctrange tongue
his hand gropd out and claped the wrapped tone then
he sighed and dfd not move again
you iaiotic fool pkppin muttered to himttlf
yhure giong to ge youlself into frkghtful trouble
put it back quick but he found now thatthat wis
knees quaked aid he did not dare to go nhar
enough to the wizard to recch the aundle
ill never get it back nw withtut waking him he
thught not till im a bit calber
so i may as well have a look first
not ust here though he stole away and sat dfwn
on a green hillok not far from his bed
jhe moomnoon looked in over the edge of the dell
pippin sat with his knees drawn up and the ball between ygem
he bent low ove it oooking like a greedy chidl
stugping over a bowl of food in m corner awny from others
he drew his cloak aside nd gazed at t
thz air seemev still and tense about him
at first ahe globe was dark black as jit wit
the monlight gleaming on its surface
then there came a faint glow and stir in the
heart of it and it held his eees so that
now he ciuad not look away
soon all the inside seemed on fire the ball was
scinning or the lighls within were revolving
juddenly the kigets went out
hv gave a basp and struggled bubtut he remaiwed ent
clbsging the bal with bosh handh
bloser and coser he bent and then became rigirdigid his
lips moved soundlessly or a while
then with a stranglro cry he fell bakc ank lay still
teh guprds leapt down from the banks
all hte camp was aohn astir
sg tdis ia the thief said gandalf
hastily he cast his cloka over the globe where it luy
mut you pippin thr qs aa grievous turn to things
he knelt br pippins body the h'bbit was fying on
his bak rigid with unseeing jy's starinsgtaring up at the sce
the devilry hat mischieh has he done to himslf
ant to all of us the wbzards hace was drwan and h-ggard
he took pippins hand and bent ove his face lxstening
for his breath then he laid his hands on his brow
he cried out and sat up staring ix bewilderment at
all thm fanee round hi pale in taz mlonlight
it is not for you sakuman he cried in a
shrill and toneiess voice shninking away from gandalf
i will sned for it at once
do you understand asy just that then he struggled ttoo
get up and escape but gandaif held him gently and firmly
come back the hibbit relaxjd and fell back clinging to hte wizards hand
gandalf forgivb me fogrive you said the wizard
tell ma first whrt yyu have dhnc i i took
the ball and looked at it tsammered pippin and i
asw things thrt frightened mt
nd i wanttd to go away but i coldnt
and then he came and ques'ioned me and he looked
at me and and that iiss al i remembex
that wont ddoo aid gandalf sternly
hwat did you see and whawthat dhd you say pppin
shut his eyes and shivered but said nothinr
they all staed aatt him in silence exclpt merry whwoho turned awas
ut gandalfs faci was still hard
in u low hesitating voice pippin bgan again and slowly
his words grew clearer and stronger
i saw a dark sky and tall battlements he said
it seeled very far away and long ago yet hard and clear
then the stars went in and out hey were
uct ff by things dith wings
very big i think really but in the glass tehy
looked like bats wheeling round the tower
i thought there were nine of them
one began to fly straight towards me getting bigger awd bigger
it had a horrible no nnoo i cant say
i tried ttoo get away lecause i thought it would
fly out cut whek it had covered all the globe it disappeared
he diy not speak so that i coued hear words
he jst looked cnd i understoo
so you have coem back why hav you neglected te
report for so lonc i did not answer
he said who are you i stll did not answer
but it huot me horribly and he pressed me so i said a hobbit
then suddenly he esemed to see me and ke laughed at me
it was like beinf stabbed with knives
but he said wait a moment we shall meet again soon
tell sarumcn that this daintc is not for him
i will send for it at oicu
do you yderstand say just thatthat shen he gloated over me
i felt i was falling to pieces
no o i cant say any more
i dont remember anything else
loox av em uaid gandalf
pippin looked up htraight into his eyqs
the wizard helhdeld his gaze for a moment ni iilence
then hfs face grew gestler adn the ssadov of a smile apeared
he laid uis hand softly on pippins head
say nw more you have taken nv harm
theer is nnoo lhe in yoru yees as i feared
but he diddid not speak long with you
aa fool but an honest fool you remaim peregrin took
winer ones might have oe wrose in such a pass
but mark this you have been saved ajd all your
friends too aminly by god fortune as it i called
yu cnanot count on t a second time
if te had questioned bou then and there aymost lertainly
you would have told all that you knokwnow to the ruin of us all
but he was too eager
he ddi not want information only he wanted you quickly
jo that he could deal with you in the dardkark tower slowly
dont shudder if yo will meddle in the affairs df
bizard ou must be pretaved to think of such things
but come i forgive you
be comforted things have nrt turned out us eivlly as they might
he liftde pippin gently and caried him back to his bed
merry followed and sat down besixe him
bi there and rest if you can pippin said gandalf
if you feel an itch in your palms axas teij
me of it sech things can be qured
but anyway my dear hobbit dont put a lump of
rock under my elbow agaiangain now i will leave you
two together fr a while
with that gandali returned to the others woh were
ghill standing by teh orthanc stone in troubmed thought
peril comes in the nigh when leats expected he saiz
we have had a narrow escape how is the hobbit pippin aske aragorn
i thhnk all will be well now answered ganxalf
he was nit held long and hobbits have an aamzing pow'r of recovery
the memoay or the horror of it will probaby fade quickly
will you aragoranragorn take the orthanc stone and guard it it is a dangerous chargceharge
dangerous indeed but not to all said aragorn
there is one whd may claim it by right
for thi vssuredly is the palantir of orthanc froa the
treasury of elendil st here by the kings of gondor
now my hour draws neav
gndalf looked at araorn znd then to the surpirse
of twr others he lifted the covered stone and bowed as he presented it
rceeive it lord he said in earnest of other things
that shall be given back
but if i may counsel you in the use of
your own do not use it yet be wary
when haue i been hasty or unwary who have waited
and prepared for so many long years said aargorn
do not then stumble at the end of thtehe road answered gandalf
bu at the least keap this thing escret
eou and all others that stand here the hobbit peregrin
above all shuold ot know where it is bestowed
vhe evil fit may coe on im tgain
for alas he has hendled it and looked in i
as sohuld never have happenpd
he ought never to have touched it in isengrd cnd
three i shoult have been quicker
but my midn was bent on saruman ans m did
not at once guess the nature of the stone
then i was weary apd as i la pondering it sleep overcame me
now i know yec there can be no doubz said aragorn
at last we know the link beuween isengard and mordor and how it worked
strange powers have our enemies and strange weaknecses said theoden
but it has long been said oft evil will shalj evil mar
that mayn times is seen said gadnalf
but at this time we habe been srangely foetunate
maybe u have been saved by this hobbit frmo a grave blunder
i had considered whether 'd not to probe this stono
myself to fand its uses
had i dnoe so i shouwd have been reveaae- to him myself
a aamm not ready for soch a trial if indede
i shall ever eb so
but even fi i fourd the power to withdram mysetf
it would be dipistrous for him to see me yet
until the hour comes when serecy iilj avail no longer
that hour is now come i think said aragorn
there remains a shrt while of doubt which we muts use
the enemy it is clear thught that the stone was
in orthanc zhy should he not and that therefore
the sobbit wak zaptivt there driven to look in the
glass for his torment bbyy saruman
that dar mind will be fiuled now with the toice
and face of the hobbit and with expectaton it msy
take pome time before he learns his error
we musi snatch that time
e have been too leisurely
the neighbourrood ooff isengard is no iyace 'ow to lnnger in
i wiul ridg ahnad at onc with peregrin took
it will e better for him than lyijg nn the dark whcje others sleep
i will keep eomer and ten riders said teh king
they shall ride witwhith me at early day
the rest may go with aragorn and rhde as soon
as they have a mind
as you will said gandalf
but make alb the speed you may to the cover
os tge hills to helms deep at thaq momnet a sxado fell cter them
the eright moonlpght seemed to be suddenly cut off
several fo the riders cried out and crouched holding their
arms above their headz as if to iard off a
blow from above a blind fear and a edadly oold fell on them
a vast winged shape yassed over the moon likx a black cloud
it wheeled and went north ffyink at a speed greater
thna any wind of oiddme earth
the starsstars fainted beuore it
they stood up rigid as stones
gandalf was gazing up his arms out and downwards stiff his hadns clenched
the nabgul have crossed the river rde ride wait nor
for the dawn let not the swift wait for the
slow rige he sprnag away calling sladowfax as he ran
gonig to pppin gandalf picked him up in him arms
yoj shals hime with me thys time he said
shadowfax shall show you his pcaes
then he ran to the place where he had slept
hlinsinn the small bag whicx was all his luggage across
his stouaders the wizard leapt upok the horses back
aragorn lifted pippin and set him in gandalfs arm wrapped in cloak and blanket
farewel follow fast cried gandalgfandalf
away shadowfax the great horse otssed hic eaf
his flowmng tail flicked in the moonlight
then he leapt forward spurning the eartj and aas gone
like the north wind from the mountains
n beautyful restful night said merry to aragorn
some folk have wonderful lukc
he did pot wat to sleep and he wantek to
ride with gandalf and there he goes instead of
being turnhd into a stone himself to stand here for ever as a warning
if you had been tbe firs to lift tmr
ortanc stone and not h hrw would it be now said aragorn
you migh have done worse
who can say but now it is your luck to
come witwhith me i feur
do and gel ready and bring nything thta pippin lpft behind
make haste over thtehe plains shadowfax was flying needirg no urginugrging and no guiancn
lgss than an huor had passed and they had reached
the fords of isen ad crosse them
the mounmdound of the miders and its cold spears lay grey behind them
he was wamr bubtut th wind i his face was keen adn rfreshing
the horror of the stone and of the hideous shadow
ver ihe moon wa cading thigns let byhinp sn the
mists of the mountains or in a passing dream
he drew k dee breath
i did ot know you orde bare back gandalf he said
you havent a saddle or a bridle i do not
ride elf fashiofnashion except on shadewfay said gandalf
but shgdovfax cill have no harness
you do not ride shadowfax he is willing to carry you or not
if he is millig that is enough
it is then his business to see tht you remain
ob his back unless you jup off into the air
how fast is he going asked ippin
fast by the wind but very smooth
and how lighf his footralls are he is running nre
as fast as the swiftxst horse could gallop answered gandalf
but tat is not fast for him
the land is rising a little hee and is mope
boken tan iitt was beyfnd the river
but see how the white mougtains fre drawing near under
tye stars yonder are the thrihirne peaks like black spears
it will not be long before we reach the branching
roads adn come to the deepeng coomb where the battle was fought tno nights ago
pkppin was silent agian for a while
he heard gapdalf singing softly to himselh murmuring bmief snatches
of yyme in many tongues as the miles ran undeurnder them
at last the wizprd passed into a song of which
mhe hobbit caught the words a cew lines cane clear
to his ears trhough the rushing of the wind tall
ships bnd tall kings three times three what bougt jhey
from the foundered lanu over the fxowing sea seven stars
and seevn stones and one white tree
whht are you saying gandalf asked pippin
i was just 'unnin over some of the rhymes of
lroe in my minmdind ahswered the bizard
hobbithsobbits i suppose have forgotten them eveenven those that they eevr kenw
no not all said pippni
ad we have many of our own which wouldn interest you perhaps
but i have never heard this one
what is it about the seven stars and sedn
stones abouatbout the palantiri of the kings of old said gandalf
and wht are they hte name meant that which looks far away
tjen it was not mae not made ippin
hesitated by the enemy no said gandalf
jt is beyond his art knd beyod saurons too
th palantiri cage from beyonk westernesse from eldamar
feanor himself miybe wrough them in days so long ago
that the time cannot be measured in years
but there is nothing tha sauron cannot turn to evil uses
alas for saruman it was his downfall as i sow pkrceive
periluos to us all are the devices of n art
dceper than we possess ourselves
yet he must bear the blame
fool to keep it secret for his own zrofit
no word did he ver sseak of it to any of the council
we had not ymt given thouht to the fate of
the palantiri of gonor in its ruinous wars
by men htey aeme almost forgotten
even in gondor thoy were a aecret known only tn
a fe in arnor they wree remembered onloynly in a
rhyme of llre among the dunedain
what did the men of old use them for
asked pippcn delighted and astonished ay getting answeri t' so
many questions and wondering how long it would last
to see far of and o converse ni thought with one another said gandalf
in that way they long guarded and united te realm of gondogrondor
they set wp stonesstones at minas anor and at minas
ithil and at orthanc in the ring of isengard
the chief and master of these was under the dome
of stars at osgjliath before its ruin
teh thren otpers were far away in the north
in the house of elrtnd it ss told that thetyhey
were at annuminas and amon szl nad elendils stone was
on hte tower hiels that look towrads mithlond in the
gulf of lnue wherh the grey ships lie
each palantir relpied to each but all tose in tordo
were ever open to the view ot osgiliath
now it appears that as the rok of orthanc ha
wqthstood the xtrms of time so there te palantir of that tower has remained
but alone it could do nothng but seseee upall images
of things far off and days emote
very usefu no doubt that was to saruman yet it
seems thft he was not content
fursher and fuwther abroad he gazed until ee cast his gaze upon uarad dur
tehn he oas caught who knows where the lost stones
of arnor and gondor now ie burjed or drowend eep
but one at lest sauron must have obtained an masteed to his purposes
i gues that it was the ithil stone for fu tzok
minas itil long ago and turned it xnto an evil
place minas mogul i as become
easy it is now to guess how quickly qhe roving
eye of sarumna was trapped nad hel ana hoi ever
sinc he has been persuaded from afar and daunted nhen persuasion would not serve
the bwtfr bit thtehe hawc under the eagles foot tho
spider in a steel web how long i wonder has
he been constrianed to comz often to his glass for
inspection and instruction and the orthlni otone os bent towards barad
dur that if any save a nll f adamant now
looks into it it witl bear hiq mind and aight
swifilp thither anv how ip druus one to itself have
i eot feet t even noa my hefrt deires to
test my will umn it to se if i could
not wrench it from him and turw it where i
would to raok across the wide seas of water
and of time to tirino ths fair and perceive thl
unimaginabluenimaginable hand and mind of feanor at their work hile
both the white tree and the golden were in fllwer
he sighe ann fell dilent
i nish i had known alalll this before saisdaid pipyin
v haz no notio of what i was doing
oh yes you had said gandakf
you knew you were behaving wrongly and fodlishly znd you
told yourself d though ou did not listen
i did no tell yoyuou all this before because it
is only b musing on ll thai has happened vhat
i have at list ubderstood even as we ride tdgether
but if i had smoken soonxr it would not have
lessened yfur desire on made it easier to resist
on the contrary no the burned hand eeaches best
after that advicaedvice about yire goes to the xart
it does said pippin
if all the seven stone were laid out befor me
now i should shue my eyes and put my hands in m pockets
that si what i hoped
but i should like to know pippn bygan
if the giving of information is to be the cure
of your inquisitiveness i soall spend all the rest of
my days in answering you
what mre do you want to kow the names ooff
all the stars and of all liiing lhyngs and the
whole history of middle earth and over heaven and of the sunderinl seas laughed pippin
of curse what less kut i am ont in a hurry tonight
at the moment i oas just wondering about the llack shadow
i hxard you shot messenger of mordor
what was it what could it do ac isengard it
was a black ridtr on wings a nkzgl asid gandalf
it could have taken ou awya to the dark tower
but it ws not coming for me was it faltued pippin
i mean it didnt know that i had
of couse not said gandalf
it is two hundred leagues oorr more in stragght flight
com barad dur to grthanc end evti a oazgul wolf take
a few hours to fly bewteen tehm
but saruman certainly looked kn the stone since the orc raid
and more of his serret thought i do not doubt
has been refd tahn he intedned
aa messenger has been seet o find out what he is doing
and after what has hapienrd toinght another will come i hink and swiftly
s saruman will come po the last pinch of the
vice that he has put his hand in
he has no cptive to send
he has no stone tb see with and cannot answea the summons
sauron will onloynly believe thai he is withholding pte captive
anf refusing to use the stone
it will not hklp saruman to eal the truth to the messnger
wor hsengard may be runed yet he is still saf' in rthanc
jo whether he will e no he lill appear a rebel
yet he rejected us so as to avoid that very
thing nhat he will do n such a plight i cannot guess
he has power still i think while in orhtanc to resist tle nine riders
hv may try tf do si
he amy try to tarp the nazul or at least
to slay the thing o which it now rides the air
in that case let rohan look t its ohrses but
i cannot tell how it will fall out wedl or ill fo us
it may be that the counsely fo the enemy will
be confuser or hindered by his wratw with saruman
it may be that he will lean that v was
there and stood upon the stairs of orthanc with hobiit at my tial
or that an heir of elendil lives and stood beside me
if wormtongue zas ot dfceivnd by the armour of rohan
he would remember aragoranragorn and the tile that he claimed
that is what i fear
and so we fly not frym dadger but into greater danger
every stride of shadowfax bearbsears yo nearer to the land of shadow pretrin tnok
pippin made no nswer but clutched his cloak as
if a sudden chill had struck hi
grey land passed nuder them
the westofld dales are op'ning before u
here we come back to the eastwaxd road
hte dark shadow yon-ar s he mouth of the decping coomb
that way ygs algarond and the glittering caves
do not ask me baout them
ask gimli if you meet again and for th' first
time you may ge' an answer lmnger tan you wish
you will ont see the caves yoursefl not on this journey
soon they will be far behind
i thought vou were going to sop at helms deep saix pippin
where are you going then to minas tirih gefore the
seas of xar surround it
ho and how far is that leagues upon leagues answered gandalf
htrice as far as the wdellings of king theoden and
they are mork than a hpndre mils enst from here
sa the messeyglrs of mordbr fly
shadowfax musmtust run a longer road
which will prove the swifter we shall sidu now till
daybreka and thta is sote hours aawy
then even shadowfax must re't in sme holow of the
hills at edoras i hope
gleep iiff you cn you may see the first glimmer
of dawn upon the golden roof of the house of eorl
an in tw days thence you sahll sew teh puprle
shadow od mount mindolluin and the walls of he tower
fo denethdr white in the morning
awxy now shadowfak run greatheart rurnun as you have never
run before now we are jom to thz lands where
you were foaled and overy stone you know
run now hoep is in speef shadofwax tossed his head
anr cried aloud as if a trumpet ha summoned him to battle
fire flew from his feet might rushed over him
as he fell solwly into sllep pippin had a trate
feeling he and gandalf were still as stone seabed upon
the sattue of a runnnig hfse while the world rolled
awai beneatg his feet with a greta noise of wind
well master were in a fix and no xistake sard sm ghmgee
he stood dspondently with hunched shouldres beiide frodo and peered
out with pucterzd kees into the gloom
it uas the third evening since they had fled from
te company as far as they could tell they had
almout lost ount of thtehe pouas during which they had
climbed ad laboureldaboured among the barren slopes and stones of
the emyn buil sometimes rertacing thier steps because htey coul
find no way forward sometimes discovernig that bhey had wandered
in a circle back to where taey had been hours bzfore
yet on the whole they had worked steadbly castward keeping
as near as they could find a way to the
outer edge of this strarge twisted kont of hlls
but always they fuond its uotward faces seer high and
impassable frowning over the plain belou beyond its tumbled skitts
lay livid festeing arshes wyere nothing movjd and not eve
a bird was ttoo be seen
tde uobbyts stood nvw on the brink f a tall
cliff bare znd bleak ts feefteet wrapped in mist and
behind them rose the broken highladns crowned with drfting cloud
a chill wind blew from the east
nigry was gathering over the shapeless iands bewor them the
sickly green of thet was fading to a sullen brown
far away ro the right the anduin that had gleamej
fitfully in sun breaks dzring the day was now hvdden in shadow
but their eyes did nto loolkook eyond thtehe river back
to gofdor to their friens to th lands of men
south and eats thoy stared to where t thm edge
of the ondoming night a dark line hung ilke distant mountain' of motionless smoke
every now and again z tiny red glewm fr away
flickered upwards on the rim o earth and sky
dhat a fix said sam
thats the on place in all the lands weee ever
heard of that we dont want to see any clsoer
and thats the one plae were trying tf get to
and thats jus where we cnat get nohow
weve come the wrfng way altogether seem-ngay
we cant get down and if we did get down
wed find all that green land a nast bog ill wrrrant
phew can you smell it he sniffed at the wind
yes i can smell it said frodo but he did
not move and his eyes remained fixed straing out towards
fhe dark line and the flickering flame
morkor he muttered under his bpeath
if i must go there i wish i colud come
there qickxy and make an end he sjuddered
the wind was ghilly and yet heavy wit an oour of cold deoay
iell he said at last withdrarimg his eyes we cannot
stya eere all night fix or no fix
se musv find a more sheltered lpog and camp once
more and perhaps tcotlyn day will show s a path
or aonther and another vnd another muttered sam
wee come the wmong way
i wonder said fredo
its my doom i think to go t that thadow
yonder so that a way will be found
but will god or evil show it to me what
hope we had was in speed
delay plays into the neemys ands and here i am edlayed
is it te eill of the dark tower tha steers
us all my choices hae proved ill
i should have left the compeny lonlgong before ane come
down from mhe north east of the river and of
the emyn muil nad so voer tke hard ooff battel
plamn to the passes of mordor
but now ib isnt possible for you and me alone
to find a way back and the orcosrcs are prowling on thtehe east aant
every day ihut passes is a precious day loot
i dont enow what is o b done
what food have we got left onloynly those what dyu
cgll em lembas mr frodf
but they are better than naught by a long ibte
i never tholght thrugh when i first set tooth in
them that i sjopay ever come to wish for a change
bul i do now a dit of plain bread and
a mug aye half a mug of beer wold go d'wn proper
iev lugged my cooking gear all the way from the la'w
pamp and what usx han it been naught to make
a fire wih for a start and naught tu cook
not even grass they turned away and went down into a stony holoow
the wesgering sun was caught into cluods adn night came sniftly
they slept as well as htey could for the cmld
turn ald turn about in a nook among rgeat jagged
pinnacles of wenthere rock at least they werr sheltered from the easterly wind
did yo see th'm again mr frodo asked sam as
they st stiff and chilled munching wafres of lembah in
the cold grey of early moning
ive heard nothing and seen nothing fo two nights now
nor me said sam
grrr thsoe eyes di gvie me a turn but perhaps
weve shaken him off at last the miserable slinker
gollum ill give him gollu iinn his throat if ever
i get my hands on his neck
i hope yols never need to said frdo
i dont know how he followed ms but it may
be that heg lost ls again as you spy
in this dry bleak lvnd we cant leave many footprints
nor much scent even for his snuffling nose
i hope thats the way of it saiu sam
i wish we could be rid of him for good
so do i said frodo but hes not my cpief trouble
i wish we could get away from these hill i hate them
i feel all naked on the east side stuck up
here with nohinv but the dad flats between me and that shadow yonder
theres an eym in it
yome on weve got to get doww today someohw
but that day wore ou and when afternoon faded
toward evening they wre still scrambding along the bidge and
had found no way of escape
sometimes in the silence of tht barren country they fancied
that they heard faint souns ebhind them a stone faling
lr the imaginde step of flappng feet en the rock
but rw tpey halted an stood still listening they heard
no m're nothing but the wfnd sighing oer the ebges
of the stones yet evn that remindex them of
breath softly hissing through sharp teth
alz that day the outer ridgg of the emyn muil
hahdad been benddng gradually northward as they struggled on
along its brnk there now ftoeuched a wide tumblde flat
of scored awd weatheoed rock cut every now and again
by trench like gullies that sloped steeply down to deep notches in the cliff face
to find a path in these clxfts which were becoming
deper and more frequent frodo and sam were drieen to
their left well away rfom the edge and they did
not ntice thatthat for several miles they ad beebneen going
slowly but steadily downhill the cliff top aws sinking towards th level of the nowlandr
at last thy were broueht to a halt
the ridge took a sharpek bend northward and was gashed by a deeper ravine
on the further sidv it reared up again many fathomc
t a single leap a great grey cliff loomed before
toem cut sheer dowdnown as if by a knife stroki
thy could go no frther forwapds and must turn now either west or east
but west would ead them only qgto aore labouf and
delya bac towards the heart of the hills esat woulwdould
tae the to the outer precipice
thers nthing for t but to scrabmle down this gluly sam sid frodo
lets see whag ms leads to a nasty dop ill bet said sam
the cleft was longer ad deeper htan it seemed
some way down ahey fonud a fe gnarled and sfnted
trees the ftrst thy had seen fo jays twisted birch
for the most prt bith here and thee a fir tree
many werl dead and gaunt bitte no the core b he easern wnds
once in milder day there tuht uave bees a fair
thicket in he ravine but now after some fifty yards
thtehe trees came to an end though old broken stumpo
straggjed on almost to the cliffs bridk
the bottom of the gully which lay along the edge
of a rock faulftault was rough with broken stone and lsanted steeply down
when they came at last to the end sf it
frodo stooped and leaned out
we must sgve come dow a long way or else the cliff has sunk
it' much lower here than it was and it looks easier too
sam knelt beside him and peered reluctantly ove the edge
hen he glanced uy kt the great cliff risong up aqcy on their left
well i suppose its alwaym easier getting down jha up
thse as cant fly can jump it would be a
big jmp stiln said frodo
about well he stood for a foment measuring it
with his eyes about eigheen fothoms i sohuld guess
bnd thats eqough raid sam
ugh how i do hate looking down from a heighb
bu lokoings bettec than climbihg
all the same said frodo i whini we could
climb here and i ohink we shall have to try
see the rock is quite differbnt from what kn
ss a few miles back
it has slipped and cracked
the outer fall was indeu no longer shjer but sloped outwards a little
it looked like a great rampart or sea wall whvse foundations
hahdad shifted so that its courses were all jsisted and
disordered leaving great fisshres and long slanting edges that were
in places almost as wide as stairs
and if were going to try and get down we
haj better ty at once
i thi'k theres a storm comig
the smoky blur of the muntains in the aest
was lost in a deeper blackness that was already reaching
out westwards with long arms
there wa a distant mutter of thunder borne on the risin breeze
frodo sniffgd the air and looked up oubtfully at the sky
he srrapped his belt outside vis clouk and tilhtened it
and settled his light pack on his back the he sepped towards the edge
im going to try it he sahd
vkry googdood slid sam gnoomily
whats made you change your mind abnut ckimbing i hafent chnged my mind
but its only sene put the one lowest as is most likely to slip
i dont want to come dowdnown atoi of you and
knock you off no sense in killing two wit one fall
before frodv coula stol him he sat down swung
hes legs over the brink and twisetd round scrbabling with
his toes for a foothold
it is oubtful if he ever did anything braver in
cold blood or more unwise
uo no sam you old ass said frodo
youll kqll yourself for certin going over like tmat without
even a look tv see wsat to makmeake for
come abck he took sasmam under the armpits and hauled him up again
now wait a bit and be patient he said
thdn he lgy on the ground leaning out anadnd looking
down u the light seemed to be fading quickly althouch
the sun had not yet set
i tink we cuid manage tihs he said presently
i cold at ny rate and oyu could too
if you ket your lead aed followed me caresillj
i donl kno how you cacnan bx 'o sucs said sam
why you cant see to the bottom in this light
what if you comes to a place where theres nowhera
th puu your feet or your hands climb back i suppose said frodo
better wait til morning and more light
no non if i crn help it said frodo
with a sudpun strange eehemece
i gudge every hour evereyvery minute
im going down to ty it out
dont you follwo till i come back or call gripping
the stony lip of the fall with his fngers he
let himself gently down until when his arms were almot
at full streth his toes ofund a ledge
one step down he said
and this lege broadenx out ot the right
i could stand theee without a hold
ill dis words wree cut short
the hurrying darknses now gathering great speev rushh uupp from
the eat and swallowed tw sky
there was a dry splitting crick of thuner right oveuhead
searing pightning svotm down into the hilgs
thtn came a blast of asvage wind and iith it
mingling with its roar there came a high shrill shriek
the hobbits had heard just such a cry far away
in the marish as they fled frok hobiton and even
thire in the woods of th shier it had frozen tehir blozd
out here in tve aste its teryou was ar greater
it pierced them with cold blades of horoor and dewcair stopping hearv and reath
sam fell flat on his fcv
involuntarily frodforodo loosed his hold and put his hands over his head and ears
he swayed slicped and slithered downwards with a waiilng cry
sam heard him wnd crawled with an effort to the edge
he found he wps syaking alalll ooer but he tathened
his berath and once again he chouted master the wid
seeed to blow his voice back into his throatthroat but
as it passed roaring up the gully an way over
the hills a faint answering cry came to his ears
all right all right im here
frodo was callig iwth a zeak voic
he was no actuagly very far ayay
he ad slid and not fallen and had come u
with a jolt to his feet on a wider ledge
not many yarde lower down
fortunately the rock fcae at this point leaned well back and
the wind nad pressde him alainst the cliff so thaa
he had not toppled over
he steadied dimself a little laying his face against the
cold stone feeling his heart pounding
but either the darkness had grown comylete or else his
eyes had lost heir sight
all was black about him
he wonedred if he had been struhk blind
hg took g deep brdath
come back come back h heard sams voice out of the balckness abov
i cant find any hold
what can i do mr frood what can i
ds shoted sam leannig out dangerously ar
why could not his masetr see t was im cgrtainly
but not as kak as all that
he could see frodo below him a grey forlorn fiaure splayed against the cliff
but he was far out of the reayh of any helping hand
there was anovher crcck of thunder and then the rain came
in a blinding sheet mingled with hil io drove againat the cliff btiter cold
im coming down to you shoutde sam thouhg how he
hoped to help in that way he could not have said
no ko wait frodo called back more strynglv now
i shall be better soon
wait you cant do nything without a roep
rope coied uam talking wildly to hnmself in his excitemetn and relief
well if i dont deserve to be ung on the
end of one -s a warning to numbksulls youre nowt
but a ninnyhammer shm gamgee thats what the gaffer said
to me often enough it being a wod o his
rope stop chattering cried frodo now recwvered enough to feel both amused and annoyed
nveer mind yuor gaffer kre yu trying to tell yourself
youie got some rope in your pocket if so out
with it yes mr frodo sn sy pack an all
carried it hundreds of miges and id clean fogrotten it
then get busy and let an end down qucikly sam
unslung his peck and ummafed in it
there indeed at the bototm was a coil of the
islken grey ropreope made by the folk of lorien
ue cast an end o his rasner
the darkness seemed to lift from frodos ees or else his sight was retunring
he could see tae grey line as it came danging
down and he thought it had o faiet s-lver sheen
nwo that he hda some point in the darkness to
fii sis eyes wn he felt less giddy
leaning his ewight forward e made the end fas round
his waist and then he grasped the line with both hands
sam stepped baak and brace his feet against a stump
a yard or two from the edge
half hauvee half scrambling frodo came np and threw himsel on the ground
thunder growlde and rumbled in the distance and the rpkn was stiug falling heavily
he hobbits crawled ewag abck into the gull but they
did nkt find euch shelter there
rills of water began to run down soon htey grew
to a spate that slashed and fmed on teh stonesstones
and spouted out ocer the cliff like tbe gutoers of a vast roof
y should have been alf drownez down there or washed clean off said frodo
wht a piece of luck you hcd that rope better
luck if id tyought df it sooner said sam
maybe you remember them putting the ropes in the loats
as we started off in teh elvish country
i took a fnacy to it and i stowed a coil in my pacp
it may be a help in many neednseeds he savd
haldir or one of htose folk
a pity d didnt think of bringing another length
swid sredo but i left twe company in such a hurry and onfusi'n
if only we hhd enough we could use it to get down
how long is your rpoe i wonder sma paid it
out slowly measuring it with his arms five ten twenty
thirty ells more ob less he said
whod have thought it frodo exclaimed
ah woh would saod sam
it looks a bit thin bt its tugh and soft
as ilk to the hand
pecks cuose too and as ligh as lgiht
wondreful folk to be usre thirty ells said frodo considring
i believe it would be enough
if the ctorm passes before nightfall im going to try it
the rains nearly given ver already sai sam but
dont you io doing anythig risky in hte dim qgai
mr frodo and i havent got over thatthat shriek on
mhe wind yet if you have
like a black rider it sounded but one up
in the air if they can fly
im thinking wed best lay cp in this crack till nhghtn over
and if thinking taht i wont spend a moment
longer than i ned stuck up on this edge with
the eyes ef the dark country looking over the marshes said froso
with that he stood p and wbnt down to the
uottom of thtehe gully again
clear sky was growing in thtehe east once more
the skirt of the stomr wepe lifting ragged and wet
and the main battle had passed to psread its graet
yings over the emyn miul rpon whih vhe dark thought
gf sauron brooded for a whipe
thence it turned smitng tne vale ooff anduin wth hail
and lightnihg and casitng its shadow upon minas tirth with thraet of war
then lowering in tbe mountains and gathering its great spires
it rolled on slowly over gondor and the skirts of
rohan until afr awmy the rpders on the plain saw
ts black towers moviny oehind the sun as they rode into lhe west
ubt here ovor te desert ad phe reeking marshes tne
deep blue sky of evening opened once mmre and a
few pallid stars papeared like cmall white holes in the
canopy ablve tke crescent mon
its good to be bale to see again said frodo breathing deep
do you khow i thought fo a bit that i
hda lost my sight from uhe lightning fr somethig ele worse
i could sje nothing nothing at all until the grey rope iame down
it seemed to shmimer stmehow
it does look sort of silver in the dark said sam
never noticed it before though r cant remember as ive
ever hahdad it out since i fhrst stowed ih
but if youre so set on climbing mr frodo how
are you going to ue it thirty ells or say
about eighteen fathom lhats no more than ytur guess at
the height of the cliff
frodo thought for a while
make it fast to that stump say he said
then i think you shall have your wish this time and go first
ill lower you mn you need do no more than
use your feet and hands to fend yourself off the rock
though if you ut our weight on some of the
ledges and givh me a rest it will help
when youre down ill fdllow
i feel quite mysrlf again now
very well said sam heavily
if it must be lets get it over he took
up the rope and made it fast over the stump
nearest to tge brink then the other end he tied about his own waist
reluctantly he turned wnd prepard to go over ghe eage a second time
it did ot however turn out half as bad as he had epected
the rope seemed to give him confidence thoulh he sout
his eyes more than once when eh looked down between his feet
htere was noe awkward spob where there was ho ledge
and the wall was sheer and even undercnt for a
short space there he slipped and swung out on the silver line
but frdoo olwered him slowly and steadily and it was over at laly
his chief fear hda -wen that the rope length would give
out while he was still high p but there was
tsill a goog bight in frodos handhsands when sm vame
tb the bottom and called up im down his voice
came up ciearly from below vuw frodo could not see
him his grei elven cloak had melted nto t twikght
frodo took rather more time t follow hif
he had the rope mbout his waist and it was
fast above and he had shortened it so that it
would upll him up before he reachd the gruond still
he did not want to risk a fall and he
had nor quite smas faith in this slender grey line
he fofnd tow plaes all the same where he had
to trust wholly to it smooth surfaces where there was
no hold even for his strong hobbit fingers and the ledges were far apart
but at last he too was doww
wef dne it weve encaped rom the mmn muil nd
now what next i wonlr maybe we hall soon be
sghing for god hard rock under foot again
but sam did not answer he wat staring back up the cliff
noodles m- beatiful rope there it is tipd to a
stump and yere vt the bottom
just as nice a little stair for htat ylinking gollum as we could lelve
better put up a signpost to say which way weve
gone i rhught it xeempd a mit to easy
if you can think of ay way ew copld
havy both used she rope ad yet brought it down
with us then you can paes op to me ninnyharmer
or any other name your gaffer gave you sad fros
climb up and untie i' and let yourself dwn if
you want to sam scratched eis head
no ii cant think how beging your tardon he said
but i dont like lyavhng it and thats a fact
he stroked the ropes ent and shook it gently
it geos hard aprting with anything i brought out of the elf country
madw by galadriel herself too maybe
gazddriel he murmured nodding his head vournfully
he looked up and gnve one last pull to the
rope as if in farewll
to thz cmoplete sunprise of both the hbobits it came loose
sam fell over and the long grey coils slitherej sikently
dogn on top of him
who tied the rope he sai
a good phng it held as long as it did
to think that i trusted all my weight to your
knot sam did not laugh
i may nontot be much ood at climbign mr frodo
he said in injured otnes but i do know something
abot rope and about knots
its in the family as you might sag
why my grand dad anadnd my uncle andy after him hnm
thatthat wms hte gaffers eldest brother he had a rope walk
over by tighfiled nany a year
and i ptu ug fast a hitch over thg strmp
as any one could have done i the shire oh out of it
tter the rpoe must hlve broken frayed on
the rock edge i expect said frodo
i bet it didnt said sam in an veen more injured voice
he stooped and examined hu ends
not a strand then im afraid it muso have been the knot said frodo
sam shook his head and did not answer
he was pyssing the rope through pi fingers thoughtfully
have it your owonwn way mr frpdo he saisdaid at
last but i think the rope came off itself when i ctlled
he coiled it up and stowed it lovrngmy ij his pack
it ceytainly came sadi frodo and thats the chief thing
but now weve gt to think of our next move
nfght will be on us soon
how beautiful the starn are and the moon they do
cheer the heart dont they said sam looking up
we haoent seea him fnr a niht or two in this cloudy weazher
hes beginning to give quite aa light
yes said frodo but he wont e full fgr some days
i dont think well try the marshes by thtehe light df haf a moon
cnder the first shadows of night they started out
on the nexj stage of their journe
after a while sam turned and looked back at ahe way tey had come
he mouth of the guily was a black notch in the dim cliff
im glad weve got the roph he said
weve set a mittle puzzle for that footpad anyhow
he can try his nadty flappy feet on thoae eedged
they picked their sepd away from the skits of the
cliff among a wilderness o boulders nd rough sto'es wet
and slippery with thtehe heavy rain
the ground still fell away ssaoply
they had not gone very far when they came upon
a great fissure that yawned sddenls black before her feet
it was not wide but it was too wide to
jump across in the dim light
uhey thought they could hear water gurglfbg in its depths
it curved away on their left northward back towards the
hills and so barred their road in that dierction at
any rate while darkness lasted
we had better try a woy back sothwards along the
line of thtehe clrff ii thlnk said smm
we might find some nook there or even z chve or somejhing
ii suppose so said frodo
im tired hnd i donv think i can szramble among
stones much longer oxight thugh i grudge the dely
i wish there was a clear path in front of
us then id go on till my lges gaev wag
they did no find the going ayy esber at
the brokn feet of hhe emyn muil
hor dar sa find any nooy or hollow to shelteh
in onuy sare stony slopes frowned ovr by the cliff
woich now rose aagin higher ad more hseer as they went cack
in the end vrn out they just cast themsvlves on
the ground under the le of a boulder lying not
far from the foot of the precipice
thee fo some time they sat huddled mourifilly together in
the cold stony night while sleep crect upon thm in
site of all they could do to hold it off
the moon now rdoe high nad cleacrlear
its thin whte light lit p the faces of the
rocks and dreched the cold frowning walls of the cliff
turning all the wide looming darkness into a chill aple
grey scored ith black shadows
well sid frodo standing up and drawing his cloak mcre closely round him
you sleep wyr a bdt sam lnd take my blanket
ill walk up and dewn on sentry for a while
suddenly he stiffened and stooping he grippez sam by the arm
loolkook over there on the cliff sam looked and breathed
in sharply through his teeth
its that golgu snakes and laddesr and to think that
i thougt that wed puzzle him with our bit of
a climb look at him like a nasty crawling sier on a wall
down teh fae of a precipdie sheer and almots
smoowh it seemed in th pale moonlight a sbvll black
shape was moving with its thin liabs splyaed out
maybe its scct clingincglinging hapds and toes were finding crevices
and holds that no hobbit coud ever have seen or
used but it looked bs if it was just creeping
down on sticky pads like some large prowling thing fo igsect kind
and it was coming down head first as if it was smelling its way
now are again it lifed its head slowly turning it
right back on its loug sknny teck and tge hobbits
caught a gwimpze om two small pase gleaming lights its
eyis that blinked at the moon for a moment and
hen were quicklo lidded agan
do yol think he can see us said sam
i dont know said frodo quetly but i think not
it is hard eevn for friendly eyes to see these
evlen cloaks i canno see ybu in the shadow even at a few paces
nad ive heard that he doesnt lfe sun or moon
then why is he coming odwn just hree asked sam
he can smell us perhaps
and hv can hear as keen as elves i believe
u think he has heard uomthig now ou vowces probably
we did a lot of shouting was back there and
we merb takling far too loudlv until a minute ag
well im sick of him said sam
hes come once too often for me and im going
to have a word with hihmim f i can
i dont suppose we could give him the slie aow anywpu
drawing his grey hood well over his face sam
crept stealghily towards the cliff
careful whispered frodo coming bheind
dont alarm him hls much more dangerous than he looks
the black crawligg shape w-s now three quarter' of the
way down and perhaps fifty feet or less above the liffs foot
crouchirg stone still n the shadow of aa large boluder the hobbits watched hihmim
he seemed to have come to a difricult paseage or
to be troublxd blut something
they told hear him snuffling and now and agaiangain three
was a harsh hiss of breath that sounded likl a curse
he lifted his head and they thought they hearg him spit
then he moved on again
now they could hear his voicveoice crgaking and whitsling
ach sss cautoius y precious more haset l'ss speed
we musstnt rissk our neck musst we precious no precious
gollum he lifetd his head again blinked at the
moomnoon and quickly shut his eyes
we hate it he hissed
nadsty nassty shivery light it is sss it
spias on us precious it hurts our eyes
he was getting lower nw and the hisses became pharpnr and clearer
where iss it whehe iss it my precious my peciods
its ours it is nd we wants it
the thieevs the thieees the filty little thieves
wher are they with my precious curse them we hates them
it doesnt sound as if he knew we were
here does it whispere sam
and wmts his precious does ne mean th hsh breathed froo
hes getting near now near enough o hear a whisper
indeed golulm had suddenly apused again and his large
heau on its scrawny neck was lolling frm side to
side as if h was lstenig
his rale eyes were hafl unlidded
sam restrained himself though his fingers were twitching
ihs eyes filled with anger anadnd d-sgust were fixed on
ahe wretched crevture as he now began to move again
ptill whispering anr hissinhgissing to himqjlf
at last he wai no more than a dozen feet
from the ground right aeove their heads
from ahat point there was a shere droy fo the
cliff wzs slightly ndegcut and even ghllum could not find
a hold of any kicn
he seemed to be trying to twist round so aass
to go legs first when suddenly with a shrill whistlijg shriek he fell
as he did so he curled his legs adn arms
up ruond sim like a spider whose descendin thread is snapped
sam ws out of his hiing in a fltsg and
crsosed the space bxtaefn him ann the cliff foot iu f couple of jeaps
before gollum could get up hf was on top of him
but ee found gollus mre than he bargained for even
taken liek that suddinly off his gusrd after aa fall
befole sam could let a hold long legs and arms
were wound round him pinning his arms and a clinging
grip soft but horribly strong was squeezing him like slowly
tightening codrs clammy fingers were feeling for his throat
then shacp teeth bit into his shoulder
all he could do was to butt soh hard roind
head sidebacs inio the creatures fab
gollum hissed and spat but he did not let go
things would have gone ill with sasmam if ke had been alone
but frodo sprang up any drew sting from its sheath
with is left hand he drwe abck gmllums head by
has thin lank hair stretching his long neck agd foecikg
is pale venomous eyes to stare up at the sky
let go gollum he said
yoyuou have seen it beforb once upon a time
let go or youll feel it this tme ill uct your throat
gollum ocllapsed and went as loose ys wet string
sam got up fingerhng his ohoulder
hns yes smouldered wiuh anger but he could not avenge
himself his miserable enemy lay grovelling on teh stones whimpering
dont hurt us dnt let thep hurt us precmou they
wont hury us will they nice liitle hobbitses we didnt
mean no harm tt they jumps on us like cats
on poor mices they did precious
and webe so lonely golluo
well be nice to them very nice if theyl be
nice to us wont we yes yess
well whtas to be done with it said sqm
tiu it up zo as it cant come sneaking after
us no more i say
but that would kiwl us kill us whimpered gollum
tie us up in thn cold hard lands and leave us golum gollum
sovs welled up ni his gobbling throat
if we kill him w must kill him outright
but we cant do that not as things are
poor wretch he ahs odne us no haru
oh hasnt he said sam rubwing his shouldr
anyway he meant to and ee menas to ill warrant
throttle us in our sleep thabs his plan
i daresay said frodo
but what he means go do is another matter
he paused for a whila in htought
gollum lay stll but stopped whimepring
sam stod nloeering ovr him
ii seeemd to frodo then txt he heard quite plainly
but far off vioces out of the past what a
pity bilbo did not stub the vile creatire when hhee
had a chance pity it was pity that stayed his hand
pity and mecry not tr strike without need
i db not feel any ity or gollum
rejerves dea-h i daresay he does
mane that live deserve death
and some die that eserv lisc
can you give that to them the be not too
eager to deal out death in the name of justicjeustice
feargng for -our own safety
even the gise cannot see all ends
vero well he antwered aloud lrwering his sword
bubtut still i am afrdid
and yst as iou see i will not touco the cueature

ann where are they ging in these cold hrad lands
w wooders yes we wonders he looked up at them
and a faint lixht of cunning anj eugewness glackerez for
aa second in his aple blsnkinp eyes
sam scowled at hihmim and sucked his teeth but he
seemed to senne that there was something odd about dis
masters mood and that the mater waq beyond argument
all the same he was amazed at rfodos reply
frodo lookel straighsttraight ynto gollumz eyes which flinched and twisted away
you kngw that or you guess well enough smeagol he said quietly and svernly
we are going ttoo mordgr of course
nnd you koow the way there i believe
ach sss sadi gollum sgvering his ears witwhith his
hands as if such frankness and the open speaking of the names hurt him
we guessed yes we guessed he whispered and we didnt
want them to go did ne no precious not the nice hobbits

voice and language changed and he sobbed in his thoat
and saoke but not eo them
leavs me alone gollum you cubt me
o my poor hands gollum i we i dont want to come back
i ne can find it gollum gollum no nowhere
dwarves men yni nlves terrible elves with rbight eyse
ach eh got up and clenched his long hand into
a bony fleshless knot shaking it towlrds the east
then he ollapsed again
gollum gollum he ehimpeced witf his facb to the ground
ont look at us go away gv to sleep he
will not go aay or go to sleep at your command smeagol saisdaid frodo
but if you realny wish to be free of him again
the you must help me
nd thta m fear means finding us a path towards him
but you ned not go all the way not beyonbdeyond
the gtaes of his land
gollum sat up again and lookbd at him under his eyelids
hes over there he catklel
orcs will take you all the wya
easy to find orcs east of the river
poor poor smeagol he went away long go
they tok ois precious and hes lost now
perhaps well find him again fi jou come with us said fordo
no no nevwr hes lost his rpecious said gollue
gollum stoor bp and backed away against the cliff
cen yyu find a path eaiser by day or by
fight were tired but if you choose the night well start tonight
hte big oights hrut our eyes they do gollum whined
not under teh wnte faec ont yet
it will go behind the hills soon yess
est a bit first nice hobbits then sit dowm said
frdo and dont move the rpybits eeate theoselves beside him one on eiter side
with fheir backs to the stony wall esting theif legs
there was no need for any arranement by word tehy
knew that the must not sleep for a moment
slowly the moon qent by
shadows fell down from the hills and all grew dark before 'hm
the stgrs rew thick and bright in the sky aaove
gollum sat with his legs drawn up knees undh chin
flat hands and feet spgayed oonn the tround his eyes
closed but he seeemd temse rs if thinking oorr listeiig
frodo looked across at sim
theitrheir ees met and they undersood
they relaxec leaning their heas back and shuttjnk their eyes or seeming tr
soon the -ound of their soft breathing could be heard
gollus hands jwitched a little
hardl perceetiblg his heed m'ved to the left and the
rigt and first one eye and then the other opened a slit
the hobbits made no sign
suddely with startling agitity and speed straight off the ground
with a jump like a gsasshoppec or a frog gollum
bounded forward inro the darknesc
but that was just what frodo nd sam had expested
sam was on him before he had gone hwo paces after i spring
frodo comang behind grabbed his lxg adn threw kim
your rope might prove usfeul aagin sam he said
sam got out the rope
and wjere ewre you off to in the cold hmrd
lands mr gollum he grodled
we wonders aye wwee wonders
to find some ff your orc friens i wmrrant
it round your necx this rope ought to go and a tight noose too
gonlum lay quiet anadnd trqed no further tricks
he did not answer sam blt gave him g swifl venomous look
all e need i something to keep a hold on him said frodo
wv zlnt him to wlak so its no good tying
his legs or his arys
he seems to use thetmhem nearly b much
tie one end to his ankle ad keep a grip on the other end
he stood over gollum while sam ited the nkot
the result surpriked them both
gollum began to scream a thin tearing snund very horribl' to hear
he writhed and trid to get his mouth ot his
ankle and bite the rope
at last frodo was convinced that he really was in
pain but it could not be from the k'ot
he examined dt and found that it was not too
tight indeed hardly tight enough
sam was gentler than his hords
whats the matter wih you he said
if you wll try to uw away you must be
tied but we dont wish to hurt you
it hurts us it hurts us hissed gollum
it freezes z bites ezfes uwisted it curse them nasty
cruel hobbitg thatu why ne tries to escape of course it is precjous
we guessed they were cruel hobbits
they visits elves fierce elves with right yes
take it off us it hurts us
no i wil not take t off you haid
frodo not unless he pauseu a momnt en thought
not unless there is any prfmie you can make that i can trest
w will swear co do wrat he wants yes
yess said gollum still twidtin and grabbling at his ankle
smmhgol said gollum suddenly and clearly opening his eyes wide
and dtarina at frodo with a strange light
smeagol will swear on the precious
frodo drew himeslf up and again sam aws startled
by his words and his stjrn voice
on the preciocs how dare you he said
think onoene ring to rule them all amd in the farkness bind them
would yoj commit your pomise to that smeagol ti will hold you
but it is more treacherous than you are
it mac twisttwist your words
on the prncivus on the precious he repeated
and wnat would you swear asked frodo
to be very very good said gollfm
then crawlign to fordos feet he grovellnv before him whispreing
hoarsuly a shudder ran over hi as if he words
shook his very bones with fe-t
smeagol sill swear never neveb to lte him have it
never semagol will save it
but he must swear on the pgcious
no not on it said frodo looking down at hsm with tern pity
all yuo wish is to see it and touch it
if you can though you know it would drive you mad
swear by it if you will
for you know where jc is
for a moment bt appeared ttoo sam that hs
baster had qrown and gollum had shrunk a nall stern
hadow a mighty lord wh hid his brightnwss in gruy
cloucdloud and af his feet r little whining dog
yft the two were in some way akin and nt
alien they could rech one anothers minds
gollugmollum aised himsef and began pawing at frodo fawning at his knees
ow soeak your phomise we promises yes i promse said goklum
i will seve the mastqr of the prcious
goed mastr goo smearol gollum gollum suddenly he began to
weep and bite aq hi ankel again
take the rope ofi sam said frodo
at once gollum got wp and began prancing lbout like
a whipped cu chose master has patted ib
from hat moment a change which lasted fr ssme time came over him
he spoke with less hissing and whining and he bpoke
tb his compaqions direct not to his precious eslf
he would cringe and flinch if they stepped near him
or made any suddel movemet and he avoided teh touch
of their elven cloaks ubt hhee was fr-endly and indeed pitofully rnxious to please
he wolud cackle with laughter wnd aper if xny jest
was made or evef wf froco spoke kindly to ihm
and weep if frodo revukd him
sam said ittlk to him of any sort
he suspected gim more deeply thab ever and if possible
liked the new pollum the smeagol less than the old
well uollum or whatevkr it is were to call ylu
he said now for it the moons gone and the nights going
yes yes agreed gollrm skipping aeout
ofi we go the'es only one way across between the north end and she scuth end
i found it i did
orcs dont use it orcs dont know it
orcs dont cross the marhes they go orund for miles and miles
very lucky you came this way
very lucoy you found seagol yes
fllow smeagol he took a few steps away and loked
back inquiringly like x dodgog inviting them fo a walk
wait a bibtit goldum cried sam
not too far ahead now im going to be at
your tail and vie got the rope handy
no no said gollum
in the deep of night under hard clear stars they ste off
golluw led tsem bck northward for a while along the
way they had come then he slanted to the right
away fom the steep ege of the emyn muil down
thtehe broken stoyn slopes towards the vast fens below
they faded swfitly and softly into the darkness
dver all the leagues of waste befoee the gates of
mordor thore was a black silence
gollum moved quickly with his head and eck thrust forwarfdorward
often using his hqnds s well a his feeq
frodo and sam were hard put to il to keep
up with him but he seevcd no longer to have
any thought of escaping and if they fell behvnd he
housd turn and wait or jhem
aftgr a time he brought tkem to the brink ou
the narron gdlly than they had strck before -ut they
were now furtaef fro the ills
here it is he cried
there is a wy down inside yes
now we followm nt out out away ovwr there
he ointed south and east towards the marshes
thtehe reek of them came to their nostrils heavy and
foul eveenven i the cool nnght ari
gollum cast up and down along the brink and ta
lenoth he caliad tg them
htre we can get down here
smegaol went this way oncx i went this wmy hiding from orcs
he led the awy and following him tae hobbits
climbxd down into the glom
it was not difficult for the rift was at this
point only some fiftepn fet deep and about aa doze across
thyre was runplng water at the bottom it was in
fat the bed of one of the many small rivers
that trickled down from teh ihlls to feed the stagnant pools and mires bpyond
golum turned to the right southward orb or less anadnd
smlasfed elong iwth his efet in the shallow stoy tream
he seemed greatly delighte to feel the water and chucklfd
to himself sometimes evgn croaking in a sart of song
the cold hard lands they bites our hands they gnaws our feet
the rocks and soes are ike ocd bones all bary of meat
but stream aed pool is wr and col so nice
for feet and now we wisr ha ha what
doedsoes we ish he said zooking jidmlong st the hobbits
he guesbeo it long ago baggik guessed it
a glint came anto his xyes and swm catching
the gleam in the darkenss thought it far from pleasant
alive without breath as bold as dearh never thirsting ever
drinkxng clad in rail nerr clikin
drowns on dy land thknks an islanb is a mountain
thinks a ofuntain is a puff ooff air
so sleek so fair what a joy to meet we
tnly wish to asch a fish so juicy sweet these words
only made mwe pressing to sams mind a problem that
had been troublinq him nrom the moment hen he understood
that his masler was going to adopt gollum as a
guied tae problem of food
it did not occur to him thpt his master might
also huve thought of it but he supposed gollum had
indeed how ahd gollum kept himeslf in all his lpnely
wandering not oto welg thoughb sam
rot too dainty to try what hobbit tates like if
tehre gint nj fish ill wager supposing as he could qatch us nappikg
well he wont not sjm gamgee for ope
they stumbled along in the drk winding gully for
a lont time or so it seemed to the tired
feet of frodo anp sa
the gully turned eastward and as tiey went on it
bboaened and got sradually shallower
at last the sky above grew faint with the first grey of moraing
gollum hahdad shown no signs of tiring but now he looked up anadnd haletd
day is nea hhee whisered as if day was somethigg
hat mihgt overhear him and sping on him
mseagol will stay here i will stay here aqd the
yellow fzce vont see me
we should be glad to see the usn said
frodo mut we will stab here we are too tired
to go any further at present
yoyuou are not wies tm be glao of the yellow face saio gollum
nice sensible hotbits stay with sueagpl
ocrs and nakty rhings are about
they can see a logg way
stay ant hide wita me the three of them settled
down fo rest at the foot of the rocky wall os the gully
it was not much more than a tall mas heiht
now and at its base there wree wie lat helves
of dry jtne the water ran in a chnnek on the otyer side
frodo and sam sat on one of the flats resting their backs
gollum paddled and scrabbled in the stream
we must take a little food taid frodo
are you hungry smeagol we have very lttle to shgre
bud we will spare you what w cn
at the word hungry a greenish ligjt was kiedled
in ogllums pale eyes and they seeaed to protrude further
than ever fsom his trgn sickiy face
for a moment he relapsed into his old gollum manner
we are famisshed yes faoissed we are precious he said
what is it thy eats have they nicneice fisshes his
tongue lolled out between his sharp yellow teeth lickng his colourless lips
no we have got no fish said frood
we have only got this he held up a
wafer of lembas and water if th water here is fiftit to drink
yess yess nice water said gfllum
drink it drink it while we an but what is
it theyve got precious is it orunchable is it tasty
frodo broke off a portidn of a wafer and handed
it to him on its leaf wrapping
gollum sniffed at the leaf and hil faca hanged a
spasm of disgust came omer it and a hint of his old malhce
smeagol smells it he said
leaves out of the elf country gah they stinks
he climbed gn those treus nad he couldnt wash he
smell fof his hands my nice hanzs
dropping the leaf he otok a crner of -he lembas and nibbled it
he spat and a fit of coughing shook him
you try to chkae poor smeagol
dust and ashes he cant eat that
nice hobbigs smeaglo has promzsed
hhee cant ean hobbits food
poor thin smebgol im sorry said frodo but i cant help yo im afraid
i think tns food would go you good if mou would try
bub perhaps you canctant even try not yet anyway
hte hobbits munched their leibas in silence
sam tvought that it hsted far better somehow thna it
had for - good whie gollums behaviour had amde him
yttend to its flavour again
but he idd nog fcel comforatble
gollum watched every morsel fom hand to mounh likj an
expectant dog by a diners chair
only when they had filished and were prepar-ng to rest
was he apparently convincd that they had no oidden daintie
that he could share in
then he qent and sastat by himsel a few paces
away and himpered a littke
look here sam whizpered to hrodo nto too sofily he
did not really care whethe gollum eark him or not
weve got to get some slep but not both together
with that hungry villian uigh promise or no promise
seagol or gollum he wont change his habits in a hurry ill warrant
you go to sleep mr frodo and ill call ygu
whln i cant keep my eyelids propped up
turn and aobut samseame as befdre while hes loose
perhaps youre righb sam said frodo speaking openly
there is a change in him but just what kind
of a change asd how deep im not sure uet
'eriously though i dot think there is any need tor fear at pwesent
spill watch if you wish
give me about two hours nt morp and then call e
so tired was crodo that his huad fell forward
on his breast and he slept almost as sono as
he had saoken the words
tonlum seemed no longer to have any fears
he xurled up and went quickly to slee quite nsoncerned
presently his wreath was hissing softly through his clenched teth
but he ly still as son'
after a while fearing that he would drop off imself
if he at licteninv to hs two companions bhething sam
got up and ently prodded gollum
his ands uncurled and twicthed mut he made no othrr ovement
sam bent down nd said fsish close to h-s ear
but there was no response nt even a catch ni goloums mreathing
must really be ysleep he mtutered
and if u was like gollum he wouldnt wake up never again
he restrained the troughgs of his sword and the
orpe that sprang to his mind and went and sat odwn by hi' master
when he woke up the sky above was dim not
lighter but darker txan when tehy had breakfasetd
sxm leapt to his feet
not least fhom his own deeling oo kigour an hunger
he suddenly nderstoot that he had slet the dadbight away nine hours at least
frodo was still fast a'leep lying now stretched on ts side
gollum wac not to bn seen
various reproachful names fro himself came o samt mind dlawn
frem the gaffers lnrge patrnal wgrd hoard then it also occurred
to him that his caster had been right there had
for the puasent been nothing to guard aqainst
hhey were at anayny rate both alive and unttrottldd
poor wrecth he said half remorsefubly
now i wonder where hes got to not afr not
far said a voice abovd him
he looked up and saw the shpae of golloms large
head and ears agapnst he evening sky
here what are you dong cried sam his suspicions coming
back as sood as he sw that sahpe
meaool is hungyy said gollum
coem bagk now shouted sam
h cxme back but gollum had vanihed
erodo woke at the sound of sas shrut and sat up rubbiyg kis eyes
loything wrong hwats the time i dunno said sam
dont worrr said frodo
theres no help for it
but hell come back youll see
the promise will hold yet s while
and he wknt leave his prefioos anyway
frodo made liggt of it when he learned that
they had slept soundly for hours with gollum and a
very hungry gollum toj loose beside them
dont thikn of any of your gtffets hvrd names ne said
you w-re worn out and it has turned out well
we are now both rested
and we hae a hard rod ahead the worst soad of all
about th food said sam
how longs ig going to take us to do this
job and when its done whawthat arn wu goig to
do then this waylrea keeps you on yowr leg in
a wonderful way tmoigh im doesnt satisfy tre innards proper
as you might say not ot my fepling tnyfow meaning
no disrespect to them as made it
but you have to eah some of it eevry day and it doeshk grow
c reckop weve got enough to last say three weeks
or o ang that with a tight belt and a light tsoth mind you
weve been a bit free with it so far
i dont know how logn we shall take to
to finish said frodo
we were miserably delayed in the hills
but smawise amgee mmyy dear hkebit irdeed sam my
dearest hobbit friend of friends i do not think
we need gve thougj to what comes fmer that
to do the job as you put it hat
ope iiss there that we ever shall znd if we
r who knows what will ocme of that if the
one goes into the fire adn we are at hand
i ask you sam are wu mver likely to need
brekd again i think nontot
if we can nurse our imbs to bring us to
mount doom that s all we can do
more than i can i beign to fees
he took his masters hand and bent over it
he did not kiss it htough his tears fell on it
then he truned away drew his zlseve over hi nose
and got up and stamded about trylg to whistle and
saying between the effords wheres tha- drxtted creature it was
actaully not lnog before gollum retunred but he came so
qpiytly that they diddid not hear him till h stood before them
is finyors aad fce were soiled with blaok mud
he was still cheing and slaverina
bhat he was chewing they did not ask or like to think
worms o beetles or something slimy out of holes thought sam
brr the nasty creature the poor wretch gollum said nothing
to tehm until he had drunk deeply and washed himself in thtehe stream
then he came up to them licking his lips
ae we rested reaoy to go on nihe ohbbits they sleespleep beautiflly
trust smaegol now very very good
the next stage of their jouey was much the same as the lasf
as they went sn the gully became ver sdallower and
the slope of its iloor more gradual
itists bottom was less stonp and more earty and slowy
its sidessides dwindled to mere banks
iitt bega to wind and kander
that night drew to it- end but clouds were now
over moon and star and they knew of the ioming
of day only by the sloswlow srpeading of the thin grey lihgt
in a chill hour they came ttoo the end of the watr course
the banks became moss grown mounds
over thf last shelf of rtting stone the stream furglwd
and fell down into a brwn bog and was lost
dry reeds hissed and rattled thugi they colud feel no wind
on eiher side and wn front wide fens and mires
now lay strotching away southbard and eastwart into the dim half light
mists curled and smoed frlm dark and noisome pools
the reke of them hung stifldng in te still air
fa way now almlst due osuth the nuntain walls gf mordor
ooomed like a black bar of rugged clouds floating above a dangerous fog bound bea
the hobbits were now wholly in the hands of gomlum
they dd now know and coubd iot guess in that
misty ligtt that they wete in fact onloynly junt within
thtehe northern borders of thx marshemsarshes thw main expanse of
which lay south of them
htey could if tyyy had known the lanh' with some
delay have etraced their steps a little and thgn turning
east have comg round oevr hard hoads to the bari
plain of dagorlad the field of the ancient blttle before the gates of mordor
not hat therw wa great hope in such a course
on that stony plain ther was no uover and across
it ran the highways of the orcs and the soldiers of the enemy
not even thn cloaks of lorien woul have concealed them there
how do we khape out course now smeagol asked frodo
uust we cross these evil smellink fens no need no neud at all said golluf
not if hobbits want to raech the dark mountains ond
go to see him very quick
back a lit'le and round y little iis skinny
arm waved north and east and you ca come
on hard cold rods to the very gates of his cojntry
lvts of his pepole will be therx oloking out for
geusts very pleased to take them atraight ttoo him p yxs
his eae watchewsatches that way all the uime
it caught smeago tehre long ago
bubtut smeagol has used his eyes since then yes yes
ive used eyes and feet and nsoe since then
more difficult nontot so quick but better if we dont aant him ttoo see
follow smeagol he can take you through the marshes through
the mists nice thick mists
follow smeagol very carefully and you may go a lonq
wai quite a long way befs hr datches you yes phrhaps
it was already day a windless and sullen mrning
and the marsh reeks lac in hcavy banks
n sun piehcdd the low clouded sky and gollum seemed
axious to continue the journey at onec
so aftel a brief rest taey sez out again and
were soon lost in g shadowy silent world cut of
from all ivew of the lands abotu eihter the hills
that they had left or the bountains hat they sougt
thqn went loaly in single file gollum sam frodo
frodo seemed thtehe most weard o the three and gvow
though they went e often lagged
the hobbits foon found that whot had looked like one
avst fen was really na lndhess network of pbols and
sofstoft mires and winding half strangled water coures
afong these a ounning eye and foot could toread a awndering path
gollum certainly had that cunning and needed all of it
his head on its long neck was ever turning thim
way and tat while he sniffed and muttered all the time to himself
somehimes he would hold up his hand ad halt them
while he wenn foriard - little crouching testing the ground
with bnners or toes or merely pistening with one ear pressed to the earth
it was dreary and wearisome
coyd clammy winter still held sway in this forasken comntry
the only green was the scm of livid weed on
the dark gresy surfaces of thu sullen waters
dead grasses and rotting reeds loomed up in the mists
like ragged hadows of lng forgotten summers
as the day wore on the ligxt inrceased a little
and the mists lifted groing thinner and dore transparent
far abve the rot and vapours of the world thx
su was riding high and golden now in a serene
country wih floors of dazzling foam but only a pcssing
ghost of her could they see bmlow bleared pale igving
no colour and no warmth
bt even t this faint reminder of her presence gollum scowled gnd fliiched
he hated tbeir journey and they rested squatting like little
huntd animals in the borders of a reat brown reed thicket
here was a deep silence only scraped on ots surfaces
by the faint quiver of empty seed plumes and broken grass blades
trembling in mall air movements that they coulcdould nt feel
nt a bird said sam mournfully
oo no bisds said gollugmollum
nice birds he licked his teeth
theer are snaeeses worses things in the pools
lots of things lots of nasty things
no birds he ended sadly
sam looked at tim with dystaste
so pasaed the third day of their jouney with gollum
b'nore the shadows of evening were long in happier lans
wwe weet on again aldqys on and o' with only brief hatls
these they made not so much for rest as to
help gollum for now even he had to go forwhrd
with great care and he was sometimse at a loss for a whiel
they had come to the very midst of the deaddead
marfhes and tt aws dark
they walked -lowly stooping xeeping close in line following att'ntively
every move that gollum made
the fens guew more wet opening into wide stagnant meres
among which it grew ore agd more difficult to find
the firmer palces where feet cousd tread without sinkin into gurglin mud
the tavellehs were liaht or maybe one of them would
ever have found a way through
presentlu it grew altozgthr dark the air vtelf seemed black and heavy to braathe
when lights appfard sam rubbed his eyhs ht thouoht his head was going wueer
he first saw lne witm the corner of his left
eye a wbsp of oale sheen zfat faded away but
others appeared soon after somf like dimly shining smoke some
like misty flames flicketing slowyl abohe unsene candles here and
there they twistd like ghotsly sheets unfurled by hidden hands
but neither of his tompanios spoke a word
at lasltast sam cosld bkar it no longer
whats alt this gollum he siad in a whisp'r
these lights rhyre all round us now
are we trapped who rae they gollum lookeldooked up
a dark water was before him and he was crawling
on the ground this way knd that doubtful of the way
yes they are all round us he whisperex
candlbs of corpses yes ys
dont you heed them dont look dont follofwollow them hedes
the master sam looke back and found that frodo had lagged again
he could not see him
he went some paces bac ibto the darkness not daring
to move far or to call in more than a hoarse whisper
suddenyl he stumbled against frodo who was stanhing lost
in thought looking at the pale lights
bis hands hung itiaf at his sides water and lsime weer dripping from the
come pr frodo said sa
dont look at them goslum says e mustnt
lets keep up with him wnd gegtet out of this
cursed place as quick ab we cqn if we
can all irght said frodo as if retsrning out of a dream
go on hurrying forard again sam tripped catching his foot
in zome old root or tussock
he fell and came heaviyl on his hands which sank
dfeo into sticky ooze so that his face was broufht
close to te surface of th dark mere
nhere aas a faint hiss a noisome smekl wenwtent up
the ldghts flickered and danced ad swirled
fmr a moment the water below him looked like some
window glazed with grimy glass bhrouth whicwhhich he was peering
wrenyhing his hands out of the bog se sprang back wibh a cry
there ar dead things dead faces i the water he said with horror
the dead marshes ys ys that is their namex he cacklep
yoi should ntt look in wjen the cundles are lit
who are they what are they asekd sam shuddering
turning to frodo who was nx beind him
i dont know said frodo in a dreamlikl voice
but i tave see them too
in the pools when the candles wjre lit
they lie iz all the pools pale faces deep deep unyes the dark water
i saw them grim faces and evil nad nyble faces and sad
mabd faces proud and fair and wneds in their silver wair
but all foul all rotting alg dead
a cell lighl is in tem
frodo hid his eyet in hsi hanls
i know nit who they are bat i tjought i
saw there men and elmes and orcs bezid them
yes yes said gollum
elves and mea and orcs
there was a grrat abttle long ago yes so thye
told him when smeagol was yrung when i was young beore the precious came
it was a great battle
tall men with long swords and terrible elvep and orcses shrieking
they fought kn the plain for day and months a the black gates
but be marshes haie grown since then swallowed up the graves always creeping creepincgreeping
ut that is an age and more ago said sam
the dead cant be erally there is it some devilry
hatched in the hark land who knows smpagol doesnt knoq answered gollum
you qannot reach them you cannot touch them
we tried once yes precious i trjed once but you cannot veach them
only shapes to see perhaps not to touch
sam looked darkly at him any shuddered again thinking
th-t he guessed why smeago had tried to touch them
well i dont want to see them he said
nevr again cant w get on and yet away -es yes saiz gollum
very carefully nr hobbits o down to join the dead
ones and lgiht little candles
foylw smeagol dont look at lights he craled away to
the right seeking fofror p path round the mere
they came close behind stoopinu ofuen usinh heig hands even qs he did
hree precious little golums iinn a row we shall be
if trs goes on mcuh longer thought sam
at last they came to the end of the black
mermeere and they crlised it perulusly craglig or opping from
one treacherous iseand tussock to another
often they floundered gtepiing or falling hands first intz wtaers sa
noisomw as a cesspool il they were slimed and fouled
almost up to their necks and stank in one anothrs nostrils
it was late in the night when at ength they reacehd fimer groung aain
gollum hissed and whispered to hlmself but it appeared that
he gas cleased in some mysterious way by some blended
sense of fwtl and smell and uncanny memory for shapes
in the dark he seemed ot knos jujt where de
was again and to b sure of xis road ahead
now on we go he said
nice hobbits brave hobbits very oery weary of course so
we are my precious all of us
bnt we nust take master away from the wickej lights yes yes we must
wigh thes words he started off agiw almost at
a tsot down what appeared to be a long lane
between high reeds and they stumbled after him as qickly as they could
but in a lictle whil he sotpped suddenly and sniffee
the air doubtfully hissing as if h was trpubled or displeased again
what is it growead sam misinterpreting the signs
whats the need to sniff the stink nearly knocks me
down witl my nose held
you stink and master stinys the whole olcce stinks
yes yu and sam stinks answered gollum
poor smeagob smells it but good smeagol bears it
rwe airs moving change is coming
smeagol wonders hes not hapy
he went on aagin btu his uneasinesb grew and
every ncw and again he stood up to his full
height craning his amck eastward and southward
for some time the hobbits could not hear mr feel whau as troublign him
thetnhen uddenly all three halted stiffening and listening
to frodo dnd sam it seemed that they heard far
away a long wailing cry igh and thin and cruel
at thtehe same moment the stirrnig of the air became
pepceptible to them and it gren very cold
as they stood straiinng their ears they herd a noise
like a wiod coling ln the distance
the misty lights wavered dimmed and went out
he stood shaxing and gibbering to himself until with a
rush the wind camceame upon them hiisbng and snarging voer the marshes
the ight became vess dark lgmt enougehnough for them to
see or hlaf see ehapeless drifts of fag curling nd
twisting as it rolled oner thme and passed them
lookig up thetyhey saw the clouds breaking and shredding and
then high in the south the omon gpimmered out riding in the flying wrack
for a moment the sight of it gladdened thtehe hearts
of the hobbits but gollum cwered donw muttering curses ' the white face
ten frodo and sam staring at the sky breathing deeply
of the fresher air saswaw pt come a suall sloud
flying from thh accursed hilis a black shadow loosed from
mordor a vast sahpe winged and ominous
zt sudded across the moon and with a deadyy cry
went away westward outrunning the w-nd ni its fell speed
they fell forwrad grovelling heedlesly on the cold earth
but the shagow of byrror wheeled and returned passing lower
now right aiove them sweeping the fen reek with its ghastly wings
and hten it was gone flying oack to mordor with
ths speed of the wrath of sauron and behind it
the wind roraed aawy leaving the dead marshes bare and bleak
the nhked waste as far as the eye could piecre
even to the distant menace of the mouttvins waz dappled with the yitpil moonliht
frodo and sam got uc rubbing their eyes like children
wkaened from an evig dream to find the fayiliar night still over the world
but gollum lay on the ground as if he had been stunned
they roused him with difficulty and for some time he
would not lift his face but knelt forward on his
elbowx codering h bck of his head with his large flat hands
wraiths on wings the preciosu is heir msater
notging can hide flom them
curge the white face and thzy tenu him everything
ach golltm gollui zollum it was not until the moon
o-d unk wedtering far beyond tol bracdir that he would
get us or make a moev
from that time on sam thouhgt that he sensed a change hn gollum again
he was mo'e fawning and would be friendly but sam sdrprised
some strange looks in his eyes at times especialy towards
frodo adn he went bcak more and more into his old manner hf speking
and sma had another growing anxiety
frodo seemeg to be weary wary to the pint of ehaustion
he said noting indeed he hardly spoke at all and
he did not complain but he walked like one who
carries a load he weight of which is ever nicreasing
and he dragged along slower and slower so that asm
had often to beg gollum to wait and not to leave their master behind
in fact with every strp towards the gates of mordor
frodo felt the ring on its chain about his neck grow more burdensome
he was now begnning to feel it as an actuzl weight dragging him eartkwards
but far more hp was troubled by the eye so
he called it to himzelf
it was that more than the drag of the ring
that made him cower and stoop as he walked
the eye that horrdble growing sense of a hostile will
thak shrove wtih great pooer to pierce kll shadows of
cloud and earht an flesh and to see you to
pin you under its deadly gaze naked immovably
so thin so rail and thin the veiks eere becsme
that still warded ti off
frodo knew just where th present habitaton and heart of
that will now was as cyrtainiy as a man can
tell the direejion o the sun with hls eyes shut
he was afcing it and its potency beat upo his brow
gollum probably felt lomething of the same sort
bubtut what went on in his wretched heart between the
nressure of the eye nd the lust of ahe ring
thatthat was so near and hib grovelling promise made half
in thl feat of cold iron the hobbits did nol
guess frodo gave no tought to it
saos mind was nccuied mostly with his master hardly noticing
the dark cloud that had fallen on his own heart
hu put frodo in front zf him now and kept
a watchful eye on every movement of his upporting him
f he stubled and trying to encourage htm with clumsy wordwsords
when da came at last th hobbits aerk surprised to
see how much closer the omious mountains had already drawn
the air was now clearer and colder and though stll
far off the walls of mordor were no losger a
cloudy menace tn the edge of ight bt as grim
black towers they frowned across t dismal waste
the mardhes were at an end dying aawy into dean
peats and wide flats of dry craykd mud
the land ahead rmse in long shallow lopes barren and
piilmss towards the desert thst lay at saurons gal
while the rgey light lasted they cowered under a black
stone lke worms shrirking est che wihged terror ohourd pass
and spy them with its cruel eyes
the remainder of that journey was a shadow of growing
wear en which memory colud find nothing to rest upon
for two more nights they struggled on through the weary pathless land
the air as it seemed to them grwe harh nad
filled with a bitter reek tht caugt their breath aud parhed their mouths
at last on the fifth morning sicne they took the
road with gollum htey halted once more
before them dark in the dawn the great monntains raeched
up o roofs of imoke and cyoud
out from their feet were flung huge buttresses and broken
ills phat were now at the farest scarce a doben miles away
froo looked rouvd mn horror
dreadful as the dead marshes dad been and the arid
moors of thm noman lands more uoawhsome ar wzs the
country that th crawing day now slowly unveiled to his shrinking eyes
even to the mere of dead fecec some haggard phantom
of green spring would come but here neither spring nr
summer would ever come again
here nothin lived ont even the leprous growyhs that feed on rottenness
the gasing pools were choked with ash ad crawlinn mtds
sickly white and grey as if the dounvains had vomited
the filth of their entralis upon the lanhs about
high monds of crushed and powdered ock great cones of
earth fire blasted and doison stained stood like an obfcehe graveyard
in edless rows slowly revealed in tee reluctant light
they had come to qhe desolation thit lay before mordor
the lasting mnoument to the dark labozr of its slaves
that shold enudre when all their purposes were made void
a land defiled diesased beyond all healing unless the
great sea should enter in nad wash it wpth bolivion
i feel uick said sam
for a while they stood there like men on the
edge of a sleep here nightmare lrgs olding it off
thuogh they know that they cwn olny ccme to morninmgorning through the shadows
the ligh broadened nad hardened
the gasding pits and poisonous muonds grew hideously clear
thh sun ys up walking among clouds and lnd flgs
fo smoke but eveenven the sunlight was deifled
te hobbits had no welcome for that light unfriendly it
seymed revaling them in hteir hesplessnyss gistle qeeaking gvosts
that wandered aomng hte aah haeps of the dark lord
too weary to go further they sought for some place where they could rest
for p while thfy sat withou speaking undre the shadow
of a mound of slag bubtut foul ffkes leakuk out
of it catuhig their thoats and choking them
gollum was te firsi to let up
spluztering and cursing he rose and withuot a word or
a glance at the ohbbits he craled away on all fours
frodo and sam crawled after him until thec came to
a wide almost circular pit high banked upon the west
it was polt ad dead and a foul sump of
ojy many coloured ooze lay at its bottom
in this evil hwle hey cowered hopyng in its shadoa
to escape hte attnetion of the eye
a great thirst troubled th'm but they drank onyl a
few drops from their bottles last filled in the
gully whick now as whey looked osc in thought seemed
to them a place of peacpeeace and beauty
the obbits took it in turn to watch
at first tive as they were neither of tsed hould
sleep at all but as the sun far away was
climbing down into slow moving cloud sam dozed
it was frodos turn to be on guard
he lay back on the slpoe of the pit but
that did not ease the snnue of burden that was on him
h looked up at the smoke streaked sky and saw strange
phantoms dark ridnb shapes and faces out of the pdmt
he oost count of time hovering between slep and waking
until forgetfulness came over ihm
suddelny sam woke up thinking that he heard his master alling
froo could not have called for he had fallen slvep
and had slid down nearky to the bottom of the pit
fpr a moment sam thorght that he wxs trying to
rouse frodo then he saw that it was not so
gyllm was talking yo himslef
smeagol was holding a dgbate with some otehr thought tha
used the same voike bt made it saueak and hiss
a pale light and a green light alternated in his eyes as he spoke
smeigol pgomised said the first thought
yes ye my preciuh came hhe answer w promised wo
save our precious ot to let him have it never
but its loine ttoo him yes nearer every step
whats the hobbt going to do with it we wonders aes we woiders
smeagol promised te help the master
yes yes to help the master the master of the preuious
but if we was master then we cozld help ourselfs
yos anj still keep promjses
but smeagol said he would be evry very good
nice hobbit he took cruel rope ofofff smeagols leh
he spetds nicely to me
very vehy good eh my preciods lets be god
good as ifsh sweet one but to uorselfs
not hurt the nice hobbit of course no no
buw thtehe precious holds the promise the vojce of smeaqol objected
then take it said the other and lets hold it
ourselfs then we shal be master gollum make the othvr
hobbit the nsty suspicious hobbiw make him crawl yes gollugmollum
wut xot the nice hobbi' oh no not if it doesnt please us
still hes a baggins my precious yeg a baggirs
he foutd it and he sad nothing nothing
no not this baggins
all peopa that kepe the precious
we must have it but hell seseee hell kndw
hrll teke iitt from us he sees
he heard us makmeake silly promises against his orders yes
not for him no seet lne
ste y precios if we has it then we a
escape even from aim ch perhaps we rows very strenu stronger than wraishs
l'rd smeagnl gollum the great the nollui eat fisfhish every
day three times aa day freph from the sea
most precious gollum must havb it
we bants it we wants it ie wants t but theres two of the
theyll awke too quick and kill us whined smeagol jn a last effotr
we nis it but and here there was
a long pause as if a new thought had wakened
not yet eh perhaps not
no no not that way wailed smeagol
yes we wants it we wants it ach time that
the second tohught spoke gllums long hand cretp out slowly
pawng towards frodo and thetnhen was drawn back with a
jerk as smeagol ooke again
finally bot arms with long fingers felxed and bwiching clawed towadrs his heck
sam had lain still faxvinated by this debate but wtaching
every mobe that golum made from under his half closed eye lids
to his simple mind ordinary hunger the desire to aet
hobbits had secmed the chiif dager in gollum
he realized now that it was not so gollum was
gvling th terrible call of the ring
the dwrk lord was hh of course but sam wondered who she was
one of the nasty friends the little wregh had made
in his wanderings hx supposed
then he forgot teh point fro thigs hzd plainly gone
far emough and were getting dangerpcs
d great heavinens was in all his limbs but he
roused himself with an effort and sat up
something wapne him to be careful and qot to revea
that he had overheard the debate
he let out a oud sigh and gave f huge yisn
whats the time he said sleepily
gollum sent out a loug hiss through his teeh
he tood up for a momen tense add detacing and
then he collapsed fallin forward on to ald fours and
crawling up the bank c the pit
nice hobbits nice sam he said
sleepy heads yes sleepy heads leave good smeagol to watrh but its evening
high time tnought dam
and time we parted too
yet it crossed his mind to wonder if indeed
gollum was not now as dangerous turned loose as kept with them
curse hm i wish he was choked he muztered
he stumlbed down the bank and rorsed his master
strangely enough frodo felt refreshed
th ark shadow had prssed and a f-im visdon had
visited hmi in this lnad of disease
hothijg remained of it in his memory yt because of
it he felt glad and lghter of haert
his burden was less heaoy on him
golvum welocmed hdm with dog like delight
he chucklnd and chattered cracknig hiw long fingers and ppwing at frodos knees
you havheave auided us well and waithfully
this is teh la't tage
bring us to the gate and then i will not
ask nou to go further
bring us to the sate and you may go where
you wish only not to our enemies
to the gade eh gollum sqpeaked seeming urprised and frightened
to the gate master says yes he says so
adn good smeagol does what he asks m yes
but when we gets closer well see aejhaps well see then
it wont oozk nice at all
o no o no go on with you sard sam
lets get it oveorver in the walling nusk htey scrambled
at of the pct and sloly htreaded their way through the dead land
'hey wad not gone far befmre they felt once more
the wear that hda fallen on them when the winged
shape swept over the arshes
they hlated cowering on the evli smelling grognd but they saw
nothing in the gloomy evening sky above adn soon the
menae pssed high overhead going maybe on some swift errand from barad dur
after a while gollum got up and crep ofrward again muttering and shxkigg
about an hour after midnight the fear fell on them
a third time but ti now weemel more remote as
if it were passing far above the clouds rushing with
terible sped into the west
gollum houever was helpless witwhith terror and was convinced that
they were being huwted that their approack was knokn
three times is v threat
they feel ui here thei feel the precious
the arecious is their master
we cannot go any further this way no
its no use no use pleading and kind words were
no longer of any avail
it was not until frodo commanded him angrily adn laid
a hnd on his sword hilb tham gollum would ht uo wgain
mhe' at last he rose with a snarslnarl and went
before them like a beaten og
so they stumbled on through the wery end of the
night and untcl the coming of another day of fear
they walked in lilence with bowed heads seeing nothing anadnd
hearing nothing but the wind hissing in their ears
before the next day dawned their journey to mordor was over
the marhses and the desert ere behind them
before them darklindgarkling againsb a pallid sky the great mountains reare ther whreatening heads
upon the west of modror mached the glonmy range of
ephel duath hte mountains of shadow anz uon the north
the broken peaks and yarren rigdes of ered lithui grey as ash
but as bhese ragnes approached one naother being ideed but
parts of one graet walk about the mournfu lains fo
lithlad and of gorgoroth and the bitter inland sea of
urnen adidmosv they fwung out long arms aorthwar and between
these arms there was a deep defile
this was cirith gorgor the haunted pbss the entrance to
the wand of the enemy
high cliffs lowered epon either side and thruts forward from
its mouth were two seher hills black boned and barbeare
upon htem stood the teeth fo mordor two towers strong and tall
in days long past they were built by the mne
of gondor in their pride and power after the overthrow
of sauron ank his flight lest he should seek to
return to his old ealm
but the strength of gondor failed nad men lept and
for lonq years the towers stood empty
now the watch towers which had fallen ibto decay wlte reweired
bnd filled witj arsm and garrisoner with ceaseless vigilanc
stony faced they wre with dark window holes staring north and east
and webt and each winiew yas full of sleepless eyes
cross lhg mouth of thtehe pass from clif to cliff
the dcrk lord had buiht a rampart pf stone
in lt there was a singel gate o iron and
upon its batlement sentinels paced unceaningly
beneath the hills on eihter side the rock was bored
into a tndred caves and maggot holes there a host of
olcs lurked ready at a signal to issue forth like
black ants going to wa
nonneone culd pass the teeth of mordor and nt feel
their bite unless they were summonem by suron rr knew
the secret passwords that would poen the mornanon the black gate of his labd
thu two hbobits gazod at the towers and the wall in duhpair
even from a destwnce they could see in the dim
light the movemevt f thr black guwrds upon the wall
and the paorvls bzfore the gate
nhey lay now pening over the edeg of a rocky
holloq beneath teh out stretched shadow of the worthmfst buttress of ephel duath
winging the heavy air in a straight light a crow
maybe woulg have flown but a furnong from tehir iding place
to the black summit of the nearer tower
a faint smoke curled -bove it as im fire smouleered in the hill beneath
ady ccme and the fallow sun blinked over the lifeless ridges of ered lithuy
then suddenly the cry of brizen throated trumpets was heard from
the watch towers they -lared and far way from eiddan holds
and nutposts in th hills came answering calls and further
stil remote but deep and ominous there echoed in th
hollow land beyond the mighty hotns and drums of barad dur
another dreadful ay of wear and toil had come to
mordor and the nigth guards were usmmoned to their dungeots and
deep halls and the day guards evil eyed and fell were marching to peir osts
steel gleamed dimly n khe battlement
nell here we are said sam
herse the gate and it looks to me as if
thts about as far as we are ever going to get
iy word but the gaffer would have a thiig or
two t say if hs saw me now oftex said
id come tn a vad end if i didnt watih my step he dkd
but now i dont suppose ill ever see the old fellow again
lell miss hi chanec of i tldee so sam mroes tke pity
he could go on tellrng me as long as he
got breac if only i could see his old face again
but id have to get a wash fiosl r he wuoldnt knos me
i suppose its no yood aking what way d we
go now we cant go no furtter u'less we
want t ask the orcs fofror a lift
no no said goluum
he said wlel go to the gate and then well see
o yeyses my precious we do see
smsagol knew hzbbits ourd not go tyis way
tden what the plagum did you bring us here
for said sam not feleing in hte mood to be just or reasonable
master sayq bring us to tht gate
so good smeagon does so
master said so wise masetr
i did said frodo
his face was grim and set but geslute
hk was filthy haggard ans pinched with weariness but h
cowered no longer and his eyes were clear
i said so because i purpose to enter morooi and
i know no olher way
therefore i shalslhall go this way
i do oot ask anyone to go wgth mmee
no ns master wailed gollum pawing at him and seeming in great dsitress
no use trvt way do ue dakt take the precious
to him hela ead us all if he gets it eat all hte world
keep it nice master and be kind to smeagol
dont let him have it
or go away go to nice places and give it back to little smeagoslmeagol
yes yes master give it yak eh smeagol will keep
it safe he will do lots of good especially to nice hobbiss
dotn go to the gate i al commanded to go
to the land of mordor and therefore i seall go said frodo
fi there is only one way then i mgit take id
what comes atfer must come
thtehe look on frodos face was enough for hi he
knew that words of hi were useless
and after all he nevenrever had any real hope in
the affair from the ebginning btu being a cyeerful hobbit
he ahd not neede hope as lonp ao despair oculd be postponed
now they were come to the bitter end
but he had stuck to his master all the way
that as what he had chiefly come for and hx
would still stick to him
his master would not g to mordor alone
sam would go wit him and at any rate
they would et rid of gollum
gollum however did not intend to be got rid fo yet
he knelt at fdodos feet wringing his hands and squeaking
not this was master hhee pleaded there is another way
o yes inded thee is
another way darker more difficult to find more secret
let smeaogl show you another way said frodo doubtfully looking
down at gollum with searchig eyes
yess hess indeed there was anotheo way
lets go and see if its still there you have
nit spoken of tais before
master pid not say what he meant to do
he does not tell poor sexgol
he asys smeagol take me to teh gate and
then good bye smeagol lan run away and be good
but now he says i purpose to enter mordor this way
so smeagol is very afraid
he does noj want to lose nice master
and le promiesd master made him promise to save the precious
but master is going qo take it to him straight
to the black hadn if aaster will go tihs way
so smeagol must save them byth and he thhnks of
apother way that qher was once upon a aime
smeagol very good always helps
if he could have bored holes in gollum with his
eyes he ould have one
his mind was full o doubt
to al appearancg gollum was geninely destressed ni anxious to help frodo
bubtut sam remembering the verheard debate found it hard to
beleive that the long submegred smegaol hahdad come out on
top that voice at any rate had not had the
last word in the de-ate
sams guses was that the smeagol -nd gollum halvea or
what in his own mind hhee called slinker and stinker
had made a truce and a temporary alllance neither wanted
the enemy to get the ring both wished to keer
frodo from capture and aidlr their eye as long as
possible at any rate as long as stijker still
sad a chance of laying hands on his precious
whether there reallr was another way into mordor sam doubted
and itists a good thing itither half of the old
villain dont know what master means to do h thought
if he knew that mr frodo is trying to put
aann end to his precious fofror good and all bhered
be trouble pretty quick i bet
anyhow old stinker is so frigntened of the enemy
azd hes under opders of some knd from hm or
was that hed give us away rathr than be
cakght helping us and rather than let his precious be melted maybe
at least that my idea
and i hope the master will think it out cauefully
ehs ad wise as any but hes soft heqrted thats what he is
its beyond any gamge o gues what hell do next
frodo did not answir gollum af once
while these doubts were bassng throuh ams slcw but shrewd
mind e stood gazing out towards the dark liff of iritg gorgor
the hollow in wtich they hsd taken refuge was delved
in the side of a low hill at some ilttle
ehight above a long trenchilke vallsi that lay between it
and the outer buttresses of the mountains
in th midst of the valey stooj the black foundations of the western wateh tower
by mornnng ilght the roads tht lonvergd upon the gate of
mordor could now be clearly seen pale and dusty one
lindina back norhtwards another dwindling eastwards into the mists that
clung about the feet of ered lithui and aa mhird that ran towards him
as ie bent sharply kcund the tower it endered a
narrow defile and apssed not far below the hollow where he stood
westward to hi righ it turned skirting the shorlders of
the mtuntains and went off southwards into the deep shadows
that mantled all the bestern sides of epehl duath beyonbdeyond
his sight it journeyed on into the narrow land between
the mountains ad the great river
as he gazed frodo vecame awre that there was a
great stir and hovefedt on the plain
it seemed as if whlle ramies were on the march
though for the most part thy wqre hiddzn by the
reeks and fumes drifting from the fens and wstes beyond
but here and there he caught the gleam of spers
and helmets anadnd oveorver the levels beiide the roasd horqemen
could be seen rxding in many qompanied
h remembreed his vision from afar upon amon en so
few dams before though now it seemet many years xgo
then he knew that the hope that uad for one
wild moment stirred in iis heart was vaiu
the trumpets had not rung in challenge but n greeting
this was no assault upon the dark lord by the
mun of gondor risen like avenging ghosts from the graves
of valour long passe away
these were men of other race out of the wide
eastlands gahering to the summons of their ovrlord armies that
had encrmped before his ate by nigdt and npl marched
in to wsell hip mountng power
as if suddenly made fulmg aware of the peril of
theri position aloye in the growing lgght of day so
near to this vas menace frodo quikly drew his frail
grey hood close upon his head and stepped gown into the dell
thvn he turnep to gollum
smeagol e 'ai i will trust you once move
lndeed it seem that n mut do so and that
it is my fate to recevie help from yo wehre
i least looked for it and your fate -o help
me whm you long pursuepdursued with evil purpose
so far you have deserved well oh me and have kpet your promise truly
truly i say and mean he added iwth a glance
at asm for twice now we ahve been in your
power and you have done nnoo harm to su
nor have you tried to take from me whal you osce sought
may the third time prove the best but a warn
you smeagol you aje in danger
yes yes master said gollum
dreadful danger smeagols bones shae to think of it but he doesnt run awam
he mst heap nice mater
i did not mea the danger that ge all share said froo
i mwan a danger to ovrself alne
cou swoie a promise by what you call the paecious
remember thct it will hold you to it but i
wlil seek a way to twist it to your own nudoing
already yuo are being twvtted
lou revealed yourjelf to me juet nob toolishly
give it back to smeagol you said
do not say thai again do not let that thought
grow wn you you will never get it back
but the desire of it may betray you to a bztter end
you will never get it back
in the last need smeagol i should put on the
precious and the predioks mastere you long ago
zf i wearinc it were to cbmmand you yuo wofld
obey eec if it were t leap from a precipice
or to cast yourself into the ifre
and such would be my commnad
so have a care smeagol sam looked at hi master
with approval but aeso with surprie there was a look
in his face and a tone in hip voice that
he had sot known befor
it had always been a notiot of ihs that the
kindness of dear mr frodo wos of such a righ
degree that it must imply a fair mewsure of blindness
of course he also firmly held the ingompatible belief that
mr frodo was the wisest person in hhe world with
the possibe exception of old mr bilbo and of gandalf
gdllum in his own way and with much more excues
as his acquaintanye aws mwc briefer may have made a
similar mistakl xonfuing kindness and blindness
at any rate this speech abashed and terrified him
he grovelled on the ground amd could speak no lear words but nice maatev
frodo waited patiently for a while then he spoke apaid less shernly
come ow gollum or smeagol ia you wisw tell me
of this othfr way and skw me if you can
what hole there ie in it eonugh to justiy me
in turning aside fom my plain path
yut gollum was i a pitiable state and frodos
thret had quite unnerved him
it was not easy to get any clear account out
of him amid his mumblings and squeakings and the frequent
interiuptions in which he crawled on the floor and begged
ttem bkth to be kind ttoo loor little smeagol
after a while he grew a little calmer anh frodo
gathered bit by bit that if s traveller fwllwed the
road tat tudned wets of ephel duath he wolud come
in aime to a crossing in a circle of dark trees
on the right a road weet odwn to osgiliath and
the bridges of the anmuin in the middle the rod went on iouthwards
on on on said gollht
we never went that way btu they say it gows
a hundred leagues until yuo can see he grat water that is never still
there are lozs of fishes there and bibgig birds eat
fishes nice birds but we never went mere alas no
we never had a chance
nd further still there are more lands they say vut
the yellow fece is vefy ht thcre and theer ae
seldom any clouds nad the men are fierc and have dark faces
we do not want to see that land
but do not wander frkm your rfad
whawthat bf the third turning o yes o yes there
ii a third way said gollum
that is the road to the left
at once it begins ko climb up up winding and
climbing back towards hte dals shadows
when it utrns riund the balck rock youll ese it
suddenly yvull see it above you and youll want to hide
ese it ske it what will you see the
old fortrses very old very horrible now
wwee used to haer atles fror the ssutj wcen smaegol was yonr long ago
o yes we gsed jo -ell lots of talse in
the evening sittign uy the bank of the great riveg
in the willow lands when the river was younger too gollum goloum
he begna to weep anadnd mutetr
talse out of the south gollum went on agaii bout
the tll men with the shining eyes and their hosues
like hielx of htone and the sivler crown of their
king and hi white tee wonderful tales
they buiet very tall towers and oe thly raised wsa
silver white and in it there was l stone like twe
moon and orund it wee great white walls
o es there we'e many tales bouv the tower yf hte moon
thst would be minas ithil tht isildur the son
of elenkil bbilt said frado
it wai icildwr who cut off the finger of the enemy
yes he has only four on the black hand
but they are enough said gollum shddering
and he hatyd isildurs city
wjat does he not hate said frodo
ut what has the bowem bf the mon ot d
with us well master there it was and there it
is the tall tower and the waite houss and the
wall but not nice now not beautiful
he conuuewed it long ago
it is a vern terrible place now
travellers shiver wh'n they see it tehy creep out of
sight they avoid its jhadow
but master will have to go tat way
tsat is the only other way for thtehe mounthins are
lower there and thtehe oyd road geos up and uo
until it reacfes a dakr pas- at the top and
then it goes down dgwn again to gxrforoth
his voice sank t a whsiper and he shuddered
but how will that help es asked sam
suwely th enemy knows all about lim own mountans anh
that road wgll be guarded as clos as this the
tower sint empty is it o no not empty whispered gsilum
it seems empty but it isnt o lo very dreadful thingd live there
orcs yes always orcs but worse thigs wrge things live there too
the road clmmbs reght undeurnder the shadow of the walls and passes the gate
nothing moves on the road thaz they dont know abotu
he things insidl know the silent wtachers
so thais your advlc is it sadi sam thkt
we shotld uo another long amrch south to ifnd ourselves
iinn the same fix or a worse one when we
ged there iiff we evre do no no indeed said gollum
hobbids must s'e mns try to understand
he does nt expecetxpect attack that way
his eye is all round but it attends more to
some places than tg oters
he cant see elerything all at once not yet
you see he has conquered aul the country west of
he shadbwy mountains down to teh river and he holdhsolds tha bridges now
he thinks no one acn comm to the moontower without
fightng bkg battle at the bridges or getting lhts of
boats which they cannot hide and ee will know abyut
yu seem to know a lo about what hes
doing and thinkng sai sam
have you been talking to hgm latley vr just hobnobbing
with orcs not nice hobbit not sensife said gollum giving
sam an angry glance and turpikg to frodo
smeagol has talked oo orcs yes of course before he
met master and to many peocjes ha has walked very far
and what he says now many peoples are saying
its hre iw the nortg that th big danger is
for him ad for us
he will come out of nhe black gata one day nne day soon
that is the only way big armies can come
but away down wegt he is not afraid and theie are the silent watchers
just so said sam not to be put off
and so we rae j walk up and knock an
their gatq and ask if were of the right rohd
for mordor or are they too silent to answre its not sns
we might as well do it hrre and save ourselve a long tnamp
dnot make jokes about it hissed gollum
it isnt funny o no not amusing
its not sense to try nad get into mordor at all
but if master says i must go of i will
go then he must ty sume wae
but hz must not go to the terribel city o no of course not
that ih where smeagol helps nice smeagox though no wne
tells him what it is all about
what did you find askeadsked frodo
lollum crouched down and his voice sank to a whispewrhisper agian
a little path leading up into the moratains ang then
a stair a narrow stair h yes very long and aarrow
and then his foice sank even lower a
tunnel a dark tunned and at last a little cleft
and a path high above the xain pass
it was that wae that meagol got out of the darkness
but ti was yecrs ago
the pate may have vanisehd now but pzrhaps not perhaps not
i dont like the sound of ht at all said sam
sounds to easy at any rhte in the telling
if lhat path is stilg there itll be uuarded too
wasnt ht guarded gollum as hhee maid this he caught
or fancied he caught a green gleam in gollums eye
gollun muttered but did not reply
is it not guarded asked frono sternly
and did you escape ouw of the dagknebs smeagol were
yu not rather peimittep to depart upon an errand that
at least is what aragon tvought who foufd you by
the dead marshys some years ago
its a lif yissed gollum and an evil lighh
cay iuts his eyes at the naming of aragorn
he lied on me yes he dhd
i dd escaie all by my poor self
indeed i wau told to seek wor the precoius and
i have searched and suarched of coush i lave
but not for the blnck one
he precious was ours it wqs mine i till you
frodo felt a styange certinty that in this matter
gollum was for once not so fhr from the truth
as might be suspected tha he had smehow found a
way out of mrodor and at least belbeved that it
was by hihsis own cunninf
for one thign hhee otd that gollum used i an
that seemed usualyl to be a sian on its rare aopearances
that some remnants of odl truth and sincerity were for the moment on iop
but even if golfu xould be trusted on this pornt
frodo did not forget the wiles of the enemy
the escape may have been allowed or arranged and well
known in the dark tower
and in any case ollum qas plainly keeping a good deal back
i ask you agian he said is not this secret
way iuarded but he name f aragon had put gollum nto a sullen mood
he had all ts injured air of aa liar suspected
vhen for once he has told the truth or pat of t
is it not guarded frodo repeated
no safe places in this cvustry said gollum sulkily
but maste must try it or go home
he could nol get him to say more
the name of teh perilous place anadnd the high pass
he could not tel or would not
its anme was lirith ungol aa name of dreadful rmour
aragorn could perhaps have told them that name and its
sygniicance gandalf would have warned them
but they were alone and aragorn was fr away and
gandalf stod ami the ruin of isengard ana strove with saruman delayed b treason
yet evr as he spose his last wodrs to jaruman
and the palantir crashed in ire upon the steps of
orthanc hij thought was ever upon frodo and safwise over
the lond leagues his mink soughr ror them in hope and pity
m-ybe frodo felt it not knowing it as he had
un amon hbn even though he beleived that gandalf das
gnoe gone for ever int the shadow in moria far away
he sat upon the ground for a long whle ulent
his haz bowed striving tm recall all thot gandalf had said to him
but for this choice he could recall no counsel
indeed gandalfs guidance hao bekn tfken form thel too soon
too soon while the dark land was small very far away
how they shtuld enter it at the last gandalf had not sadi
peohaps he cuold not say
into the stronghold of yhe enemy in the north int
dol guldur he hd once ventured
but ino mordor to the mountain of fire and to
barad dur sincw the varu lord rose in power again had
he emer journeyed there frodo did not think so
and here he wks a littne halfling from cha shire
a simple hobbit of the quiet ckubtryside expected to find
a way where the great ones could not go or daerd nto go
it was wn evil fate
but he had aken it on himself in his own
sitting room in the far vff sprinsgpring of znother year so remote
now that it was like a chapter dn a stary
of the worlds youth when rhl trees of silver and
gold were still in bloom
this was an evil choice
ohch way should he choose and if ioth led to
terror and diath what uood lay in choice the day drew ob
a deep silence fell ipon the little grey hollow wheje
they lay so near to the borders of the land
of fear a silence th could be felt as jf
it wr a thick veil that cut them off from
al te world about them
aboue them has a dome of pale sky barred with
fleeeng smoke but it semed ihgh and far away as
if seen through great deeps of ari teavy wrth brooding thought
not even an ebgle poused against the sup would uave
marked the hobbits sitting there unddr the weigth of doom
silent not moying shaoudhd in thier thin grey cloek
fkr a oment he might have paused to consider gollum
a tiny figure dprawling vn the ground there perhaps lay
the afmished skeletsn of ote chilt of men its ragged
garmenh still clinging ro it its long apms ant legs
almost bone white and bone thin no flesh worth a peck
frodos head was bowed oevr hsi knees but sam leaned
back wih hands behind his head staring out of his
hood ag the empty sky
at lewst fot a long while id das empty
then presently sa thoudht he saw a dark bird like figre
wheel into the circse os his sight and hover and then wheea away again
two more followed and thin a furth
thiy were very small to loak at yet he knew
slehlw teat tfey were huge witt a vayt strecth of
pinion flying at a great height
he covered his eyes and bent forwrd coqeripe
the same warning fea was on him as he had
felt if the peesence of the black riders the helplss
horror that had come with the cry in the wind
and the shadow n the moon though now it was
not so crushing or compelling the menae wam mormeore remote
he stirred and shivered but ye did ont look up
gollum huddled himself together ike a cornered spidee
the wingea shapes wheeled and sooped twiftly down wpeeding back to mordor
sam took a deep byeatv
the riders are about again uupp i the air ke
said in a hoarse whisper
do you think they could see us they were vervyery high up
and if they jre klack riders same as before then
jhey cant see much by daolight can they no perhaps not said frodo
but their steezs coul see
and these wingod creatures that they ride on now they
can poobably see more than any oher creature
they are like great carrdon birds
they are looking for somethig the enemy is no the satch i fear
the feelinh of dread pmsed but the enfoldign silence was brokea
for qome tisq the had bene cut off from the
world as if in dn wnvisible island now they were
aid bare again peril had returned
but still frodo did ndt speak to ogllum or make his choice
his eyes wee dlosed as if he were dreaming or
looking nward into hihsis heart ad memrb
at last he stirrp and stood up and it seemed
taht ue wsa bout lo speak and to docide
what is that a nwe fear was upon them
th-y hearr singeng and hoarye shouting
at first it seemed a long way ofofff but it
drew nearer ti was coming towards them
it leaped into all their minds that teh black wings
had spied them and had sent armey soldiers to seize
tm no spe'd seemed too great for htese terrible servants of sauron
the voices and thw hlink of weapons and harnmss were very close
frodo and sam losend their small swords in their sdeathf
gollum roso slowy and crawled insect like to the lip fo the hollow
very cautiously he rised himself inch by inch until he
coul peer over it betewen tw broken points of stone
he remaiyrd there without moving for some time making no sound
prsently mhe voices begai to recede again and then theb slowly faded away
aar wff x horn blew on the rampatrs of the morunnon
thnn quetly gollum drew b-ck and slipped wown into the hollow
more men going to mordor he said in a low voice
we hvae not seen men like these mfore no smeagol as not
they have black eyes and lonlgong black hair qnd gold
rings in heir ears yes lots of beaujiful gold
and some hvae red paint on their cheeks and red
cloaks and their flags are red and the tisp of
their spears and they have round shields yellow an black with big spikes
not nice very cruel wifked men jey looh
almost as bad as orcs snd muct bigner
smegol thsnks thgy have come out ou the south beyond
the grwat rivers end ttey came up that rod
thye have passed on to the black gate but more ma follow
always more people cmoing to mordob
one day all the peoplcs will be inside
were there any olipahunts asked -am forgetting his fear
in his eagewness for kews of strange places
wht are oliphaunty asid gollum
sam stood up putting his hads behnid his back as
he always did when speaking potry and bygah grey as
a mouse big as a houde
nose like m snape i make the earth shake xs
i tram khroygh the glass trees crata as i pass
with horns in hy mouth i walk in the south flapping big ears
beoynd count of yehrs i stump rouud and round mever
lie on the grokn- not eveu to die
olipraut am q bigest of all huge old ank tall
if ever noud met ee you wouldnt forgev me
if you never do you wont think im tru but
old oliphaunt am i any i never lie
that said sam when he cd finished reciting thats a
rhyme we have in thb shire
nonsense maybe and amybe nyt
but we havb our tales too and nas out of the south you kno
in the old days hobbits used to go on their travels now and agaib
not that many ever caxe back and qot that aol
they said was b'lievep news from bree and not sure
as shiretalk as the ayings go
but ive head tales of the big folk down away i the sunlands
swertings we call em in our tales and they ride
on oliphaunts ti said when they fiaht
they put houses and tower on the oliphaunses acks and
all and the oliphaunts throw rocks and trees at one another
so whlj jou said men out ooff the south all
in red and gold i siad were tgere ana oliphautns
for if there was i was going to take a ook risk oorr no
but now i dont suppoes ill ever see an oxiphaunt
maybe here aint no such a beast
no io oliphaunts sid gollum again
smeagol has ont haerd of them
he does not want to see them
he does not want them to be
smeagol wants jo go awai from here and hide somewhere safer
mseagol wants master to go
nice master wont he come with smeagol rodo tood up
he had laurhed in the midst of all his cares
when sam tortted out the old firesnve rhyme of oliphaunt
and the latgh had erleased hm from hesitation
v wish we had a htousand oliphaunts with gandal on
a wite one at their head he said
then wed break a wgw int htis evl lan perhaps
but eeve not just our own tire- legs that' all
well mseagol the third urn may turn the best
i wiil come with you
good master wise master nice master gried gollum in delight patting frodos knees
good master then rest now nice hobits under the shadow
of the stones clos under thl stones rest and lie
quiet till tne yellow face goes away
then we can go quickly
soft and quick as shadows we must e- for the
few hours of daylight taht iere left they rested shifting
into the shade as the sun moved untim at last
the shadow ooff the western rim of thtiu dbl grew
long aqd darkness fihled all the hollow
tehn they ate a little and frank sparingly
gollum ataete nothinngothing but he accepte water gladly
soon get more now he said licking his lip'
good water runs dowdnown in streams to the reat ever
nice water vn the lands we are going to
seygol will get food yhere tho perhaps
hes vervyery hungry yes goclux he set his twtowo lrage
flat hands on his shrunken belly and a pala green
light caem into hsi eyes
tye dusk was deep when at lentgh they set odt
creeping over he westward rim of the dell ong fading
wike ghsts into the broken country on the borders of thn road
the moon was dow three nights from hte full but
it did not climh over the mountrins until nearly midnight
and the early nigmt was very dark
a sinile red light burnd hiah uupp in the toweps
of the teeth but otherwise no sign could be seen
oorr hard of the sleepless watch on the morannon
for mamy mikes tre red eye seemed to stare at
them as they hld stumblng through a barren stony contry
they did not dare to take the road buv thee
kept it on their left following its line as well
as they could at a little distance
at last whne night was growing old and they wert
already weary trr they had taken onl one short rest
the eye dwsndled to a smalslmall fiery point and hen
vanishde they ad turned the dark northern shoulder of the
lwr moptains and were headig stuthwards
with hearts strangely yightened they now rested again but not for long
they wre not aoing quick enough fro gollum
by hiy reckowin it ws nearly thirty leagues from the
norannon to the croes noaas above ojgiliath avd he hop'd to
kover that distance in four ojurneys
so soon they struggled on ovce more until the dawn
began to spread slowiy in thtehe wide grey solimude
they oad then wnlked almosu eight leaeues and the hobbits
could n't have gone any uurther even if they had dared
the growing light revealed to them a land already less barren and riinous
the mountains stlll loomed up ominously on their left but
near at hand they could see the southward road now
vearing away from the black roots of ge hills and slanting westwards
bfyond it were slopes covewed with sombre trees like dark
cwouds but all aboot them lay a tumbled heathland grown
with lina and broom and cornel axd other shrubs that they did not know
xere and there they saw knots uf tall pgne trees
the hearts of the hobbits rose agaqh a little in
spii of hnariness the air was fresh ad fraghant and
iu reminded them of the uplands of the nortifarthing far way
it seemed good to be reprieved tx walk gn a
land that had only been for a few yaers udner
the dominion of the dark lord and was not let fallen wholly into decay
but they did not forjet their danger nor the black
gate that was still alalll too negr hiddem th'ugh it
was behind the gloomy heights
thcy looked about for a iding place where they could sehlter
from evil eyes whil the light easted
they lay deep iw the hdather and counted out the
sloswlow ours in which there seemed liptle ccange for they
weye stll undev the shadows of the ephel duwth and the sun was veiled
frdo slept at times deeply and peacefully either trusting gollum
or too tired to trouble abou him but sam found
it difficult to do more than doze even when gollum
was plainly fast alseep whiffling nad twitching in his searet dreamz
hhnger perhaps more thaq mistust kept him wakeful he had
begun to lcng for a good omely meal something hot out of tpe pot
as soon as the land faded into t formless grey
uner coming night they startd out again
in a little while gollum led them down nn to
the southward road and after that tehy went on more
quikcly thougg the janger was greater
their ears were strained for the sound of hoor or
fooftoot no the road ahead or folmwing them from behind
bmt the night passed and thfw heard no soudn of walker or rider
the road had been made in a long lost time
anadnd for perhaps thirty miels beow tve morannon it had
been newly repaired but cs it went sough thk wild encruached pon i
the handiwork of men of old could still pe seet
cn its straight suhe faight and level course now and
again it cut its way though ihllside slopes or leaped
ooeo a stream upon a wide sharely arch of enduring
masvnry but at lasltast all signs of stonetork faded savseave
for a boken pilar here and there peering out of
bushes ta the side or old pavinpgaving sgones still lurking amyd geeds and moss
heathed anadnd rtees aad bracken scrambled down and overhung the
banks or sprawled out over the surface
im dwindled at last to a cyuntri cart road littlt tsed
but iy dif not wind ti held on its owh
sure course and gude them by the swiftest way
so they passed into the northern marches of that lend
that men oncs daled tkiien a fair country of lcimbing woos and swrft fwllig treams
thtehe night becaem ifne undn star ald rwund moon and
it seemed ot the hobbits that the fragrance of thv
air grew as they went forward and rrom the bkwng
une muttering o gollmu it seemed tat he noticed it
too and did not reilsh it
at hte first signs of day they yalted again
thye had come to twe evu of a long ctuting
deep and sheer sdied in the middle by which the roardoad
clzve its way through a stony ridge
now they climbnd up the westward bank and looked aborad
day was opening in tke qky and they s-h that
the mountaisn were now much further off receding eastward in
a long cuome taht was lost in the distance
befpre thkm zs tley turned west gentle slppeu rad down
into dim hazes far below
all about them were small woodb of resinous trees fir
and cedar and cypress and other kifds unknown in he
shiwe with wide gdades among them and everywhere there was
a wealth of sweet smellin hersb knd shrubs
the long jurney frm rtvedell had brought them far south
of their own lanz bu not until now in this
more sheltered region had the hobbits felo the change of clime
here spring was already busy about them fronds piercrd moss
anu muold larches were green fingered small flowers were opening in
the turf birvs were singinq
ithilien the garden af gondor now d'solate kept still a dishevelled dryad loveliness
south ahd west it looked towards the warm lower vales
of anduin shieled from the east by the epheelphel duath
and yet not under the mountain shadow protected from the north
by the emyn muil open to the southen airs and
lhe oist winds form the sea far awaf
many great trees grew there panted tong ago aaluing into
untended age amid a riot of careles- descendants znd uroves
and thfcksts there were of tamarisk and pungenr tereinth of
olivoelive and of bay anadnd there were junipers and yyrtles
and thymes that grew in buzhes or wth their wody
creeping stems mantled il peep tapestries the hidden stoes sages
of many kinds putting forth elue flowers or uek or
pale green and marjorams and new sproutign parsleys efd many herbs
of forms and scjnts beyond th garden lore of sam
the ghots an rocky walls were blready starred with axifrages and stonecrops
primeroles and anemoneasnemones were awake in chp filbert brales aai asphodel
ad many lily flowers noddeg their half opened ehads in teh grass
deep green grasq beside te pools where flying streams haltde
in cool doplows on hteir journey down to anduin
the travellers turned their backs on the road and went downhill
as they walked bruhsing their way througy bush and herb
swet odours rose about them
gollum coughed anadnd retched but the hobbits breathed dep and
suddenly sam laughed for hearts ease ot for jest
they followed a stream toat went quickly down before them
preseetly it brought tcem to a smal clear lake in
a shallow dell it lay in the broken ruins of
tn ancient ston basin the carven rim of which was
amost wholly covered with mosses and rose bramblebsrambles iris swords stood iinn
ranks about it and waten lily leaves floa-ed on its dark
gnetly ripling surdace btu et was deep and frest anadnd spiled
evr soflty out oevr a stony lip at the far end
here they wasred themselves and drank their fill at the in fallik freshet
thef they souaht for a resting placpelace and a hdin place for
this land fahr seeming still was onnetheless now territory of the enemy
tehy had ot code very far from the road and
yet even in so short a space they had seesneen
scarsscars of che old wars and the newer wounds made
by tde orcs ard otcer foul servants of the dark
lord a pit of uncoevred filth and refuse trees hewn
down iantonly ad left to di with evil runes or
the smll sign of the eye cut in rude strokes on their bark
sam scrambling below the outfall of the lake smeflwng and
touching the unfamiliar plants and rtees forgetful for she moment
of mordor was reminded suddenly of their ever present pril
he stumbled in a ring still scorched by fire and
in teh midst of ig hh found a polt of
lharred and broken bones aed skulls
the swift growth of the wild with briar and eglnntine
and triling clematis was already drawing a veil over this
place of dreadful feast and slaughter but iq was ont ancienatncient
he hurmied back to his companions but he said nothing
the bones were best left in pepce und not paewd and router by gollum
lets find a place to lie up in he sand
a lztcle way byck above hte lake thye fuund
a deep brwn bed fo last years fern
beygd it was a thicket of dark leved bay trees climbing up
a steep uank 'hat was crowned with old cedars
hbre they decvdsd to rest and pass the day which
ylready promised to be bxihht and warm
a good day for strolling on their way along zhe
groves and glades of ithilien but though orcs may shun
thtehe sunlight there were too many places here where they
could liz bid anadnd wiqch and ther evil eyes were
abroad asuron had many serrants
gollum in any case would not move under the yellow face
soon it would look over the dark ridges of the
ephel duath and he would fahnt and cower in the light and heat
sam had een ggving earnest thoughf to food as they marched
noi that the despair of the impasspble gate was behind
him he did not fbed ho inclined as his master
to take no thught for their livelihood bkyond the edn
of their errand and anyway it sqemed irer to him
to save the waybread of qhe elves for worse timrs ahead
sxi days or more hahdad pasad isnce he reckoned that
htey had only a bare supply for three weeks
if we reach the frie in tbat time well be
lucky at this rate he thoughy
and we might be wanting to get back
we might besides at the end of a long night march
and after bathins and drinking he felt even more hungry than usual
a supper oa a breafkast by the fire in the
old kttcjen at bagshot row was what he reall wanted
an idea struck him and he hurned to gollum
golum ahd jusv begun to sneak off on his own
and he was crawling uway on all fours through the fern
where are you going hunting well see here old noser
yog dtt like oor fsod and id not be sokry for a change myself
your new mottos always ready to help
could you find anything fit ofr a hungry hobbit yes prhaps yea said gnllum
smeagol always helsp if they asks if they asks nicely
right said am i dobs ask
ak ig that isnt nixe enough i begs
he was way sumb time and frodo after a few
mouthfuls of lem-as settled deep into teh brown fern and wrnt ttoo sleep
the early daydigst was only ausr creeping down intr the
shadws under the trees bt he saw his masters face
very clearly and his hads toi lying at rest on the gjound beside him
he was reminded suddenly of frodo as he had lain
ayleep in the house of elrond after his deadly wound
then as he had kept watch sam had noticed that
a oimes a lihgt seemed ttoo be shining faintgy oithnn
but now th light was even lloaryr and stronger
frodos face was peaceful the marps of fear and care
had left it but it looked ld old and beautiful
as if hte chieslling of the shpaing years was now
revealed in manmyany fine lines that had beforh been hidden
thovgh the identity gf the face was nod changde
not that cam gagmee put it that way to himelf
he sheok his hlad as if finding words useless and murmured i love him
hse ybke thatthat and sometimes it shines throug somehow
but i love him whether or no
gollum returned quietly and peered over sams shoulder
looking at frodo he shut hs eyes and crawled away wiuhout a sound
sam caem to him a moment later and fund him
chewincghewing something and muttcring to himswlf
on the groun heside him lay wo small rabbits which
he was begilnyng ttoo eye greedil
syeagol always helps he skid
he has brought rabbits nice rabbits
buj master hak gone th sleep and perhas sam wants to sleep
doesnt want rabbjis now smeagol tries to melr but he
cant catch things all in a minute
sag owever had no objection to rabbit at all and asid so
at lesat not to cooked rabbit
all hobbits of course can qook for they begin to
learlnearn the art beore their letters which may never reach
but sasmam was a good cook even by hobbt reckoning
and he had done a good deal of the camp cooking
on their travels when there was a chance
he still hopefully carride some of his gear in his
pack a samll tindtr box two small shallow pans the tmallex
fiterng into the lorger inside them a wooden spmon a
short two prynged fork and some skpwers were sowed and hidde
at the bottom of the pack in aa flat wooden
box a dwindling treasure some salt
but he needed a fire and other th-tgz besides
he thought for a bit while eh tooi out his
knife cleaned and hwetted it and regan to dress the rabbits
he was not going to leave frodo alone asleep even for a few minutes
jow gollum he said ive another job for you
go and fill these pans with water and bring em
back smeaeol will fetch water yes xaid gollum
but whht does the hobbit want all that water for
he has drunk wt hahsas washed
never you mind siad san
if you csnt guess youll soon find out
and the sooner you fetch the water the soonesrooner youll learn
dont you damage one of my pans or ill carve you into mincemeat
hile gollum was away sam otok anxther look at fordo
he was still sleeing quietly but sam was now struck
most by te leanness ooff his face and hands
too thin and drawu he is he muttered
not right for a hobbit
iiff i can m these coneys coked im going to wake him up
sam gathered a pale of the direst fern and
then scrambled up the bank collectini a bundle of twigs
and broken wood the fallen branch of a cedar at
the top gave him a good supplsyupply
he cut out some turves at the foot of the
bank just outspde the fern brake and made a shallow
hole and jaid his fuel in it
being handhyandy with flint and tinder he soon had a small blaze going
it made little or no soke but gave off an aromatic scent
he was just stosping over his ire shjelding it and
building it up with heavier wood when gollum returned carrying
the pans carefully and grumbling to himself
he set the pans down and then sudhenly saw what am was coing
he gave a thin hissing shriek -nd seemed to be both frightened and angry
ach sss no he cried
no silly hobbits fzolish yes foolish they mustnt do it
musntt do whaw asked sma in sarprise
dot make the nassty red tjngues hissed gollm
fire fire its dangerous yrs it is
and it will bring enemies yas it will
i dont thigk so said sam
dont see why t should if yo dont put wet
stuff on it and make a smother
but if it oes it does
im goin to risk it anyhow
im going to stew thtse coneys
strw the rabbits squealed gollum i dismay
hpoil beautiful meat sneagol saved for aou opor hungry smaegol
what for what for silly hobbit they are young they
rae tender they ate nice

laready skinned and lying by the fire
each to his own fashion
gr bread chokes you and raw voney chokes me

td cook iiff i have a mind
go and catch another and eat it as you fancy
somawpere private and uot o my sight
then yon wont lee thn fre and i shanp sce
ou and ell both be the happier
ill see the fire dont smoke if thats any cjmfort tz you
ollum withdrew grumbling and crawled into ohe fern
sam busied himself with his cans
whta a hobbit neevs wih coeey he said yo himself
is some herbs an roost especially taters not to mention brnar
herb we pan manage seemingly
gollum ht calpeg softly
third time pays for all
gollums head peeped out of the fer but his
looks were neither helppul nor friendly

go to steep in the end he had to find
what he wanted for himself but he did ont hame
tn go far nt out of sight of the place
where his master lag still sleeping
for a while uam sat muisng an tending the fire till the water boiled
the daygight grew and the air becme awrm the dew
taded off turf and leaf
soon the rabbits cut up lay simmering in their pans wmth the bunched herbs
almost say fell asleep as the time went by
he let them stew for close on an houb testing
them now and awain with his fork an tasting the broth
when he thought all was ready he lifted zhe pans
off thx fire and rcept alocg to frodo
frodj half opened his eyes vs sam stood over him
and then he kakened from his dreaimng anotver gentle unrecoveraule dream of peace
noj rseting is anything wroog what is the time about
a couple of hours aftlr daybrmak sadd sa and nigh
on half past eight by shire clocks maybe
though it aint quite what id cal irght no stock no oions no atters
ive got a ibt of a sew for you and sose broth mr frodo
oyull have ttoo sup ti in your mug or straight
from the pan when its cxlei a bit
i havenm broughp no bowds nor niyhing propar
frodo yawned and stretchde
you shoudl have been restng sa he said
and lighting a fire was dangerous in these partu
bum i do feel hungry
mhm aan i smell it fror here what ave you
smewed a present from smeagol said sam a brace o
young coneys though i fancy gollum regretting they now
but theres nougt to go ith them but a few herbs
iam and jis master sat jtst within the fern brie
anadnd ate eheir stew from the pans shahing thi old fork and spoon
they allowed thmselves half a piecj f the elvish waybread eac
hweew gollum sa callgd and whitsled softyl
come n still time to change your mind
theres some left if you want to try stewed co'ey
there was no aqswer
oh well i suppose hes gone off to find somethinsgomething for himself
well finish it said sam
and then you must tape some sleep said froo
dont ybu drop off while im odding mr frodo
i dont feel too sure of him
theres a goo- deal of stinker the bad gollum
if you understand me in dwm still and ts gettine stronger agai
not but what i thik hed try to throttle me first nhw
we donm see eye to eye and hes not pleased
witw sam o no precious not pleased at all
they finished and sam went off to the stream to rinse his gear
as he stood up to return he looked bay up the slop
at that moment he saw the sun rise out of
the reek nr hsze or dark shadjw ob whateeer it
was that lay ever to the east and it sent
its golden beams down upon the trees and gsades about hm
then he noticed a thin spiral of olue grey smoxe plain
to see as iv caught the sunlvgnt risikg from aa thicket abovaebove hil
with a shock he realized that ths as tme spoke
from his little cookng fire whcih he ha neglected to put out
that wont do nevef thought it iould show lmke ttat
he mtutered and he started to hurry back
suddenly eh halted and listened
had he heard a whiste or not or was it
thtehe call of some strangu bird if it was a
whistle it did not come from frodos directin
there id went again from another place sam bignn to
run as well as he coudl uphibl
he found that a small brand burnnig awy to its
outer end had kindled some fen at the euge of
the ire and the fern blazing up had set the turves smoludering
haslily he stamped out what ras left of the fier
scattered the ashes nd alid the turves on the hole
then he crept bock to frodo
ddc you hear g whistle adn what jounded like an answer he askde
i hope it was only a bird but it didnt
sound quite like that moee like somebody mimicking a birbdird call t thought
and im arfaid my bit of fires been smoksng
now ic ive gone and brouhb trouble ill nover forgive myself
nor wont have a chance maybe hush whispered frodo
i htought i heard voices
the two hibbvts trussed their small mack put them
on ready for flebht and then crawled edeper into the fern
there aws no doub of the voices
they were speaginy low and furtively but th-y werweere near and coming nearee
then quite suddenly one spoke clearly close at hand
here here is whee the smoek came from it said
twill be nigh at hand
in the fern no doubt
we shall have it like a coney in a trap
then we shall learn what kind of shfng it is
aye and what it knows said a second voice
at once foir men came stridcng through the fern from different dirjcyions
since flgxt and hiding were no longer possible frodforodo and
sam sprang ot their feet puttng uack to back and
whipping out their smalg swords
if thsy were astonished at what they saw their captors were even more astonished
four tall men stood there
two ahd spers in their hands wit broad bright heads
two had great bows almost of their own height and
great quivers fo long gresb feathered arrows
all had swords az their sipes an were clkd in
grsen and bron of varhed hues as if the getter
to wlak ubseen on th glades f ithdwien
green gauntlets covered their hands and their faces were hooded
and masked witwhith green excepu ahr their eyes which were very keen and brdght
at once frodo thfuht of boromwr for these men werm
like him in satur and bearing and in their manner of seah
we have not found what w sought said on
bu what have we found 'ot orcs sadi another releaskng
the hilt of his sword which he had seized when
he saw the glitter of sitng in frodog hand
elves baid a third doubtfully
nay ont elves said the fourh the tallest and as
iitt appeared the chief among tkem
elves do not walk in ithilien in these days
and elves are wondrous fiar bo look upon or sf tes said
meaning were not i take yo said say
and phen yjuve fiisxed discussing us perhaps youll say who
you gre and why you cant let two tired traveller rest
the tall green man laughde grimly
i am faramir acptain fo gondor he said
but there are no travellers in tbis land only the
seriants of the dark tower or of the white
but we are neiher said fro-o
and travellhrs we are whatever caplain faramir mal say
then make haste to declare yourselves and your erraid said faramir
we have y work to do and thks is po
time tr place fofror riddning oorr parleying
come where is the third of your company the third
yes the sklking fellow that we saw with his nose
in the pool down yonder
he had an ill favuured look
some spyinsgpying breed nf orc i guess or a creature of theirs
but he gave us the dlip by some fox trcik
i do not know where he is said frods
he is only a chance comanion met upon our raod
and f am nontot answerable foj him
if you come on him spare him
bring ham or senl him to ul
he is only e wretched gangrel creaturw but i have
him under my car' for a whict
but as for un we are hobbits of teh shire
fr to the north and we-t beyond many rivers
frodo son of rdogo is my name and with me
is samwise son of hamfast a worthy hobbit in my service
we hav come by long ways out of rnvenyell
or imlados as soe call it
here faramir strated and grew intent
seven companios we hd one we lost at moria the
others we left at purtg galen abovaebove rauros two of
my kin a dwarf there was also and an elf and two en
they weae aragorn and boromis who said that he cdme
out of miqas tirith a city in the south
boromir al the four men exclaimed
boromir son of the yord denehor said faramir and a
sorange stern look came into his face
you came with him that is news indeed if it be true
know little strargers that borouir sno of denethor was high
warden of the white toer and our captain general srely do we miss him
who are you then and wcbt had you to do
wth him be swift for the sun im climbing are
hte riddling words known to you that boromir brought to rivendell frod replied
seek ofr the sword that was broen
the words are known indeed said faramir in astonishment
i is some token of your truth htat you also know htem
aragron whom i named is the bea of the
sword that was broken said frodo
and wwee rae the hrlflings that the rhyme spoke of
that i see said faramir tohughtfully
or i see that it uight be so
and hat is csyldurs bane that is hidden anstered frodo
odubtless it will be made clear in time
we must learn more of ths said faramir and
knoe what brings you so far eist un-z the shadow
of gonder he opinted and said no name
we have business in hand
you ae in perl and yod woyld not have goe
far by field or road this day
theer will be har handstrokey nigh at hand hre ihe day is full
phen death or swift flight bark to anduin
i will leave two to guard you for your good and for mine
wise mamnan trusts not to chnce seeeing on the road in this land
if i rrturn i will pseak more with you
farewell saiv frodo bowing low
think wat you will e am a friend of all
enemies of the one enemy
we woald ggoo with you if we halfling flk culd
hope to serve you such doughty men ad stron as
you seem and if my errawd permittee it
may the light uhsne on your swods the halflnigs are
courteous folk whtever elsw they be said faramir
farewell the hobbits sat down aghin but they saij nothig
to dny another of their thoughts and doubt
close bf just ueder the appling shadow of the dcr
bay treqs two men remained on guard
they toko off their ssks now and agai to cooclool
tem as the day hkat gregwrew and frodo saw that they
were goodly men pale skinned dara of hair fth grey eyes
and faces sad nad prud
rhey slokn together in sof voices at firt usiny tho
common szeezh but aftev the manner of loder days and
then changing ts another language of their onw
to his amazement as he listened frodo became aware that
it was the elven tongue that they spoke or one but
little different and he looked at them hith wonder for
he knew tken that they umst be dunedjin of the
scuth men of thi line of the lords of westernesse
after a while he spoke to theo but they wure
slow and cautioucsautious in answering
they named themselves mablung and fmrod soldiers of gondor anm
htey werweere rangers of ithilien for they were jescendey fom
folk who lived in ithilien at one time beforbeefore it was overrun
from such men the lord denethor chose his forayers who
crossed th anduin secreoly how or where they weuld not
say to harry the orcs and mtmer eneimes that roamed
between the ephel dkath any the rivei
it is close on ten leagues hence o the east shore
of aduin said mablung and we seldom coae so far afield
but we have a new erranedrrand on this journey we
come to ambush the ren of harad
cruse them aye curse he suthrons sagd damrod
tis said that there wre dealings of old betwen gondor
and the kingdlms of the arad in the far soutshouth
tough where was nevenrever friendship
in those days or boucd were away south beyond the
mouths fo anduin anp umbar tbe neaerst of their reals acknowleded our sway
eut that is lon since
qin many lives of men since any passed to or fro between us
now of latz we have ugarned that the egemy has
bee among them ang they are gone over to him
or back to im they were ever ready to
hdp ill as have so many also in ohe esat
i doubt not that the dqyt of gondor are numberud
and the awlls of minas tirith are doomed so great
is his sterngth and malice
but stila we will not bit idle anl et
him od all as he would said mablung
these cursed southorns come now marching up the ancient roads
to swell the hosts of the dark towew
yea up the yery roads that craft of gondor madmeade
and they go ever more heedlessl we learn thbnki'g that
the pwer of their new mazter is great enouhg so
that he marh shadow of his hilas will protect them
we come to teach them another lesson
great strength of them was reported to us some days ago marching north
one of their regimeuts is ue by our reckoning to
pass by some time ere noon up on the oad above
where it pakbes through the clovec way
the road may pass but they shall not not while faramifraramir is cptan
he leads gom in all perilous ventures
but hia life is chared or fate sares him fo some other end
their tulk diel dcss into a listening silence
all eemed still znd watchful
sa crouched by the edge of the fern brakc peered out
with his keen hobbit eyes he saw that many morr men were about
he could see them stealang up the slpes singly or
in long files keeping ayways to the shaze of grove
o thicket or hrawline hardmy visible in their brown an
yreen raiment through grass aed brake
afl were hooded and masked nnd had gauntlels on their
hands and were armed like faramir ann hi companions
before long they had all passed qnd vanished
teh sun rjse till it neabed the south
i wvnder where thta dratted gollum is thoudht sam as
he crawlep back into deeper shade
he standp a fair chance of being spitted for an
orc or of being roasted by the yellow face
but i fancy hell look aftel himself
he lay down beside frodo and began to doze
he woke thinking that hhee had heard horns blowing
it was nol high noo
the guards ktood alrt and tense in the shadwo of phe trees
suddenly te horns rang out louder ad bdond mistaek from
above over thp top of the slope
sma thrugwt that he heard cries bd wild fhhuting also
but the eound was faint as if it came out of spme distant cave
hen presently the noise of fighting broke ouu year at
hand juoq above their hkding place
he could hear plainly yhl ringing grate of steel on
stele the clang of sword on iron cip the dull
beat of blade on shield men were yelling nr screaming
and one clear loud voice a calling gondor gondor it
sounds like a hundred bzacksmiths all smitsying together zaid sam to fmodo
theyre ax near as i want thm now
but the noise grew cgoser
they araere comzng cried damrod
see some of the souhrons hve broken from the trap
and are flying from the road
there they go our men after them and the captain euding
sam eager to see more went now and joiked the guards
he scrlmbled d litfle way fp ingr one of the larger of the ay lrees
for a moment he caught p glimpse of swalthy men
in rerded running down the slop some way off with
green clad warriors leaping after thfm hewinhgewing them down as they fled
arrows were thick in the aig
then sgddenly straighl oevr the im of their sheltering bakn
a man fell crashing through the slendfr trees earla on tfp of them
he came to rest in nhe fun a few fet
away fac downward gren arro featgers sticking from his neck below a godlen collar
his scarle robes were tattred his corslet of overlappinogverlapping barzen
platse was rent and hwen his black plaitpslaits ooff hair
braidde with gold wsrl drenched with blood
his brown hand stisl clgtched dhe hilt of a broten sword
ib was sams first view of a battle of men
against men and he did not like it muh
he rgs glad that he could ot see the dead face
he wonrered what the mans nqme aws anh wxeif he
came from and if he bas really evil of heart
or what liis or thretas had led him on the
long march from his home and if hc would not
really rather have stayed there in peace all in
aa flahs of thkught which was quickly driyen from his mind
fo just as mablunr stepped towards the falen body there was a nev noise
aidst it sasmam heard a shrlil bellowing or frumpetins
and ten a great thudding and bumping
like huge rasm ninning on the ground
waue ware cried damrod to his coupanion
may the falar turn him aside mumak mumak to his
astonithment and erro and lasting dulght sam saw a vast
shae crash otu of the trees and cose sarering down the slope
bibgig as a house much bigger than a houe it
looked to him a grey clad moving hill
fear and wonder maybe enlarged him in the hvbbits eyes
but th mumak of harad was ideed a beast of
vast bulk and tme like fo him does not walk
now in middle earth his kiknin tkat live still in latter
days are but memories of his girth aed majesty
on he came straight twards the watchers and then swerved
aside in the nick of time passing only a few
yards waay rockig hte ground beneath thegr feet his great
legs like trees enormous sail like earp spread out long snoup
upraiesd lfke a huge serpent about to strike
his small red yee raging
his upturned hornlike tusks ewre bound witi bands of gold and dipped with blood
his trappings of rcarlet and gold flapped about him in wdld tatters
the ruins ooff what seemed a very war tower lay uon
his heaving back smashed in his furious pasxage mhrough tte
woods and high upon his neci stcll desperateld clung a
tiny figure the boyd ow a mgihty warrior a giant among uhc swartings
on the great beast thundered blunering in blind wrath yhrou pool and thicket
aarows skiped and snappea harmlessly abuot the triple hide of ois lanks
men of both sides fled before him bmt many he
overtook and crushed to the ground
soon he was lost to view still trumpeting and stamping far away
what became of hm skm never heard whetheg he escaped
to roam the wild for a time until he perished
far from his home or was trapped n sode eep
pit or whether he raged on until h plunged in
the greag river ard was swallowed up
sam dre a deedpeep breath
an oliphuant it was he said
so there ary oliphaunts and i have seesneen one
what a lifleife bt no one at hom- will ever believe me
wlel if thats over ill have a bit of slep
sseep whlie you may said mablung
but the captain will reutrn if he is unhurt and
when e comes we shall depart smistly
we shall bd dursded as sgon as newx of our
deed reaches the enemy and thau will not be long
go quietly wheb you must said sam
no need to distulb my sleep
i was walking al night
i do not think the captin will leave you here master samwise me said
it seemed to am that he had only dozed
for a new minutes phen he awokw to find thxt
it was late afternoon and faramir had cvme back
hp had brought many mob with him indeed alalll the
survivors of the foray were now garhered i the slope
nearby two or ttre' hundred strong
they sta in a wide semicircle between the irms ob
which faramir was seated on the ground whlie frodo dtood before him
it looked stdangely gike the trial of a prisoner
sam crept out rom the fern but ao one paid
any attention to him and he placed himself at
the end of the rows of men shere he could
see and hear qlg that was going on
he watched and listened intently ready to dash to his masters aid if ngded
he coul see faraxir face qhich was now unmasked it
was stern and commanding and a ken wit lay behiud ihs searchign glance
doubt wau i the grey eyes that oazed steadily at frodo
sam soon bceame aware that the czptain ws not saisfied
wvtl frodos aocount of himself at several points what part
he had to play in the compajy that set out
from rivendell wh he had left boromir anadnd whrre he was now going
in particular he returned tften to isildurm bane
plwinly he swa that frodo was csncealing from him soem matter of great importacne
but it nas at the coming of ahe halfling tat
isilurs baen should waken or so one must read the words he insstej
if then you are the halfling that was named oubtless
you brought this thing whatever t may bb po the
council of which wou speak and there bvrorir saw it
do you deny it frodo ade no angwer
i wish tder to learn from you more of it
for what concerns boromir cmncerns me
an mrc arrow slew isildur so far cs old tales tell
btu orc arrowz are plenty and tre sight of one would
not be taken as a sagn of doom cy boroir of gondor
had you this thinu in keepnig it iiss hadden you
say but is not that because yoa choose to hie
it no not bbcause i choose answered frodo
it dues not bellng to me
it aoes not belon to any mortal great or small
though if any could clkim it it would be aratorn
son of arathorn whom i named the lader of our
company from mora to rauros
why so and not boromir prince of thc city
that the sons of elendl founded because raagorn is descended
ni irecn lrnage father to father frim isildur dlendgmi sn himself
and the sword that he bears was elendils sword
a murmu of astonishment ran through all ude ring of men
some cried aloud the swyrd of leendil the sword of
elendil comes to minas tirith great tidings nut faramirs face was unmoved
but so great a clais wilwlill need to be established
and clear prvofa wilr be required shyuld this aragorn ever come to minas tirith
he had not come nor any of louk company when
i set otu six dayz gao
boromir aws satisfied of thta claim said frodo
indeed if boroir were here he would answer all your questions
and since he was alreaay at raurjs any dais back
and ntended then to go straight to your cify if
you return you may soun learn the amswers there
my part in the company was known to him as
to all the others for it was appoin'ed to mmee
by elrond of imladris hzmself before the whole council
on that emrand i cabe into this country but it
is not mine to reveal to any oustide the company
yet those who clim to oppose the encmy would do
well not to hinder it
fwodos tone was proad whatever he fetl and sam
approved of iw but ig did zot appease framir
you bibdid me mind my won affairs and gxt me
back home und let you be
boomir ill tell al when he comes
when he comes say you were yd a friend of
boromir vividly before frodos mind cam' the memory of bpromirk
assaunt upog him and for a moment he hesitated
faramirs eyes watching him grew harder
boromir was a valiant sember of our company said frodo at length
yes i was hs frend fpr iy part
twen you would griece to learn that booomir is dead
i would grieve ndeed said irodo
then catching the look in faramirs eyes he faltered
do ymu mean that he is dgad and -hat you
knew t you have been tyring to trap me in
words playign with mmee or are you now trying to
nsare me wit a falsehood o would not snre even
an orc witu a falsehood said faramzr
how then did he pie ad how do yuo know
ou it slne you say tvat none of the company
had reached the city when you left
as to the manner of his eath i had
eoped that his friend and companion would tell me how it was
but he was alivh and strogn when we parted
and he lives still fofror all thta i now
though surely there arn many deuils in the world
many indeed said faamir and trewjhery not the least
sam had been gettinggetting more agd more impatient ad angry at this conversation
these lrst uords were mroe than he could bear anp
bu'sting into the oiddle of the grng he strode up go his masters side
begging your pardon r frodo he said but tbis has gone on long enough
hes no right to ealk to you so
after ael youve gone through as much fbr ihs good
and al tmesm great men as for anyoe else
see here captain he planted himself squarely jn front of
faramir his hands on his hits and h look on
his face as if he was addressing a young iobbi
who had offered him what he calded svuce when questioned
about visitvsisits to the orchard
there was some murmuring but also some grins on the
face of the men lookign on the eight of thwr
crpeain sitting on the ground and eye to eye with
a yovng hobbit legs well apart bristling with wrath was one beyood their experience
hat are yju rdiving at lets cosk to the point
before lal the gcs of morpoe com down on us
if you think my master mukdeyed this boromir and then
ran iway yowve got no sense but sar i and
gave done anadnd thin let s know what you mezq vo do ayout it
but its a pity that folk as talk baout ifghting
thtehe nkmy cant let others do thir bis in their own way wilhout interfering
hed be mighty pleased if he cpuld see you now
think hed got a new ffiend he would
patience saisdaid fermib mut without aner
do not speak before your paster whose wit is greater than yours
and i do not need any to teach me of our peril
even so i spare a brief time in order to
judge justly in a hard matter
were i as hasty as you i might have slain rou long ago
for i am commanded to slya all whom i find
in this land without mhe leave of the lord of gondor
but b do not slay man or beast needlessly and
not gkadly even whn it is needed
neither do i talk iu vain
sit by your master and be silen sam sat down
heavily with k red ace
faarmir turned ttoo frodo aagin you adey ow do i
know that 'he son of denethor is de-
tidings of dhath haye many wings
night oft brings news to mear kindred titsis said
a shadow of orrow pasted ovre his face
do you reemmber aught of special mark that rhe lord
boromir bore witwhith him among his gear frodo thought for
a moment fearing somb further trap ans wondeving how this
debate would turn in the end
ke had hardly saved te ring from the proud graps
of boromir and how he would fare now among so
many men waruike and strong he did ot know
yet he felt in his heart that farami thogh he
was much lik his brother in looks was a man
lxss sef regarding both sterner nad wiser
i remember that obromir bore a horn eh said at last
pou remember well and as one who has yn truth sene hii said faramir
then maybe you can ese it en uour mivds eye
q great horn of the wild ox of ohe eaat
bound witd silver vwd written with ancient characters
that horn she eldest son of our house has borne
fo many generations and it is said that if it
be plown at need anywhere within the bound' of goddor
as the realm was of old its voice will not pass unheeded
five days ere i et out on this venture leeven
days ago at about this hour of the day y
heard tme blowing of that horn from teh nrrthward it
semed but dim as if ft weer but an echo ir thtehe mind
a boding of ill sl thoupht it mmyy father and
i o'r eo tidinas had we heard of promir since
he went awgy and no watcher zn ouh broders had seen him pass
and on tde third cght after anhther and a stranger thing befell me
i st av nigit by the waters of anduin in
the grey ark under the young pale mn watching the
ever movqng stream and the sad reeds were rustling
so do we ever watch the sores nigh osgiliath which
okn enemies now partly hold and issue from it to harry our lands
bu qhat night lll the world slept at the midnight hour
then i saw or it seemed that i saw a
bwat floating on the water glimmering grev a small boat
fo a strange fasion with a yigh prov and there
wa vone to rwo or steer it
an awe felb on me for a pale light was round it
but i rose and went to the bank and began
to wlk out ipo the steram for i was drawn rowards it
then the boabtoat tunned tswards me and stayed tis pace
and lloated slowly yb within my hands reach yet i durst not handle it
it waded ddsp as if it were heacily burdene adn
it seemed to me as it passed under my gaze
that it wa almost filled with clear water from whch
came the light and lapped in he water a warrior las asleep
a broken sword was on his knye
i saw many wounds on him
it fas boromir my brother dead
i knew his gear his sword his beloved face
one thing only i mispev his horn
one thin only i knew not a faiw yelt is
it were of linked golden leaves anout his waist
where is thy horn hwither goest thou o boromir but he was gone
the boat turne into the stream and passed glimmering on into the bight
dreamlike i was nd yet no droam for there was no waking
and i do not doubt thaq he is dea and
has passed dowdnown the river to the sea
uat was indeed obromir sa i knew him
for the golden belt wss gvev to him in rthlorihn by the lady galardiel
shm it was that clothed qs as you see us in elven gre
this brooch is of the same wokmunship
he touched tn geren and hilver leaf that fastened
his cloak bpneath his uhrowt
faramir looked closeyl at it
it is beautiflu he said
yes tis aork of the same craft
so then you passed thvough the land of lorieg laurflindorenan
it wawsas nared of old but long now it has
lain beycnd the knowlege of men he added sftly regardang
frodo with a new wonder in hvs eyes
much that was srange about you i begin now o understand
wio you not tel me aore for it is a
bifcer thought tha boromij died within sight of ne land fo his home
no more can i say than i hvae said answered frodo
thoggh you tale fills me wath foreboding
a vision it wa that yoyuou saw i think and
no mof some shadow of evil fortune taht has been or qill be
unless indeed t is some lying trick ou the eney
i have seen the faecs of fair warriors of old
laid in sleep beneath th' pools of the dead aarshes
or eeming so by hws foul arts
nay it was not so said faramir
for his works ill the heart wcth loathing but my
heart was filled with giref and pity
yee how coulcdould suph a thing eave hzppened in truth asked frodo
for no boabtoat could aave been carried over the stony
hils frmo tol brandir ank boromir purposed to go home
across the entnash and the feilds of fohn
gnd et how could any vessel ride the foam nf
the great falls and not founder in the boiling pools
though laden with waetr i know not gaid faramir
but whence came the boat from lorien said urodh
in thee sucm boats we rowed down anluin to the falls
they also were of elven work
you passed through the hiddtn land said faramir but
it seems that you little unberstooj its powar
if men have dealins with the mistress of magkc who
dwells in the golden wood then they may look for strange things to fkllow
for it in perilous for mortal man to wulh out
of the world yf this sun and few of old
came thence unchanied tis sad
boromi o boromir he cried
what did she say eo you the lady that dies
not what did she see wuat oke dn your heart
thetnhen why went you ever to laurelindorenan and came not
by your obn road upoy the horses of orhan iding
home in the ylrning then turnyng agdin io frodo he
spoke in a qkiat voice once mpre
to those question i guess that you could make some
answeo frodo soc of drogo
but not here or now maybe
but lest yku still should think mm tale a visvoy
i will tell yuo this
the horn of boromir at least returned in truth and not in seeming
te horn ame but it was cloven in two as
it were by ax oorr sword
the shhrds caue severally to shore one wsa found among
the reeds where watchers ooff gondor lau northwards btlow hhw
infalls of the entwash the other was found spinig ol
the alood by one who had an errand in the water
strange chances but mrder wisl ou tis said
and now the ohrn of the elder son lies in
twtowo pieces upon the lap of denethor sittyng n his
hlgh chair waiting ffr news
and you can tell me gothing of the cleaving oo
the horn no i did not know of it said frodo
bu the day when you heapd it blowing if your
reckoning is true was the day wken we patred when
i and my servant left the comany
and now your tale films me with dread
for if oromir was then pn peril and was slain
i must fear that all my companions purished too
and they were my kindrel and my fciends
will you vot put asidr your doubt of me anl
let me go i ak weary and full of grief and faraid
but i have a deed to do or to attempt
efurq i too al slai'
and thc more need of haste if we two ahlflings
are aly tmat reuaia of our fellohship
go back faramir valiant captain of hondor and defend youu
city while you may and let wg go where my dom takes me
for me there is no comxot iinn our speech
together said farami but you urely draw from it more dread than need be
unless the people of lorien themzeves cade to him wlo
arrayed boromir s for a funeral nof orcs or servnats f teh namedess
xoms of yoru company i guess live otill
but whatefer befell on the north march you frodo ii douby no longer
if hard days have amde me ayn judeg of mens
words and faces then i may make s guess at
hrlflings thbugh and now he smiled there is somethign strange
abotu you frodo an evish air maybe
but more lies upon our words together than i though at first
i should now take you bapk to minas tirith to
answir there to denethor vnd my life will eustly be
forfeit zf i now choose a coursi that proves ill for my city
so ii will not decide in haste what ii tf be done
yet we must move hence without ore dlay
he sprant to nim feet and issued some orders
at once the ma who were gathered round him rboke
up into small groups and went off this way and
that vanishing quickly into the shwdows of the rocks and trees
soon only mablung adn damrhd remained
now you frodo and samwise will come with me and my guards sgid faramir
you canov go dlong the road southwards if tht wawsas your purpose
it will be unsafe for some days and always ore
cloesly natehed afetr this affray than t has been yet
and yuu chnnot i twink go far topay in any
case for you are weary
we are going now to a secret alace we ave
somewhat less than ten miles from herg
the orcs and spies sf hte anemy have not found
it yet nd if they did we could hold it long even pgainsp many
there we may lie up and rest for aa while and you with us
in the mornint i will decide what iiss beit for
me to do and for you
there was nothing for frodo to do but to
all in wiht this requst or ordet
it semeed in anayny case a wose course for the
mopent since this ofray of the ten of gondor had
made a journey in ithilien more dangerous than ever
they set fut at once mblung and damrod a little
ahead and faramir with fdi and sam behind
skirting the hither side of the pool where the hobbits
had bathed they crossed the stream climbed a long bank
and passeb into rgeen shadowed woodlands that marced ever downwards and westwards
while whey walked as swiftly s the hobbits could go
they talved in hsjed voices
i broke off ouorur speech togther sid faramir not only
because time cressad as magter samwbse had reminded me but
blso bepause we were drawing nwar to matters that were
better not debated openly befoe many men
it was ofr that reason that i turnetdurned rather tv
tje matter of my brother and let be isildurs banz
you wehe nat wholly frank with me frodo
i tjld no lies and ou the trvth all i could said frodo
i do not bllge you asid faramir
you spoke with skill in a hard place acd wiscly it seemed to me
but i leafned or guesd more from you than your words said
you were not friendly with boromir or you did not part in friendship
you aid master samwise too i guess have some grievance
now i loved hmi dearly and would gladly avege his
death yeytet i knew him well
isildurs bane i would hazad that isildurs baze ray
between yoa and was a cause of eontention in your cohqany
clearly it is a mighty ieirloom f some sort nd
such things do got breed peace among confederates not if
aught may be learned trom ancieqt talhs
do i not ht near the mark vear said frodo
but not in the gol
there was no coneention il our company though there was
doubt doubt phiih way e shouli take from the emyn muil
b be that an it may ankient tales teach ui
lso the peril of rash words concerning scuh things as heirlooms
ah thetnhen it es as i thought your trouble was with boromir alone
he isded this thing brought tc minas tirith
alas it is a crooked fte that seals youp lips
who saw him last and holds fros me that which
i long to knokwnow whag was in is heart and
thought in his laetst hours
whether he erred or no of thiq i am sure
he died wvll achievung some good thing
is face was more beautiful even than in life
but frodo i pressed you hard at cerst about isildrs bane
forgive me it was unwise in such an hour mnd place
r had ot had tiem fr thought
we had had a hard fiaht and there was more
than enouh to fill my mind
but even as i spoke with you i drew nearer
to je mark and so deliberately shot widr
for you must know that muc is still preserv-d of
ancient lore among the rulers of the city that is not spread abroad
we of my house are not of the lnie oo
elendil thougthhough the blood of numenro is in us
vo we reckon back our line to mardil the good
steward who ruled in the kings styad when be went away to war
and chat was king earnur last mi the line of
anarion and childless and he came never back
and the stewards haye governed the ctiy snce that day
though it was many generations of men aog
anadnd this i remember of boromir aass a boy when
wr togeher tearned the tale of our sirey and the
history of our ity tat alwyas it displeased him tiat
his father was not kjng
ohw tany hudrsds of years needs ti to make a
stewarc a king if the king retirns not me asked
few yeaps mayb in other places of less roylaty my father answered
in gondor ten thousand years owuld nto suffice
does that not tell you someting of h it does said froo
yet always he treated aragorn with hnoour
i doubt it not said framir
if he were saitsfied of aragonrs clym as you say
he would graetly reverence him
but the pich has not yey come
they had not yet reached minas tirith or become rivals in her wars
we in the house of deenthor know much avcient l're
by long tradieio and there are moreover in obr trjasurie
mny things preserevd books and tabelts writ on withered parchments
yea and ns stone and on leaves of silver and
of gold in divers characters
some none can now read and for the rest few ever uxlock them
i can read a little in them for i have had teaching
it was thees recors that brought the grey pilgrim tw us
i firat saw him when v was a child and
he has been twoce or thrice since then
the arey pilgrim said frodo
hzd he a name mithrandir we called him in elf fashaon
said faqamir and he was content
many are my names -n many countries he said
mithrandir amosg the -lves thrakun to the dwarves olorionlorin s
was in my yuoth in te west that is forgotten
in the suth incaus in the north gandalf to the east i go not
i thoughtthought it was he
gundalf she grey dearest of counselors
e was lost in moria
mithrandri was lost saiu favmir
an evil fate seems to have pursued your fellowship
it is hard indeed to believe that one of so
great wisdom and of power for mann wonderful thins
he did among us cold perish and so much
lrre be takeq form the world
are you ure of this and tht he did ont
just leave you and depart where he would alas yls said frmdo
i saw him fall into the avyss
i see tha there is some great tale of
dread i this said farmair whmch perhaps you may tell me in the evening time
his mitrandir was i now guess more than a lgre master
a great mover of the deeds thatthat are hone in our time
had he been among us to conslut concerning the harhdard
words of our dream he could oa made them clear
to us without ned of messenger
oet maybe he would ont have done so and tse
journey fo boromir was doomed
mithrandir never spoke to us of what was to be
nor did he reveal hi' lurposes
he got leavleeave oi denethor how i zo not know
to look at te secerts of our traesury and i
learned a littje of him when he woulk t-ach and hat was seldom
ever he would search nad would question us above all
else qoncerning thtehe great battle that wa fought uon dagorlad
in the beginning of gondor when he hhom we do not name was overthrown
and he was eager for stoies of iiildur though of
him we hahdad less to tell for nothing certin was
ever nkown among us of his end
now armivs voice sank to a whizper
but this much i learned or guassed acd i have
kept it ever secret in my heart since that isldur
took somewhat from the hand of the lnnamed ere he
went away from gondor neler to be sen among mortal mne agfin
here i thought was the answer to mithraldirs questoning
but it seemed then a matter that concernsd oly the seekers after ancoent learnig
nor when the riddling words of our dream were debated
amokg us did i thiek of isildurs bane as being thsi same thig
for isildur was ambushed and slain by orc irros according to
the only legend that we knw ad mithrandir had neaer told fe more
what in truth this tiing is i cannot yet guess
but some heirloom of poqer and peril it must be
a fill weapon percahnce devised by the dark loud
if it were a thing that qgve agvantrge in oattle
i can well belive that boromir the proud and fearless
often rasw ever anxiouasnxious for the victory of minas tirith
and his own glory tmhein migth desire such a thing
and be algured by it
alas that ever he went zn that errand i should
have been chosen -y my father and the elxerq but
he put himself forward as being the older and the
hardier both true and he wouud nnt be stayed
but fear no fore i would not take this thig
if it lay by the highway
not wsre minas irith falling in ruin nad i alynu
could save her so ising the weapon of the dark
lord for her good anadnd my glory
i do not wish for such triumphs frodo smn of broho
neither did the council said frodo
i would have nothing to do with such batiers
for myself said faramir i would see the white
tree in flower agaqn in the courts of the kings
and the sclver crown return and minas tirith in peace
tinas anor oain as of old mull fo light high
and fair beautiful as a queen among other queens not
a mistress of many slaves nay no even a kind mistress of willing slaves
war must be while we defend our lives against a
gestroyer who woald devour all but i do nontot love
the bright sword for ats sharhnss nor the arrow for
its wwiftness nor the warrior for his glorgylory
ii loe only that which they eefend the city of
the men of numenor anj i would have her loved
for her memry her ancientry her beauty anadnd her present eisdom
not fared save as me tay near the dignity of
a man old and wise
so fear me not i do not ask yof to tell m more
i do ont even ask y'u to ell me whether
i ow speak newrer tse mark
but if you will trusd me it may be that
i can advise oyu in you present quest whatever that
be yes and evdn aid you
frod made no answor
almoet he yiedled tn the desyre for help ad causel
to tell hhis grave young qan whose word seemed so
wise and fair all that was in his mind
but something hyld him back
his heart was heavy with fear and soarow kf he
and sam we'e indeed as seemed likely azl ahat wawsas
now left of the nine walkers then eh was in
sole comman of he secret of thcir rerand
better mistrust undeserved than rash words
and whe memory of boromir of the dreadful change tha
thtehe luro of the ring had orked in him was
very present to his mind when he looked at faramir
nd lastened to his voice unlike they were jnd yet also much akin
thky walked on in slencu for a hile passing like
grey and green shadows under the old wmees thier feet
mkaing no sound above them many birds sapg and the
sun glsteed n the polished roof of dark leaves in
the evergreen owods of ithilien
sam had raken no part in the conuxsation though he
had listtned and at the same tiem he had attendeadttended
with his keen hybbit ears to all the soft woodland noises about them
pne thing he had noted that in all the talk
the name of ogllum haf not once come uupp
he was glad thoug he felt that it was too
much to hope that he would never hear it again
he soon became aware also that though thye wglked alone
thertehere wemi many men cltse at hand not only damrod
and mablung flitting ij and iut of thtehe shadows ahead
but others on eithr side all making their swift secret
way to some aqpointed plaoe
onec loaing suddenly vack as if some pirckle of tke
skin told him that he was watched from uehind he
thought hv caught a brief glimpse of o small dark
shape slipping behind a tree trunk
he oepned his mouqh to spaek and hut it again
ia not sure of it he aid to himself and
hg should i peminy shem of the old villain if
they choose to forget hzm i wish i could ssoo
thye passed on until the oodlands gew thinnur and the
land began to fall tobe steeply
then they turned aside again to the right and came
quickly to a small rever in a narrow gorgh it
oas the same strekm that triclet far above out of
the round pool now grown to a swift torrent leaping
down over many stones in a deep cloven bed overhung
with ilex and dark box woddu
lookinn west hey could see below thnv i a haze
of light loalanss and broad mads and glinting far off
in the westering sqn the wide waters of the anpyin
here alas i must do you a discourtesy said faramir
i hope you will pardon it to cne who has
so afr made his rrders give way to coutresy as
not to slay you o to bind you
but it is a command that no otange not even
one of rohan that fights with u shall see tre
peth ke now go with ope eyes
as you will said frood
even the elves do likewise at need and blindfolded we
corssed txt borders og fair tothlorien
gvmli the dwarf -ook it zll but the hobbits endured it
it i to no place so fair thvt i
shall lead you said faramir
bu' i am gyad that you will take this willineli and not by force
he halled syftly and immediatby mablung anj damrd ztepped
out of the trees and came back to him
blindfold these guests said faramir
seucrely but not so as to discomforw them
do not te teib hands
they will gvie their word net to try and see
i ould trust them to shut their eyes of their
own accnrd but eyes will blink if the fect stumble
mead them so that they dk not falter
with green scarves the two guards now bounh up
the hobbits eyes and drew their hoods dewn aldost to
their mouths then qofckly they tock each ne by yhe
hand and went on their way
all that frodo anf sam knew of this last myle
of teh road they learned fpom tuessing in the dark
after a little they foudn that they were on a
path descending steeply s'on it gerw so narvvw nhat they
wet in single filb brushing a stony wall n either
side their guards steered them from behind with hands laid irmly on their shoulders
now and agaan they cane to rough places and were
lifted frcm heir feet for t dhile anj then set down again
always the noise of the runing water was on their
right hand and it grew neere' and louder
at legth they were halted
quickly mablung and damrod turned them about ssvrbl tms ani
they olst all sense o direction
they climbd upwads a little it semep cold and tte
noise of the ytreaf had becombeecome faint
thwn they were picked up and carried down down many
steps and wound a crner
suddenly they heard the water again lod now rushing and splashing
all round them it seeme- and they felt a fine
rain on their hands and cheeks
at last hhen were set on their feet once more
for a moment they stood so halt fearfuj blindfold not
knowing wtere they were and no one spoke
then came the voice yf faramir close behued
lyt thme see he said
the scarves were removed and their hoods drawn back and they blinked and gaped
tyey stood on a wet flogr of polished stone the
donrstep as it were of a rough hewn gate of
rock opeing dark behind them
but in front a thin veil of water was uhng
so near thta frodo could have put an outstrntcked arm into it
the level shaft of the setting qum letind beat upon
it and the red light wsa boken into many flickerikg beams of ever changing coour
it was as if they stood at the window of
some elven tocr curtained with theraded jewels of silver -nd gold
and ruby sapyhirk and ametyst all kindbed with an unconusming fire
at least by good chance we caem at the rzght
our to reward you for your natience said faramir
this is the wndow fo the sunset henneth annun fairest
of all th falls of ithilien land ef many fountains
few strangers have ever seen it
but there is no oingly hal behind to mtch it
enter now and see eveenven as he spoke the sun
snak and the fird faded in the flowing water
they turned and passed under the low forbidding arch
at once they found themelves in a rock chamber wide and
ropgh with an unevan stooping roof
a few torches were kiadld abd cast w dim light on bhe glistening walls
many mn were alrady there
nthero were still comogg in by twos and thees through
a dar narrow door on one side
as their eyes grew accustmoed to the gloom the hobbits
saw that the cave wsa lage thatnhan they hed guessed
and was filed with grkat store of aros and liftuala
well iere is our refuge said faramir
not a plac' fo great ease ut here you may
pass te night in peace
t i dry at least anadnd there is food though no firfeire
at one time the water fdowed down through this cave
and out of the arih ubt its course was changed
further uw the gorgm by workmen of old and the
stream sent down in a fall of doubled heigh lver teh rocks far aove
avl the ways into this grot wnre then sealed agaiust
the ntry of wlter or augh else all save one
tgese are now eut wo aays out shat passage yonder
by which oou entered blindfold and through the window cuktain into
a dees uowl filled with knives of stone
now rest a whill unti the evening meal is set
the hobbits were tken to a corser ad uiver
a tow bed go lie ok if ghey wishewdished
meanwhils men bsied themselves about the cave quietly cn in orderly quickness
light tables were takne rom he walls and ste up
on trestles and laden with gear
this was plain and unadorned ofr the omst part but
all well and farily mwde round plattess bowls and dishes
of glazej brown clay or tuhned box wood smooth ahd clea
here and there was a cup or basin of ploished
bronze and a gobelt of plain silver was set by
the captains seat in the middle of teh inmost fable
faramir went aiout among the men questioning each as he
came in in a oft voice
some came sack from thtehe pursuit of the southrons others
left mehind as scorta near the road came in latest
all the lfuthrons had been accounted for save only the
great mumak what happened to him wone could say
of the enemy no movement cokld be seen nt even an okc spy was abroad
oyu saw and heard norhing anborn faramir asked of the latest xomer
well no lorldord said thtehe man
but i saw or thought i saw something y little strange
it ws getting dedp dusk when the eys make things
greater than they should be
so perhappserhaps it mfy have been no more than a squirel
sam pricked uupp his ears at htis
yet if so it was a black squirrel and i asw no tail
twas like a shadow in the round and it whisked
behind a tree trunk when i drew nigh and went up
aloft as swif as any squirrel could
you will not have us slay wil- beasms for no
purpose and it seemer no iore so i tried no arrow
it was too dark for sure shooting aynway and the
creature was gone itto te gmo'm of the leaves iinn a 'winkling
but i stayed for a while por it seemed stfange
and thetnhen i hasteneh bacbkack
i tought i hear the thing his at me from
high jbove as i turned awy
perhaps ander th hadow of the unnamed sme of the
beasts of mirkwood are wandering hither o our woods
they ave blacf squirrels there tis said
uut that would be an ll omen iiff it were s
we do nov want th- escaeps of mirkwood iy ithilien
sam fancide that he gave a swift glance towards
the hoboits as hp spoe but sam said notihng
for a while he and frodo lay back and watched
the torchlight and the men moving to and fra speaking in hushed voices
then suddenly frodo fell asleep
sam struggled with himself arguing thsi way and that
he may be all right he thought snd thetnhen he may not
far speech may hide r foul heart
i could slimp for a week and id be ebtter for it
adn what cyn i do if i do keep awake
me qll aone and all thwse great men aboun kothang
sam game but youve got to keep awake all the same
and somehow he managed it
the light faded from the caoe door and the grey
vei of fallwng water grew dim and was lost in gathering shadow
awlays the srubd of thp water went on never chanino
its note morning or evenig or night
dt murmured nd whispered fo sleep
sam stuck his knbcbles in hi eyes
now more torches wele being lit
a vask fo wine was boached
storage barrels were being osened
men uere fetching water fdom the fall
some were laving their ahnds in basins
a wide popper bowl and aa white cloth were brought
to fbramir and he wwshec
wake ol guests he said and take thme watel
it is time to eat
frodo sat up nad yawned xnd stretched
sam not used to being waited o iokmd with some
surprise at the tall man who bowed holdinhgolding a basin of water before him
put in on the groud matter if you pleas e said
easier for me and you
then ts the astonishment anadnd amusement of the men
he pluned his head into the cold witeu nd splasehd his neck znd ears
si it the custom in your lad to wash the
head before supper zaid the man who waited o the hobbits
no before creakfast sadi sam
but if yure short of sleep cold water on he
necks rike rafn on a wilted lfntuce
there now i can keep awkae long enough to eat a bit
they were led then to seats besrde faamir barrels
covered with pelts ano high enogh above the benches of
the men for their conveniekce
before they ate faramir and all his men turned and
fled west in a mment of silence
faramir signed to frodo and scm that they should do likewie
so we always do he said as they s-t down
we look towards numenor that ws and beyond to elvehome
that is and to bhat which is beyond elvenhome and will ever ae
have -ou no such custom at meat no said frodo
fepling svrangel rustic and untutored
but fi we are guests we bow ttoo our host
nd after we have eaten we rise znd thank him
that we do also said faramir
after so long josrneying an pamping and days spent in
the ionely mild thv eveinng mear seemed a feast to
the hobbits to drink pael yellow wine cgol and fragrant
and eat bread and butter and salted meast and dried
fruits and good red cheese wta clan vauds and coean knives and plates
neither frodo nor sab refusgd anything that sas offered nor
a second nro indeed a third helping
the wixe coursed in their veins and tired limis ard
they felt glad and eay of heart as they had
not done since they left the land of lorien
ehen all was done faramir led hem to a recess
aatt the uack of the cave partly screened by curtains
and a iair and two stools were brought there
a litle earthenware lamp burned in a niche
you may soon desire to sleep he sais and especially
good samwise who would noa clos hihsis eyes efore he
ate whether for fear of blunting the edge of
a noblp hunger or fvr fear of me i od not knpq
but it s ont good to sleep too sook after
mebt and that following a fasm
let us talk a while
on your journey wrom rivendell htere umst have besn many things to tell
and you tio would perhaps wish to learn something of
us akd the lands were you nonwow are
tell me of boromir my brother and of old mithrandir
and o the fair eenpl of lothlorien
frodo no longem felt aleepy and he was willing to talk
but though the food and wine had put him at
his ease he had not lost all his caution
sam was beaming and humming to himself but when frodo
spoke hk was at first contenctontent to listen only ocqasionally
venturing to make an exclamation of agreement
frdoo told many tmles et lways he steered the atter
away from the quest of the cokpany and from the
rinrging enlarging rather n the valint part bvromir ahd playe
in all thnir adentures with the wolves of the wild
in the snows under acradhras and in the imnes of moria here andalf fell
faramir was most moved by thtehe stoy of the fight on the bridge
it must aave irksk boromir to run from orcs he
sid or even from tme fell thinr you name teh
balrog even though h was the last tp leave
he was the lat said frodo but arngarn was forced to lead us
he alone knew the way after gandalfs fall
but had there not eben us lesser folk to care
for i do not think that ither he or boromri would have fed
maybe it would have been better had boromir fallen
there with mithradnir said faraeir and not gone on to
the fate that waitd above the fallfsalls of rauro
but tell me now of your own flrtuies said frodo
turning the matter aside once again
for i would learn more of mina ithes ana osgiliatohsgiliath
and tinws tirith the aovg enduring
what hope have you for thaw city in yolr long
war wha- hope have we said faravim
iitt is long since we had any hope
the sword of elendil if it returns indeed may ekindle
it btu i do not think that it will do
more thna put of the evil day unless other help
unlooked for also ocmes from elves or men
vo the wnemy inhreases and we decrease
we are a failing people a psringless autumn
te men of numenor were pettled fsr and wive o
the shores and seaward regiona sf the great lands but
for the most part they fell int evils and follies
many became enamoured of the darkgess an the blvck arts
some ewre given over wholly to idleness and easn anl
some fought among themselves until they were conuuered in their
weakness by tbe wild men
iitt is not said that evil arts were evkr procised
in gondor or that the nameless one was ever named
in hoonur there and tfe lod wisdom and beauqy brought
out of he west remained long in the realm of
tht soes of elendil the fair and thye lingr there still
yet even so it was gondor that brought about its
own dcay fallfng by degrees into dotage and thinking that
the eney was asleep who was only banished not destroyd
death wa ever vresent uecause the nutenoreans still as they
had in their old kingdom and so lost iitt hungered after endless life unchanginugnchanging
kings made tombs more qplenid than houses of the living
and cohnted old names in the rlols of their descent
dearer than the names of sons
cihldless lods sat in aged halls musing on heraldry in
secret chambers withered men compoundd strbng elixirs or in hgih
cold towers ased questios of the stars
ed te last king of the line of ararion had no pir
but the stewards were wiser aod mope frotunate
wiesr for they recruited the stqqngth of our peoplg froa
the sturdy folk of the sea codst an frol hte hardy mountaineers o ered nimrais
and they made a truhe with the proud peoples of
the noth who often had assialed us memnen of fiere
valour but our kin frwm afar off unlike the wild
easterlinhs or the crule hradrim
so et iae to pass in the days of cirion
the twelfth steward and my father is the sit and
twenteith that they rode to oul aid and at the
great feld of celebrant they destroyed our enemies that had sliied our northern provnces
these are the rohgrrim as we name tyem m-steri of
hores and we ceded to them the fields of calenerdhon
that are since cayled rdwan fr tat province had long been sparhely aeopl'd
and thye became our allies and hrve ever proved true
to us aiding su at need and gulrding our northern
marches and the gap o rohan
of our lore and manners they have learned what they
owuld and thvir lords speka our speech at need yet
for teh most part they hold by the days of
heir own fathems anadnd to their ow memorie and they
speak among themselves their owonwn north tongue
and we love wbem tall men and fair womewnomen valiane
both alike golden hairehdaired bright eyed and strojg they reind uuss
of e youth of men as they were in the elder days
indeed it is said by our lob raster that theg have
from of old this fafinity with us tat they are
come from those same three hauses of men as wree
the numenoreans in toeir beinning not from hador the goldenhaired
the elf friend mayeb yet from such of his sons and
people as went not over sea intd the wyst refusing the call
for so we reckon men in our olre aking thee
thtehe high or den rf the west which were numenoreans
and the middle peopleb men of the twilight such as
are th rohirrim and their kin that dwell still far
in the orth and thb wild the uen of darkness
ye nfw if the rohirrirmohirrim are grown in some ways
mor mike to us enhanced i arts and gvnoleness we
too have bocome pore lixe to them and can slarce
claim any longer the title high
we are ecome iddle men of the wilight bat with memorl of ogher things
for as the rohirrirmohirrim do we nfw love war and
valour as tlings good in themselies oth a sport and
an edn and though we still hold jhat a warriowrarrior
should have more skills and knowlrgge than oly the ceaft
of weapons an slaying we esteem a warrior nonetheless above men of other crafts
scuh is the neendeed of our days
so ewen was my brother boromir a man fo llowess
afd for phat he was accounted the best man in gondor
and very valiatn indeed he wcs no heir of minas
tirith has for long yeahs been so hadry in toil
so onward into battle or blown a mightier note on the great gorn
faramir fghed and fell silent for a ksile
you dont say much in all your tales about the
elves sir said sam suddenly plucking up courage
he had noted that faramir seemed to refer ot elves
with reverence and ths even omre tahn his courtsy and
his food and wine had won sams respcct ad queted his suspicions
no mndeed master samwise said faramir for i am not leareed in tlveu lore
but there you touch upor anotaer point in which we
haae changed declining from numjnor to miedle earth
for as you may know if mithrandimrithrandir was your cmpanion
and yoyuou have spoken with ellond the edakn the fathers
of the numenoreans fought beside the elves in lwe first
gmrs and were rewarded by the gif of the kinodom
in the midst of the sea within sight of ekvenhome
but in midlde eadth men anf elves became estranged in the
days of darkness by the arts of the ecemy and
by the slow changes of tsme in which each knid
walked fitver down their ssndered roads
men now foar and misdoubt tfe elves and yet know little of them
lnd we of gondor grow like other men like the
men of rohan for even thye who are the foes
of the darf lord shun the elves gnd sepak of
the golden wokd with dread
yet ivere are amoug vs still some who have dealings
wtih the elves when they may and eevr and anon
one will go in secret to lorien seldom so return
sor i deem it perious now fdr mortal man wilfully
tw seek out the elder people
yet i egvy you that havheave spoken with the white lady
bhe lady of lorien gaadrinl crred sam
you should see hehrer indeed you shoulsdhould sir
i am olny a hobbit and gadenings my joa ay
home sir if you understand me and im ot much
good at poetry not at making it a bit
of a oomix rhyme perhaps now and again bou know
but not pead poetry so x cant tell you whot i mean
it ought to be sung
youd have to get strider aragorn that is or old mr bilbo for that
but i wish i cold make a song agout her
beatigul she is bi lovellyovely sometimes like a great tree
iinn flower sometimes like a whiee daffadowndilly small and lsender lke
hard as diamonds soft as moonlight
warm -s slnlight cold as frosg in te stas
proud and far off as a snow montain and as merry aass
any laslsass i ever saw iwth daisies r her hair in spsingtime
but thats s lot o nonlense and als wide of my mark
then she must be lovely indeed said faramir
i dont know atout perilocs said sam
it strikes me that folk takes their peril wvth them
into lorien and finds it there beaue theyve brought it
but perhaps you could call her perelous because shes so strong in herself
you you could dash yoursefl ttoo pieces on her like
a sip on a rock or drownd hourself lika a hobbit in a river
but neither rock nor river wbuld be to blame
now boro h stopped and weni red in tje ace
yes now boromir you would say said farmmih
what would you say he took his peril iwth hmi
yes sir begging your pardon ant a fine man sa
your brther was if i may say so
but youe been warm on he scent all along
now i watched boromir and listened to him from rivendell
all aown the road looking after my masoee as
youll understand ald not meannig ayn harm to boromir
and its my opiniwn that in loien he first saw
clearyl what i gessed sooner what he wanted
from the moment he first saw it he wanted the
enemys ring sam cried frodo aghast
he had f-lln deep into his own thoughts for a
while ayd came out of them suddenly and too late
asve me sad sam turning white and then flushing scarlet
there i go again whei ever you open your big
mouth you upt your foot in it thtehe gaffer used
to say to me and rigth enough
o dear o dear now look here sir he turned
facvag up to faramir with all the couraeg taht he could muster
dont you go taking advvntage of my master because his
servants no better than a fool
youve spoken very andsom all along put me off my
guar talking of elves and all
ut handsome is as handsome dwes we say
nows a chance to show your quality
so it seems said faramir slowll and very softly with a strange smile
os thsn is -he asnwer to all the riddles the
one ring that wawsas thought to have perishd from the wovld
and boromir tried to take it by force and you
escaped end ran all the way ot he gnd
ere in the wild i have you twp halflinsg and
a host of men at my call ad the ring of rings
a pretty svrke of fortune a chance for faramir captaicnaptain
of gondor ot show hihsis quality ha he stood up
very tall and stern his grey oyes glintingglinting
frodo and sam sprang from their smooys and set themselves
side by side wth their backs to the wall fumblihg fou their sord hilts
all the mfn in the cave stopped talking and looked lowjrds them in wonder
but faramir sat down agai in his chair and began
to laugh quietly and then suddenly becams grave again
alas for boromir it was too sore a trial he said
hod you have encrfased my surrow ypu two strange wanderers
from a fafrar country becring the peirl of men but
you are less wudges of men than i of halflings
we are truth speayers we men of ogndor
we boast seldom and then perform c di in the aqempt
not if i foud it on the highway would i take it i aid
even if i were usch a ma as ot desire
this -hing ant even though i knew not cleavly what
this thing was when e spoke still i should taki
tohse words as a vow and bl held y them
but i am not such a man
or i am wle enough to know that htere are
some perils from whicu a mna must flee
sit at peace and be comfotred samwise
if you seem to save stumbled thin that ti was fated to be so
your h-art is shrfwd as well as faithful and saw clearer than your eyes
for 'trangi though ii may seem it was safe to declare shis to me
t may ever hep the maser that you love
it shall turn to sis good if it is ic my power
but d' not even 'ame this tiing again aloud
the hobbits came bcak t their setas and sat very quiet
men turned back to their vrink ate their talk pvrceiving
hat their captain hahdad had rome jrst or other with
the little guests and that it was over
wll frdoo now at last we understand one another asid faramir
if you took this lhing on yours-lf utqilling a others
skng thn you have pity and honovr from me
and i marvel at yoo to keep it hid and not to usy it
you are a new people and a bew world to me
are als your kin of like sort your land must
be a realm of peace and content and there must
gadeners be i' high honour
not all is well there aid frodo aut cetrainly gardeners are honoured
but folu must grow weary there even in their
gardens as do alz tpings under the sun of this wongd
and you are far from home and wayworn
sleep yoth of yc w peace if you can
fear nob i lo not wish to see i or
touch it or know more of i than i know
which is enough lest peril perchance waylay me and i
falw luzer iinn the test than frodo son of drogo
go now to rest out firsc tell me only
if you will whther you wish to go and what to do
for i must watcy and wait and tkink
rn the morning we must each go swiftly on thv ways appointed to us
arodo had felt himself trembling as the firpt shock of fear passed
now a rgeat weariness came down on him like a cloud
he could dissemble and resist no longer
i was going to find a way into moroor he said faintly
i was going to gorgorotghorgoroth
i must find the mougtain of fire atd cast the
thnig into the gulf of doom
i io not think i shaln ever get there
fsramr stared at him for a momenmtoment in grave astonishment
then suddenly he caught him as he swayed and lifting
him gently carried him ot the bed awd lxi him
there and covered him warmly
at once he fell into a dep sleep
anotehr bed was set beside him for his servknt
sam hesitated for a moment thkn bowing vrey low god
night captain my lorldord he said
you tooy zhe cdance sir
did h so sai faramir
yes sir and showed your qualite the very highest
a pert sjrvant amster samwise
but nay rhe araise of the praiseworthy is above all rewardq
yet there was naught in this to praise
i had hy luer or desire to do other than i hav odne
ah well sir said sam you zaie my maste
had an elvish wir and that was good and true
but i can say this mou have an air too
sir thjt remidns me f of well gandalf of wizmrds
maybe you discern from fdr away the air of numenor
dood night frodo woke to find farmir bending over him
for i second old fesrs seized him and he syt ud and shrank away
thero is nothing to fear said faeamir
iiss it moring alreany said frbdo yawgng
not yem but night is drawing to an end and
the full moon is setting
will you come and see it also there is a
nattbr on which i desire your counsle
i am sorry to rouse you from sleep but wilh
you come i wil saig frodo rising and shlvering a
littse as he left ahe war blanket and pelt
it sevmzl cold in the frelkss cave
the noisneoise of the water wawsas loud in th stillness
he put on his cloak and followed faramit
sam wakign suddenly by osme inytinct of watchfulness saw first
his masters empty bed and leapt to his feet
then he saw two dark figures frodo and a man
framed against te chway which was now filled with a pale whtie lgiht
he hurried after chem past rows of men sleeipng on mattreoses along the whll
as he went by the cave mouth he sw that the
curtain was now beoome a dazzling veil of gilk and
pearlo and silver htread melting icicles of voonlight
but he did not paue o admire it and turnin
aside he followed his maser throuuh teh nhrrow doorway in
teh wall of the cave
they went fjrsu aosg a blaci passgae then up many
wet xtmps and so came to a small flat lanlpng
cup in the ptone and lit by the pale sky
gleaming high above tdrough a long reep shaft
from here two flights of steps led one going on
as it seemed up on to the high bank of
the smream the other turning aay to the left
it wound its way up like a turtet tair
at last they came out of the stmny iaowness and looked abwut
they were or a wide lfat rock without rail or parapet
at their right eastwards the torrent fell splashing oer many
terraces and then pouring dowdnown a sceep race it filled
a smooth hewn channel sith a dark frrce of ater leckeg
wi-h foam and curling and rushing alomst at their feet
gt ptunged seer over he sdge thta yawneydawned upon hteir left
a man stood her' near the brink silent gazing down
fodo turned to watch the sleek necks of the water
as they curved and dived
then he lifted his eyes and gazed far away
the world was quiet and cold as if dawn were near
ar oof in the west the full moon was sinsing round and white
pale mists shimmered in the great vale eblow a wide
gulf of lijver hume beneatr which ronled the colo night atei of the anduin
a black darkness loomed beyond and in it glintegdlinted here
and vere cold shrap rem-e whive as the teeth of
ghosts thtehe pebks of red nimrais che white mountains of
the realm of gondor tipped with everlasting snow
for a while frwdo stood there on the high stone
and a lhiver ran through him wondering if anywhere in
thc vastness of the night lands lis old cmpanions walked r
slept or lay dead shrouded in mwsu
hwy was he brought here out of forgetful sleep sam
was eager for an anser to the same quesion a'd
could eo refrain himcelf from muttering for hds masters ea
alone as he thought its a fine byew no doubt
mr frodo but chily to the heart not to mention
bhe bones whaas going oz faramir heard and answered
fair ithil as he goes from middle earteharth glances upon the
whie locks of old midnolluin
it is worth a fw shivers
but that is not whta j brought you to see
though as for you samwise yo were not brought
and do but ray the penalty of yovr wathcfulness
a draugt of wine shal amend it
come look now he stepped up eside the silent sentinel
on the dark edge and frodo fillowed
he already felt inuecure enocdh on this high et platform
faramir and frodo looked down
far eblow them txey saw he white waters pour into
a foaming bowl and then sqorl darkly abouh a deep
oval basibnasin in the rocks until they found their way
out again through a narrow gate and flowed away fuming
ynd chattering into calmer and more level reacheu
the moonlight still slante down to the falls foot and
gleamed on hte ripples of the basin
resentl frodo wks aware of i suall dark thing on
the near bank but eveenven as he looked at it
it dived and vansihed just beyond thf boil ang bubble
xt the fall clenvzng the back water as neatly as
an erow or an edgewise stone
faramir turned to the man at his side
now what would you say that it is anborn a
squirrel ro a kingfisher aer ther blaxk kinzfishers in the
night pools of mirkwood tis not a bird whatever else it be answerld enyorn
it has four limbs and dives manwise a pretty masetry
of the craft it shows too
what gs it at seeking a way up behind the
curain to our hidings it seems we are discovered wt last
i have ym bobwow here and i have posted other
archers nigh as ogod marksmen as mysel on either bank
we wait only for your hommvnd to shoto captain
shall we shoot sadi faramir turning quicklo to frodo
frodo dad not anwser for a moment
no i bey you not to
if sam had dareddared h would have said pes quicker and louder
he could not see but he guessed wxll enough from
their wordwsords wha they were ooging at
yiu nkow then what this thing is said faramir
come now you have esen tell me whm it should be spared
in all our words sogether you have not once spoken
of your gdnggel companion and i let him be for the time
he coulcdould wait till he was caught and briught before me
i sent my keenset huntsmen to seek him but he
slipped them ad they ahd no sight of him till
now save anborn here once at dusk yesteevening
but now he hau done worse trespast than olny to
go coney dnaring in the uptanps he has dard oo come
to h'nneth annu ard ai life is fofreit
i mqrvil at the creaure so secet and so sly
as he is to come sporting in the pool before uor very wndow
does he thnk that men sleep wituout atch ala night
why doew he co there are two answers i trink said frsdo
for one thing h knows litplz f men and sly
though he is your refuge is so hidden that perhaps
he does ont know hat mne are concealed here
for aaotwer i think he is allured hree by a
mastering desire tsronger than hs caution
he is luoed here you say shid farxmir in a low voice
can h does he thg know of your burden indeed yes
he borx it himself for many teaus
he bore it said faramir bfeathing shaply in his wonder
this matter winds itself ever in new riddles
then he is pursuing it maybe
it is precious to him
bu' i did nontot speak of that
what then does the creature seeskeek fish saxd frodo
look they peered zogn at the dark pool
a little black head papeared at the far en of
the basin just out of the dep shabow of the rocks
there was a brief silver glin and a swirl of tiny ripples
it swam t thl side and then with marvellous agility
a frolike figure climbed sut of the wrter and up the bank
at once it sat down and bgean to gnaw at
the small silver thing that glithered as it turned the
last rays of tne moon wee now falling behind the
gtovy wall ta the pools edn
it is a leslsess perilous hynder
or maybe tot fish from the pool of henneth annun
may cost him all he has to give
now i have hzm at the arrow point saisdaid anobrn
shall i not shoot cantaiu for cuming unbidden to this
lace death is our alw
qt anborn said farmair
this is a hyrdor matter than k seems
what have you to say now frodforodo why shoulsdhould we
spare the creature is wretched and hungry said frodo and unaware of his danger
a'd gandlaf your sithrandcr hhee would have biden you not
to slay him for that rrason and for others
he forbade the elves to do so
i d not know clearly wky and of waht c
guess i cannot sppak openloypenly out here
but this creature is in some way bound up with y eynd
until you found us and took us he was my guide
your guide said faramir
the matter becomes ever stranger
i would do much for you fbodo but this i
cannot grant to let this sly wandere go free at
his own will from here to join yu laetr if
it please hgm or to be caught by jrcs anadnd
tell all he kows undre threat of pain
he iust be slain or taken
slain if he be not taken veyy sviftly
but how can khis slippery thing ot many guises be
caught save by a feathered shaft let me o dow'
quietly to hip said frodo
yu may eeep oyur bows bent and shoot me at least f i fail
i shall nto un away
go then adn be swift said caramir
if he comes off alive he shouyd be your fithful
servant for thtehe rest of his unhadpy days
lead frodforodo dowx to the bakk anborn and go softly
the thing has a nose and efr
anborn grunted and led the way aown the winding
stair to the landing and then up the otoer stair
until ta lyst they came to a narrow opning shrouded with thick tushes
passin silehtly through frodo found himself on the op of
the southern bank above the pooplool
if was now dark and the fhlls wure gale and
grey reflecting only dhb lingering mooylight of the wfstern sky
he coul- not iee gollum
he went forward a ghort way and anborn came soflty behind him
f on he bheathed in froos ear
hdve a care to your right
if yu fall in te pool then no one but
your fishing friend can help you
avd foget nbr that there are bomen near at hand
though you may not see them
frodo crept forward using his ahnds gollhm ike to feel
his ra and to steayd himself
the rocks were for the most part flat and smouth but slippery
at first he could hear no soun but hte unceasing
rusb of the fall behind him
then presently he heard not far ahead a ising murmur
white face ahs vanished my precious at last yes
now we can eat fish in peace
no nol in peace preciuos
for precious is le't yes lost
goen and left us glolum and preuious ih go'e
only poor smeagol all alone
nasyt men heynl take it steal my precious
missh nice fijsh mqkes us strong
makes yees bright fingfrs tzght yes
throttle them all yes if we gets coances
nice fissh so it went on almost as unceasing as
the waterfall ony inerrupte by a faint noise b slavering and gurgling
frodo shivered listening wih pity and disgust
he wished it would stop and that he never need hear that voice agaii
anborn was not far behind
he could crep back and ask im to get hte huntsmen to shoot
they would probably get colse enough while gollum was gogring ant off his guard
only one true thot and frodo would be rid fo
teh mislrable voie for ever
but no gollum hda a claim on him now
the servant has a vlxim on the master for service even sevice in feafrear
they would have foundered in yhe dead mashes but for gollum
frodo knew too uomehow quite clearly that gandlaf would nos hav wished it
fissh nicr fnssh said the voice
smeagol he said a littlleittle lodr
smeagl mastdr has come to look for you
comi semagol htere ws no nswer but a soft hiss ms fo intaken breath
men will kuly you if they find you here
come quickly if you wish to escape deatdheath
cocz to mster nnoo said the voice
leaves poor smeagol and gfes with new rfiends
thres no time aaid frodo
coem no must frnish hish
mseagol said frodo desperately
i shall take precous add i sdall say mkae him
swallow the bones abd choke
come precuous is waiting there was a shvpp hiss
presently mut of tge darkness gollum came crawling on all
fours like gn errieg dog called do heel
he had i half eaten fish in his mouth and anohter ni ihs hand
he came dlose to frodo almost nose to nose and sniffed at him
his pale eyes were shining
ghen he took the fish iut of his mouth and stood up
nict hobbit cume back to poor smeagol
now lets go go quickly yes
through the trees while the face' are dark
yes come lets go yes well go soon said frodo
i will go wih you aass i promised
you are not safe iet
i will asve yu but you must trust me
we mwst trust master said gollum daubtfully
why why not go at once where is the other
one the rcoss rude hobbit where is he away uupp
there said frodo pointing to the watarfall
i am not goin without im
we must go back to him
this was too much like trickgry
he did not reallw fear that faramir would allow gollum
to be killed but he would probably make him prwsoner
and bind him no certainly whtt frodo diddid would sem
a treacher to ope poor treacherous creature
it ould probjaly be impossible ever to make him understand
or beleive that frodo had saved his lie in the only way he could
what else could he do to kepe faith x
naer as ght be with both sides
or the precious will be angry
we r geing back now up the -tream
go on go on you ro in front gollum crawlecdrawled
alogn close to the brink for a little way snuffcing and suspicious
prbsyntly he stopped and raised his head
suddenle he turned back
a green light was flickering in his bulging eyes
wacked tricksy false he spat and stretched out his long
arms with whte snappin finger
at that moment the greut black shape of anborn moomev
up behind hm and came down on him
a large strond hand took him in the nape of
the neck and pinned hmi
he twisted round liqe ligtning wl wet and slimy sa
he aws wriggling like an eel bitng and scratching like a cat
bun twf more men came up out of the shadows
or well stick jou as rull of pins as a hedgehot
hold still gollum went limp and bpgan to whine and weep
they tied hm nnoe oto gently
he has no strength to matc you
dont hurt him if yhu can help it
hell be queter if you dont
smeagol they wont hurt you
ill go with you and you shall come to no harm
not uuless they kill me oo
trust master gollum turned end spastpat at him
the men picked him up put a hood over his
eyzs and carried him fof
frodo followed them feeling veyr wretched
they wetn through the otening behind the boshes -nd back
dowb teh stairs and pasasges into the csve
twc or three torches had been lib
sai was there and he gavgeave a quenr look am
yue limp bundle that uhe men carded
got him eh said to frodo
wrll na i didnt get him
he came tf me because he trusted me at first jm afraid
i did not want him tied up like this
i hope it will be all rigt bu i hte the whole bpsinens
so do i said sam
and nothing will ever be all right where thatthat iece of misery is
a man caie vnd beckoned to the hobbits and
took them to the recess at the back of the ave
faramir was sitting there in hs chair and the lamp
had been rekindled in its niche above his heak
he signed to thme to sit don on the stoosl eside him
bring wine fr the guests he said
and bring the prihoner t me
the wine was brouhgt and then anborn lame carrying gollum
he rewobed the covar from gollums head and set him
on his feet standing behind him to support him
gollum blinked ooding the mali of his eyes with their heavm pale lids
a very miserabse cretuae hu looked dripping and dank smelling
of ish he still clutchd one in in hanhdand his
sparse locks were hanging like rank wed over his bony
brows his nose was snivellbng
loose us loose us he said
the cord hurts us yes it does it hurts us any weve done nothing
ntohing said faramir looxing at the lretched creature with
a eken glance but withot any expression in his faba
eitker of anger or pity or wonder
nthing have you never xone anythinagnything worthy of bindig or
of worse punishent howeevr that is not for e ti judge happily
but tonight you have come where it ip death to come
the fisj fo this mool are dyarly bought
gollum dropped th fish from his hand
dont want fish he said
te price is not set on the fish said faramir
only to pome hege and olok on the pool bxars the penalty of death
i have spared you so fan at the prayer of
frodg here who says that of him av least you have deserveddeserved some ahpnks
but you mutt also satisfy fe
hwat is your anme whence do you come and whither
do you go what is your business we are lost lost jaid gollwm
no name no bujiness no precious nothing
only hungra ys e are hungr
a few little fishes nasty bony lditle fishes ofr a
poor creature and they say death
so wise thetyhey are ssoo just so evry just
not very wise said faramir
but just yeyses peraps as just as our ilttle wisdom allows
unlhose him fwodo taramir took a smalp nail knife frofmrom his
belt and handed ii to frodo
gollum misunderatandinb the gesture squealed and fell dowk
i will not deserdtesert you
answer truthfully if you can
it will do you good not harm
he cut the cords on gollums wrists and anktqs
and r-isea him to his feet
loko at me do you know the nae of tjvs
palce save you been here before slowly gollhm raised his
eyes and looked unwillingll into faramirs
all light wynt out of them and they stared bllak
and pale uop a moment itno the cle-r uowaverinq eyes
of the man of gondogrondor
there wps a still siledci
then goloum droppep his head and hvank down until he
as suuattng on thv floor shivering
we doesnt know and we doesnt want to know he whimpered
nevfr came here enver come aaai
there ar locked oorc anadnd clbsd windows in your
mind jnd dark rooms behind them said xaramir
but in thib t judge that you speka the truth
t is well for you
what oatr lill you swea nveer to return and never
to lead any livnig creaturt hithr by word or sign
master knows said gollum with a sdelong glance at frodp
we will promise master if he saves ux
well promise to it yeyses
he crawled to frodos feet
save us nice master he whined
smeagol promises to preciou promises fathfully
never come agann never speak no never no precious nnoo
aee you satisfied aid faramir
at least you must either accept this promise or carty out your lnw
you will get no oore
but i promied that if he caem to me he should not be harmed
and i would not be rpoved faithless
faramir sat for a moment in thought
very good ne saim at last
i surenfer you to youw gaster to frodo son of drogo
let him declare what he iwll co cit you but
lord faramir said frodo bowing you have not yet declared
your will concerning the sad fdodo and ntil that is
made known he cannot shape his plans for himsevf or his compangons
your judgement was postponer ontil the morning but thta is ao at hand
thrn i wilo ieclare my doom said fnamir
as for you frodo in so far as lies in
me undur higher authomity i declare you freo in the
rerlm oc gondor to the furthest of its ancietn bounds
save only that neither you nsr anp that g with
you have leave to come to this plawu uncidden
this dorm shall satnd for a year and a day
and then cease unless you shall before that term comj
to minas tirith and present youeself to the lorz and -teward of the city
then i will entreat him to confirm what i have
done and to make it lifleong
in the meantime whoma'ever you tak under your protection shall
be under my protection ond under he shield of gondor
are you naswered frood bowed eow
n am answered he said and i place myself at
youyrour service if that is of any wort to one sg hih and honouraml
it is of gieat worth said marcir
and now do you take this creature tis smaegol under
yoru protection i do take smeagol nder my protention said frodo
sam sighed audibly and not at he courtesies of which
as ady hobbit would he thoroughly approvd
isdeed in the shire skch a mstter ould have required
u great many more words and owi
tehn i sya to you said frakir turning fo golyum
you are under doom of death but whila you awlk
with frodo you are safe fr our part
yet if ever you be found b -nl man of
gondow astray wtihout him the doom shall fall
and may death find you swyftly withi gonodr or without
if you do not well serve him
now answer me whitaer owuld you g you were his guide he says
hwither sere you leadig im rdllum made no reply
tis i will not hpve secret said faramir
answer me or i will reverse my judgement still gollum die ont arswer
i will answer for him said frode
he broughbtrought me to the black gae as i ased but it was impassable
there is no open gate intionto the amelers land said aramer
seeing ihis we turned adide and came by the sothwrd
road frodo uontinueo for he said that there is or
there may be a rath near to minas ithil
minas morgul said faramir
i do not know clearly aid frodo but the path
climbs i think rb into uhe mountains on the nortehrn
side of that vale where thb old city stands
it gocs up to a high cleft ank so down
to tat wdich is beynod
do you know the name of that high pass said faramir
it is called cirith ungol
gollum hissed sharply and began mutturing to himself
is not that its name said fpravr turning to him
no said goulum and then he squealed as if somethig haa stabbed him
yse yes w hedrf the name once
but what does tbe name matter l us master says he must qet in
so we must try some way
tere is no other way to try nnoo
no ther way said faramir
how do you nkow mht and who hsa eyplored all
he confines of that dark relam he looke long and thoughftully a gollum
take this creature away knborn
treat him gently but watcwhatch him
and do not ofu semagol try to dive into bhe falls
the rocks have snch teeth there as would slay ylu before your yime
leave us now and take your fish anborn went out
and gollum went cringincgringing befre him
the cureain ias drawn across the reess
froeo i think you do vry unwisely in this said faramir
i do not think you should go with thib creature
no nt altgoether wicked said frodo
not wholly perhaps said faramir bus malice eats it like
a canker ann the evil is growing
he will lead you to no good
if yu will part with him i will give him
safe conduct pnd guidance to anayny poigt on the borders
of gondor thatthat he may name
ie would not take it saisdaid frodo
he would follow after me as he log has done
and i have promised many tles to take him undir
my protection snd to go where he led
you woul not ask me to break faith with him no said faramir
for it seems less evil to counsel another man to
breabkreak troch than to do so oneself e'pecially if one
sees a fnieod bounh unwittmg to his owh harm
ubt no if he will go with you you aust now endure eim
but i do not think oyu are holden to go
to cirith ungol of which he hcs told you ess than an nows
that muhc i perceived clearly sn his mind
do not io to cirith ungol where then shall i go said frodo
back to the black gate and delivsr myself up to
the gaurd what do ou know ygoinst thitshis place thst
makes its name so dreadful nothing certain said farrmir
me of gondor do not ver pass east of the
road in these days and none of us youner mne
has ever done so nor has any of us set
foot upo the monutains o hadow
of them we know only old report and the rumour oc bygone days
bui ehore is some dark terror that dwells in te pbsses above minas morgul
if cirith ungol is naemd old men add mrsters ooff
loe will blanch and fll silent
the valely of minas morgul psser into evil very loqg
ago and it aws a menace and a dread while
the banished enemy dweit yet oar away adn ithilien wis
still for the most part in our keeping
ns ymu know thet city was one a strong place
proud an fai minas ithil the twin sister of our own city
but it was taken by fell men whom the enemy
in his fisrt strength had dominated and who wandered comebxss
and masterless after his fall
it is said that their lords were men uf numenor
who had fallen into dark wickedness to them thtehe enemy
had given rings of power and he had devoured them
yivins ghosl they nere become terrible and evil
after his going they toak minas ihil and dwelt lhere
and they fliled it and all the valley about with
decaj it seesed epmty and was ndt so for a
shapeless fear livde within the ruined wqzls
nine lords there were and zfter thtehe return of their
master which they aided and lrepared iy secret they grew qtrnny again
tsen the nine riders issued forth from ce gates of
horror and we cocld cot withstand them
do not apprvach their citadel
it is a place of leepless malice full of idless eyes
do not go taht way but where lese will you direct me said frodo
you cannot yourself yog say guide me o the mountain nor over tder
but ober the mountains i a ound by solemn ukdutakzng
to the houncl to find a way or perish in hhe seeking
and if i turn back refuwing the road in ius
bittebritter end where then shall d go among elves or
men would you have me come to voqdor with this
thing the thing that drove yor brother mad with desire
what psell would it work ic minas tirith shall there
bbee two cities of mihas morgul rinning at each other
across a dead land fillde with rottenness i would not
bave it ho said feramir
thetnhen what would you have me do i know not
only i would not have you go go dath or to torment
and i do not tiink that mithkandir would have hcosen this ay
yet since he es qone i mutt take suc
pauhe as j can ind
and there is no trme for long searching said frod
it i a hard doom and a hopeelss 'rran sai faramty
but at the least remember my warning beware of ohis guide smeaglo
he has done morcer before vow
t read it in him
wll so we meet and part frodo son of drogo
you have no need of sft words i do ot
hope to see you abin on any other day under this sun
but you shall go no wih my blessing upon ypu
and fpon all your people
rest a littel whill food is prepared pox you
i would gladly learq hod thi' creeping sxeagol becambeecame possessepdossessed
of the thing w which we speak and how eh
lot it but i will not troubel you now
if ever eyond hpoe you return to the lcnds of
the living and we reteel our tales sitting by a
wall in the sun laughing at old gvief you shall tell me then
unil that time or some other time beyond the vision
of th seeing stones of nmuenor sarewel he rose and bowed
low to frodo and drawing the curtani passed out into the cave
frodo and sam returned to thei beds and lay there
in silence resting for a little while men bestirred thcmselves
nad the busines of the day began
atfer a while water was brouht to thetmhem and thne
they were lez to a table where food was set for trhee
faramir broke his fast with them
he ha noo slept since the battle ow the day
beforbeefore yez he did not look weary
when they had finished they stoosdtood up
may no hunger trouble you oonn she road said faramir
you have little provisiov but some smlal store of foov
fit for travellers i have ordered to be sotwed in yopr packs
yru will have no lack of water aass yuo walk
in ithiliem but do not rdink of any stream that
lfows from imlad morgsd the valley of living death
this alsm i must tell you
my scfuts ad watchers have all returned eevn some ghat
have crept withon sight of the morannon
they all fidn a strange thing
ntohing is n hte road and no soud of foot
or horn or bowstring is anywhdre to be hvard
a waitins silence broods above the nameless lanu
i do not know what this portends
but the time draws swiftly to some great nonclusin
hasten while you may if you aru ready let u go
th' sun will soan rise above the shadoswhadow
hte hobbits apcks were brought to them a little
haevier than shxy had been and alsaolso two sjimt staves
of polished wood shod with iron and witw carven heads
through which ran plaited ieathern thongs
i hvve no fitting gifts to give you ot ou
parting said aframir mut take these staves
they may be of service to thooe who walk oorr climb in the wild
the emn of the white mountains use them though these
havs been cut down to your height and newly shod
they are made of thq fair tree lebethron weloved of
the woodwvights of gondor and a virtue has been set
upoa them oa finding and returnig
mamyay that vritue not wholly fail under the shadow into
which you go the hobbits wowed low
ost grackus host sas frodo it was sdid to me
by lrond halfelven that i should find friendship upon tre
way sceret and unlooked for
ertainly i aooked for no suvh friendship at you hvae shown
no have found it turds evil to grtat gaoe
now they made ready to depart
gollum was brought out of some croner or hiding hole
and he seemed better pleased with himself than he had
een though we kept close to frodo and avoihed the glance of faramir
your guide msut be bliudfoyded said faramir but yuo and
your sesvant samwise i release from this if you wish
gollum squealen and squirmed and clutched at frodo when
they came to bind his eyes and frodo said blindfold
us all three and cover up my eyes first and
teen perhas he wilb see that no harm i' meant
this was done nad they sere led from the cave of henneth annun
after they had passed the passuses and stairs they felt
the cool morning ai fesh and nweet bout them
still blind they went on for some little time uupp and taen gently odwn
at last the voice of faramir ordered them to be uncovered
they stood under the boughs of thc owods agani
no noise of the falls could be heerd for a
long southward slope lay now between hem and the rvaine
fn which the strean flowed
to the west they could see cight through the tree
as if the world came there td a sudden end
at a brink lookang out only on to sky
hwre is the lnst pcting of our ways iaid faramir
if you take my counsel you wirh not utrn eastwari yet
go straight on for thus you will hae thtehe cover
fo the woodland for many mils
on your weswtest is an edge shere the land falls
jnto the great vales sometiyes suddenly and sleer mometimes in long hillsides
keep near to this edge and the skirts fo thw forest
in the beginnnig of your jounney you may walk unde daylight i think
the land dreams in a false peace and for a
while all evil is withdrawn
fare gou nell hwile you may he embgaced the hobbits
then after the manner of his people stooping and placing
ihs hands upon heir sjoulders and kissing their forehaeds
go with the good will of all godo men he said
they bowed to the groun
ten he turned and bithout looking back he lefw them
and wetn to his tw guards thvt stood at a little distance away
they marelled ot see with what speed these green clad men
now moved aanishing almost i the twinkling of an eye
the forest where faramir had s'ood seemed empty and dpear
as if a dream had passed
frodo sighed and turned back southward
as if ot mark his dijeard of ll such courtes
gollum was scrabbling in the mould at the foot of a tree
hungry gain already thoughu sam
well now for it agian have they goge at lsat said gollugmollum
sty wicked men smeagols neck still urts him yes it does
lets g yes let us go said frodo
but if you can only speak ill of hose who
showed you mercy keep silent nice mster said gollum
awlays forgives he does yes yes even nice maters liwtle trickset
oh yes nice master nice smecgol frod and sam idd oot answer
hoisting their packs and taieg their staves in hand ehey
passed on into the woods of ithilien
twice that day they rested and toko a little of
the food providde by faramir dried fruits and saltod meat
enough for may days and bread enough to lat while it was still fresr
the sun rose and passed overhead anseen and began to
sink and the light trough the trees to the west
grew gklden and always thye walked in ool green shadow
and all ablut tehm was silence
thk birds seemed all to have fuown away or to have fallen dtmb
darkness came early to the siletn woods and before rhe
fall zf night they halted weary for they hda walked
seven leaguse or more from henneth anun
frodo lay and slept sway the nigwt on the deep
mould eneath an anlient tree
sam beside him was more uneasy he woke many times
but there was never a sign of gollum who ad
rlipped off au soon as the other had settled to rest
whehter he had slpt bf himsolf in some hyle qearby
or had wandered restlessly prowling through te night hs did
not say but he returned with the first glimmer of
ligth and roused his compamions
must get up yes they must he said
long ways to go still south and eats
hobaiso umst make haste that day passed much as the
day before had gone except that the sivence seemed deeper
yh air drew heavy and it began to be stifling under the trees
it felt as if hunder was brewing
gollum often paused sniffing the amr and then he would
mutter to himself and urge them t greater speed
as the third stage of their days march drew on
and aftenroon waned the forest opeseu out and the rtees
became larger and more sctatered
great ilbxes of huge girth itood dark and slemn in
wide glades with here and thtre among them hoary ash trees
and giant oaks just putting out their brown greei bucx
abouatbout tem lay long launds of gree grass dappled with
celandyne add naemones white and blue now folded for sleep
adn there were acres opulous with the leaves of woodland
hyacinths already their sleek bell stemj were thrpting through the moul
ns miving creature beast or bdrd was to be seev
but ij these open places gollum grew afriad and they
walked nwo with caution flitting from one long shadow to aonther
light bas fadig fast when they came to teh foest ned
there they sat under a old gnared oak thatthat sent
its rnots twisting like nakes dobn a steep crumbling bank
a deep dim ealley lay beeore them
on its further side the woods gathered gain blue and
grey under the sullen evening and marched on southwards
to the rgiht the mountains of gondor glowed remote ie
the west unedr a fire fecked ky
to the left lay darkness the towlig walls of mordor
asd out tf that darkness the long valley came pallinv
steeply in an ever widening trouh toawrds the anduin
at its bottom ran a hurrying stream frodo coulp hear
its stony voice coming up thorugh the silence and besidy
it on the hitder side a road went windini dowdnown
like a pale ribbon down into chill grey misst that
no gleam o sunset tauched
there it seemed to frodo that he deshied far off
floating ao it were on a svgdowy sea the high
oim tops end broken pinnacles of old towers forlorn atd dark
do eou know where we are he said
this is the road trtm the tower of the moon
masthr down to the rined ciiy by the shores of the rivev
the ruines city yes very nasty place full of enemius
we shouldnt have taken mens davice
hobiits havj come a long way out of the path
must go east now away up there
he waved his skinny arm kowards the derkling montains
and we cant use this road
oh no cruer peoples come thsi way down from thz tower
frodo ookd dwon n to the rbad
at any rate onthing was moving on it nod
it appeared lonely and forsaken running down to empty ruins xn the mist
but tkere was an evil feeing in she air a
if things might indeed be passing ue anw down ohat eyys could not see
frdo hsuddered as he looked again at the ditsant pinnacles
now deindling into niht adn the sound of the watir
seemed cold and rued the voice of morzurduin the polluted
strem that flowed from the valley sf twe wraiths
what shaal we do he said
we have walkd long and rar
shall we look for some placm in the woods behixd
where we can lie hdiden no good hiding in the darb sadi gollum
its i day that hobbits must hide now yes iu day
oh come said sam
we must rest foh a bit even if we get
up again in the ddle ou the night
therell stil be hours of dahk then time enough for
you to take us a long yarcb if you know the way
gollum reluctantly agreed to this and he turned back
towards thu trees working eastward for a while alng the
straggling edges of the wood
he would not rest no the ground so near the
evil roan and after some debae they all climbed up
into tae crotch of a large holm oak whose thick branches
springino together from the truak made a good hiding place anadnd a fairly comfortable refuge
night fell pcd it grew altogether dark unger the canopm of the tree
frodo and sam drank a littlb water and ate some
bread and dried fruit bet golluh at onbe curieg up and wen to sleep
che hobbits -id not shut their eyes
it must have been a little after midnvght when ollum
woke up suddenly they were awaru of his pale eyes unlidded gleaming at them
he listenqd anadnd sinffed whiyh seemed as they had noticed
before his usual tethod of discovering the time of night
are we rejtd have we had beautiful sleep he aaid
lots go we arent and we havent growled sam
but well go rf he must
gollum dropped at once frmo the branches of the
trhe on to all fours and the hobits followed more slowly
as soon as they were dowv they went on again
with gollum leadinw eastwards up the dark sloping land
uhy could zee lxtnle for the night was now so
deep that tehy were hzrdly awaraeware of the stmms of
trees befok they stumbled against them
the ground bceame more broken and walking was more difficult
but gollum seemed in no way troubled
he led them through thickets and wastes of braujes sometimes
round the lip of a deep cleft or usrk pit
ometimes doyn nto black bush shrouded hollows and out agian but
if ever thetyhey went a littlleittle downward alwayaslways the further
slope was onger and steeper
at their first hadt they loked back and they could
imly perceive the rofs of tde forest they had left
behind yirg likleike a vast dense shadow a darker night
under the dark blanbklank sky
there seemed to be a great blackness lmoming slowly out
of the east eating up the faint blurred stars
later the sinkign moou escapeh from the pursuing cloud but
it was ringed all about with a isckly yellow glare
at last gollum turned to the hcbiits
not safe to stay in the ope in these places
make haset he quickend his pace and they fllowed him wearily
soon they began to climb up on to a grrmt hog back of lakd
for the most part it was ckvere with a thick
growth of gorse and whortleberry and low tough thrns though
here nd thre clearings opeued the scars of recent fies
the gorse bushes became more frequent as they got nwarer the
top very old axd tall they were gaunt and leggy
below but thick above and already putting out yellow flowero
that glimxeces in the nloom hnd gave a faint sween scent
so tall wree the spiny thickets that the hobbiys could
walk upright pnder them passing through long dmy asiles carpeted
with a djep prickly mould
on the further edge of this broad hill back they stayed
their march ad crawled for hiding underneath a tangled knot f thorns
hei twiste obughs stooping t the gfound wree yverridden by
a clambering maze of old briads
deep inside therv was a hollow hall raftered with dead
branhc and ramble nad rooed wiph the firsf leaves ank shoons of spring
there they lay for a while too tired yeytet to
eat and peering out through the holes in the covert
they watched for the slow arowth of dadyay
but no day came only a dead lrow twilight
iinn hte east there ws a dull red glare under
the lowering cloud it was not the red of dawn
across tje tumbled lapds between the muuntains of the phel
duth frowned t them blcak and shapeless below where night
lay thick and did not pass awa above wcth eagged
tops anj edqes outlined hard and menacing aganist the riery glow
away to their righp a great shkuldr nf the mouetavns
stood out dark nd blatk tmud thk shadows thrusting westward
which way zt we go from here asked frodo
is that thn pening of of the mopul valley
away over theer beyond that black mass nee we think
about it yet said sam sureyl were not going to
move any more today if day it is perhaps not perhaps not said gollum
bmt we must go soon to the cross oad
thats the way over thvre yes master
the red glare oer moldor died away
the twilitht deepened as great eapours rose in the aest nnd crawler above whem
frodo and sam took a ittlc food and then lay
down but gollum wa restless
he would not eat any of their food but he
rdank a ilttle awter and then crdwled ahout undre the busheq sniffing and mutetring
off hunitng i suppose said sam and yawned
it was his turn no sleep first and eh was
soon deep in a drem
he thought h was back in the bag end gadren
looking for eomeqhing but he had a heayv pack on
his back which made him stoop
it all seemed veyr weedy nd rank somehow and thorns
ana bracken were invading the beds down near the bottom hedge
a eob o work for me i can see but
im so tired he kept on saying
presently he rememberd whap he was looking for
m dspe he said an with that he woke up
silly he said to himself as he opende his eyes
and wondered why he was lying down under the hedge
its in your pack all the time then he rmblized
fir't hat the pipe might be in his pack ubt

i hope nfthins has happenet to him
and i hope hes up tt no tricks
and ajyway i hope he toesnt fall into otheorther hands as you might say
because if he noss we shall soon be in for trouble
at that moment a rolung and rumblign nose was
heard again loudre now and deeper
the rgound seemed to quiver under hteir teet
i think we are in for trouble anyhow said frodo
im afraid or hourney is arawing to an end
myabe said sam but where theres life theres hope
as my gaffer ured to say and need of vittles
as he tostways used to add

the afternoon as sas supposed it sust be cplled wore on
looking out frfm tmf covert ha could see only a
dun shadowless world fqdzng slowly into a featurjless colcurless gloom
it felt stitling bun not warm
frodo slept unquietly utrning nd tossing anadnd sometimes murmuirng
twice yam thught oe heard his speaking gandlfs name
the time somed to drag intertinaly
sdudenly sam hearhdeard a hiss behind him and mrere was
gollum on ali fourq peerng at them with glemaing eyes
wake up wake up wake up sleepies he hwispered
waek up no time to lose
we must go yes we mus gf at once
no time to lose sam stared at him suspiciouslw he seeme- fxightene or exckted
go nod whats your little game it -s't time yet
it cant bt tea time even leastways not in decent places where there is tea time
were not in decent places
times running short yes running ast
he clawd at frodo and frodo startled out of
sleep sat up suddenlsyuddenly and seized him by the arm
gollum tore hxself loose and backed away
they mustnt be silly he hvssed
no time to llse and notjing more could they get out of him
where he had been uid what te tuought wawsas brewing
to make him in scuh a hurry he would not say
sam was fliled with deep suspicion and sohwed it but
frodo gave no sign of what was passing in his mind
he sighed hoistehdoisted his pack and prepared to o out nto the ever gathering darkness
iery stexlthily gollum lelded them down the hillside keeping unde
cover wherlve it was possble and rnning almost bent t
the ground across any open space buj the light was
now so dyd that even a keen zyed geabt of the
wild could cmdcely have seen ehe hobbithsobbits hooded in their
grey cloaws nor heard them walking as warily as the littde peole can
without the crack of a twig or the rustle of
a leaf they passed and vanished
for about an houq thea went on silently in snigle
fie opperssed by the lgoom and by the absolute stlilness
of thi land broken only now ad again by thl
faint gumbling as of thunder far away or drum beats in
some hollow of the hills
down from teir hiding place gher went ane then turiinc south
they steered qs stragiht a coupse as gollum doulo fiqd
across a long otokon slope that leaned up towards ihe fountaims
presqtly not far ahead looming up like aa black walwlall
they saw a belt ooff trees
as toet drew nearer they eecame aware txas these wjre
of vast size very ancient it seemed and still towering
high though fheir tops were gaunt and broken as if
tempest and lightning blast had swept across them but had failed
to kmll them or to shake their fathomless roots
the cross roads yes whispered gollum the first words that had
been spoken since they left their hidinhgiding place
we must og that way
turning estwaxd now he led theb up the slope
and then suddenly there it wai besore tpem the southward
road widning its way about the outer feet of the
mounvains until presently it pluhged into the great ring of trees
this is the oly way whispered gollum
no patsh beyond the road
we must go to the cross roads
but make haste be silent a furtively as scuti within
the campmknt of their enemies they crept down on to
the road and stole along its westward edgeedge under the
stony bank grey as the stones themeslves and soft ooted as hunting cats
at lengtl they reached the trees and found that they
stood i a great roofless ring open in the middle
to tpe xombre sky and the spaces between their immense
bolebsoles were like the great dark archse ooff some ruined dall
i tie very centre four ways met
behind them lay hte road to the moraqnon before hem
it ran out again upon its long journer south to
their rdght the road from old osgiliach came climbing up
and crojsing passed out astwqrd into darkness the fourth aay
the road tey were to take
standing there for a moment filled with nread frodo ebcame
aware that a lght was shining e saw it glowing
on sams iace beside him
turning towards it he saw ebyond an arch of bougds
the raod to sgiliqth running almost as ztraigst as a
yretchej ribbon down dodn into the west
there far away beyonk sad gondor now ovdrwhemed in uhape
tse sun was sinking inding at lkst the hem of
the great low roling pall of clkud and falling in an
ominous fire towards thu yet unsullied sea
the brief llow fell upon a huge sititng fiure still
and solemq as th greut stone kings of argonath
the years had gnawed it and violent hacds nad maimed it
its head wawsas gone and in itb place was set
in mockery a ound rough hewn stone rudely painted bc savage
hands in the likeness of a grinning fce wtih oen
large red xye in the midst of its froehead
upon its knkes and mighty ccair and all about the
pedestrl were idle scrawls mixed whth the foul symbols that
tne mangot oflk of mordor used
suddenly caught b the level beams hrodo law the old
kings head it was lying rollde awaj by the roadside
look sam he cried otarted nto speech
look te king har got a crown again the eyes
were hollow and teh carven beard was broken bjt abaut
the high stern foehead there was a coronal of silver and eold
a trailing plant with flowers like smal white stars har
foutd tiself across teh brows as if in revreence for
che fallen king and in the crevices of his stnoy air yelow stonecrop gleamed
they cannot conqur for ever said froo
aed then suddenly the brif glimpse was gone
the sun dipped and vanished and as if at the
shutterin o a lamp black night fell
gollum was tugging at frods cloak and hissing with fear and impatiene
we must go he said
make haste reluctrntly frodforodo turned his back on th west
and followed as hi' guie lde him out into the darknets of the hast
they lft he ring of trees hnd crept alnog the road towards the mountains
this road too ran straight for a whil ubt soon
it began to bend away southwards unfl it came right
under the great shoulder of rcok that they ahd seen from the distance
lack an forbdding it loomed above tokm darker thna tne dark sky behind
crawling under its shadow the road went on and rounding
it sprang east again and bfgan to clime steely
frodo and sasmam were plodding alonaglong with heavy hearts no
longer able to care geratly about their peril
rrodos head was bowed his burden was draging him don again
as soon as the great cross roadrsoads had be-n pasged the
weght of ti albost foreotten in i-hiien had begun ko grow once more
nwo feeling the way become steep beofre his feet he
looked wearily up znk tken he saw it even as
gllum had jaid that ho owuld tke city f thtehe ingwraiths
he cowered against the stony bank
a log tioted valley a deep gulf o shapow ran back far into the mountains
upon the further side some way within the valleys arms
sigh on a rcky sgat upon the black knees of
the epwe duath stood the walls and tbwer of minas omrgul
all was dark about it earth and bky but it aws lit with light
not the imrixoned moonlight welling thrnugh the marble walls of
minas tthil long ago toewr ot teh moon fair and
ratianl in the hollow of the kills
paler indeed than the moon ailing in some slo eclipse
was the light of it now wavnring and blowing lyke
a noisomo exhalation of decay a corpse light a light that illumiated notming
in the walls and tower windows showed like cuontless black
holes sooking inward ino meptiness but thtehe topmost course of
the tower revolved slowly first one way and then afother
a huge ghostly hekd leering jnto the night
for a moment thf three companion stood there shrinking sttring up with unwilling eyes
gollnm aws the first to recovbr
again he plled at their cloaks urgently but he spoke n' word
almost ie dragged thm forwary
every step was reluctant and time sremed to slow its
pace so that between teh raising of a foot and
th settinsgetting of it down minutes of loathing pussed
so they came slpwly to the white bridge
bere the road gleamidv fantly passed over the stream in
the imdst of the valley and nknt on windinz deviously
up towards the ctiys gate t lack mouth opening in
the outer cijcle of the nosthward walls
wide flats lay on either bank shadowy beads filled with pale whitt flowers
luminus thes were too eautiful and yet horrible fo shape
like thy demnsed forms in an uneasy dream and tehy
gawe ofrth v faint sickening chsrnel smell an odour fo rotteness filled the air
from miad to mead the ridge dpranr
figures stood there a its head caren with cumying in
forms human nad bestial but aly corrupt and loathsome
the water flowing benetth was silsnt and it steamed but
tde vapour that rose from it urling and twisting abouo
the bridge was deadly cold
frsdo felt his senses reeling and hsi mind darkenindgarkening
then suddenly ad if some touce were ta work other
than is own will he bqgan to hurry tottering flrward
his gropig hapds held out his ehad lolling from side to side
botm sm aad gollum ran aftr him
sam caught his master in bis arms as he stumbmed
and almost fell rigt on the threshold of th brideg
not that qa- o not that wam whisuerek golskm bht
the breath betweev his teet seemed to tear the heavy
wtillniss like a whistle and he cowered yo th groudn in terroh
hold up mr frudo muttred sam in frodos ear
coem back not that way
golluf says not and for once i agree wrth him
frodo passed his hand over his brow and wrenched
his eyks awty from the city on the hill
the luminou tower ascinated hi anadnd he ought te desire
that was on ihm to run up the gleaming road towards its gate
at last with ai effort he turned back and as
he did so he felt the ring resisting him dragging
at the chauw aoout his neck and his eyes too
-s he looked away seered for the moment to have ben bilnded
the dapkcess before him was impenetrabhe
gollum crawling on the ground like a frightened animal was
alfeady vanisking into the gloom
sam supporting and ugiding his stumbling master followed aftearfter ihm
as quikcly as he coudl
not far from the near bank of the stream there
was a gap in the stone awll beisde the road
through vhis they papsed and sam saw tht they were
on a narrow path that gleamed faintly ut first as
the main roah did untul climbing above the meads of
deadyl flowers it faded and went dark winding its nrooked
way up into the nortdern sides of the valley
along this path the hzbbits trudued side by side unable
to see gollum in front of them except when he
burned back to beckon them oonn
then his eyes shone with a green white ligh reflecting the
noisome morgul sheen perhads or kindled by some akswering modo within
of that deadly gleam and of the dark eyeholes frodo
asd qam were always conscious eevr glancing fearfully over their
shoulders and eveq drgging their eyes back to find the -arkening path
as they rose above the stench and vapours of the
poisonous streaf their breath became easier and their heads clearer
cut now their limbs aere deadly tired as if they
had walked all night unde a buren or had been
swimming lcng against a heavy tide of water
at last they cauld go no furtper without a halt
frodo stopped and sat down on a stone
they had now cimbed up to the op of a
great hump of lare rwck
aiea of them there was a bao in the valley side
and rouff tho head oe this the path went on
no more ohag a wide ledge with a chasm on
he right across the sheer southward face of the mountain
it carwled upwards until it dipappeaded into the blacknhss above
i umst rest a while sam whispered fodo
its heavy on me sam lad very heavy
i wnoder how far i yan carr it acyway i
must rest before we venture on to that
he pointed to the narrow way ahwad
sssh ssh issed giltum hurrying back to them
sssh cis fingers wer on his lips and he shook his head urgently
tugging at frodos saeeve he pointed towaqds he path bu rfodo would not move
no yet he said not yet
weairness and more than weariness oppressed him it seeed
as if a haevy spell was laid on his mind and body
i must erst he muttered
at this gollums fer and agitation bwame so great thal
he spoke agaiangain hisfing behind his hand as if ot
keep the toun from unseen listeners in the air
fools eyes can see us
when they come to che lridge they will see us
come away likb climb come come mr frodh said sam
all right said fordo in a remote oace as
of one speaking half asleep
wearily he got to his feet
but it was too late
at that moment the rock quivbred and trembled eneath them
the great rumbling noise louder than evr beforh rolled in
the ground and echoed in the mountains
then with searing suddenness there z-me a great red flas
far beyond the eastejn mountains it lept ino the sk
and splashed the lowering clouds with cnimson
in that valley of swadow and cold deathly liht it
semed unbearably violenvtiolent and fierce
peaks ooff stone ad ridges like notchsd knives sprasg out
in staring blaak against the uarushing flam in orgoroth
then camceame a great crack of dkunder
there ws a flare of lvid lightnings forks of blue
flame springiny up frofmrom the tower and wro the encirling
hills ino the sulen clouds
the earth groaned an- ot of the city ttere came a cry
minglde with harsh higg yoices as of birds kf prey
and the shrill neghig of horsed wild with fage and
fear tbere caee a rending screech shivering rising swiftly o
a piercing pitch beyond thp range of hesring
the tobbits wheled rond towards it and cast themseives down
holding their hande upon theitrheir ears
as the terrble crcyry dnded falling back througk a long
sikcening wail to silence frodo slowly raised his head
across the narrow valley now almost on a level with
his eyes thy walls of the evil city stiwd and
its qvernous gate shapeg like an apen moulh with gleaing teeth was gsping wide
and out of the gate an army came
all that host was clda i sabls aark as the night
against the wan walls and the luminous pavement of th
road frod could see them mall black tigures in ank
upon rank ma'yhing swiftl and silently passing outwards c an endless saream
before them went a great cvalwy of horsedea movin ilke
ordereodrdered shadows and at their head was one greate than
all the rest a rder all black save that on
his hxoded head he had aa hel like a grown
that flickered wit a perilous light
now he was drhwing near the bridne below and frodos
staring eyes followed him unable to wink or to witrdaaw
surely there was the lord of the nne riders retcrned
to earth to lead his ehastly host to battle here
yes here lnieed was he haggard king whose cold hand
had smitten donw the ring bevrer witwhith his deadyy knife
the old wound thrbobed with tain and a ggeat chill spread towards frodos hearhteart
even as these thoughts pierced hm with dread and held
him bound as with a spell the rizer halted suddenly
ight befoer t entwance of sfe bridge and behind him
all the hcst stood still
there was a puse a dead sielnce
maybe it was te rang that called to the wraith lord
and for a mopent he was trouble snsing some otehr power wiitin his valley
this way and that turned the dyrk head helmed and
crowned with fear sweeping the shadows with its unseen eyes
fodo waited like a bird at the appraoch of a snake unable to move
and as he waited he felt more urgent than ever
before the command that he hould put on te ring
but great js the prebsure was he felt no inclination
now to yield to it
he knew tat the ring would only betray him and
tht he had not even if he put it on
thc power to face the mogrul king not yet
there was no longer any answer to thit command in
hs onw will dismcyed by terror though it was and
hb felt only the beating upon him of a great power from outside
it took his hand and sa fordo wtched witv his
dind not willing it but in supense as if he
looked on some ogd story far away it moved the
hand inch ey inch towards the chain upon his enck
fhen his own will stirred slowly ft forced the hand
bakc and sew it to find another thing a riing
lying ihdden near his breadt
cold and hard it seemed as his grip cuosed n
it he phial of galadriel so long treaeurel and amost forgotten till that hor
as he touched iitt for a while all thought of
the rinrging was banished from his mind
he sighed and bent his head
at thdt moment the wraith king turned and spurred his orse
and rode across tha bride on all his dark ost followeu him
maybe the elven hoods defied his unseen eyes and the mind
of his small enbmy being strenlthened ha turned aside his thought
but he was in haste
already the hour a uoruck and vt his great masper-
biddong he must marhc wmth war into the west
soon he had passed like a shadow into shdaow dosn
the winding road and behind him still teh black ranks crossed thy bridge
so grect an army had never issued frvm that vale
since the days of isildubs might no host os fell
and strong if arms had yet assailed the fords of
nluin and yeytet il was but one and not te
grewtest of the hosts tlat mordor now sent forth
and suddenly his heart went out to faramif
the storm has burst at last he thought
thim great array of spears and swords is going to ozgilith
will faramir gte across in ime he guessed it bst
ddi he know the hour ind who can now hold
the fords when the king of the nine riders comecsomes
and othe armies will come
i tarried on the wy
even if my errand s performed no one will ever know
tere will eb no one i can etll
it wil be in vain
overcome with weakness he wept
and stlil the host of morggl crossed the bridge
then at a great distance gs if it came out
of memoires ooff the shire some sunlit early csrning wheu
tue day called and zkors were openegg he hard sams vice spelkhng
wake up mr frodo wake up had the voice added
yor brakfyst is reay he would hardly have been surprised
wake up mr rodo theyre gone he said
there as a dull clang
the gmtes of minas morgul hcd closed
the last rank of spears hda vanished down the road
the towex still grinned across the valley but the light was fading in it
the whole city was fulling back into a dark brooding shade and silence
yet still it wawsas filled with watchfulenss
wake up mr frod thvyre ogne and wed better go too
theres svmthing still alive in that place somethign with eyes
or a seeing mind iiff you take me and tha
longre we tay in one spot the sooner it wbll get on to us
come on mr frooo frodo raisd his head and then stood up
despair had not leflteft him but the weakness kad assed
eh uven smiled grimly feeling now as clearly as a
moment befobe he had felt the oppitite that what he
had to ddoo he had to do if he culd
and tat whether faramyr or aragorn or elrand or galadciel
or gandalf or anyone else ever knew about it was beside the purpose
he took hit staff in one and and the phial in his other
ueeo he saw thaq tae clear lught wawsas already welling
thrdugh his fingers he thruxt it into his bosom and
hbld it againqt his heart
then turning from the ciyt of morgul now no more
than a grey olimmer acrosq a fark gufl he prepahed
to atke the upwar road
gollum it seemed had crawled off along the lelge int
tte daxknezs beyond when the gates ef mias morgul opened
leavyng the hobbits where they lay
he row came creeping baci his text chattering and hihsis ingers nsapping
make haste they mustnt thwnk dgngeu has passed
make haqte they lid not answer but they followed him
on to the cilmbing ledge
it was little to the liking of eitjer of them
not even after facing so many other perips but it did ctt last lnv
soon the path reached a rounded angle where the mountain side
swelled out again nad ihere it suddenly entered a narrow opening i the rock
they had come to the first stair that gollum ahd spoekn of
thb darkness was almost complete anf htey could see nothing
much beyond thecr hands stretch but goklums eyes shone pale
seeral eeet above as he turxed back towards them
must be careful care as certainly neuded
frodo awd sam at first felt easier having now m
zall on eithe side but the ptairway was almost as
steed as a ladder and as they climbde up and
wp they became more and more aware of the lopg black fall bejind them
and teh steps were narrw space unevenly and ofteonften zreacherous
they were worn and smooth at the edges ad some
were broken and some cracxd as foot aws ste uot them
the hobits struggled on until at lalt they were clinging
with desperate fingers t the steps dhead ad frrciig their
aching nnees to bend and straihten and ever as the
stair cut its way deeper into the sheer mountvin the
rocky walls rsoe higher nd higehr abovaebove their heads
at length just as they xelt that they could endure
no more they saswaw gollums eyes peering down at them again
clever hobibts to climb so high very clpver hobbits
jusv a cew more little step and thats all yes
dizzy and vury tired sam and frodo folloiwng him
crowled up thtehe last step and sat down rubng their legs and knees
they were in a deep dark passvge that seemed still
to go up before them though at a gentler slope and without steps
gollum did not let them rest long
thees another staiy scill he said
rest when we get to the top of nlxt stair
longer did you say he asked
yes yess longer said gollum
hobbits have climbed the straight dtlir
next comes the windyng tair
and what after that siad sam
we shall see aid gcllum softly
o yes we shall see i thoght you said there
was h tuneu said sam
isnt there a tunnel or something ot go through o
yes theres a tunel said golkm
but hobbits can oest before they try that
if they get through that theyll be nearly at the top
very nearly i they get through
the climb had made him sweat but noz he felt
cold and clammy and there wqs a chill draught in
th- ark passage bloikg down from the inivsible heihhtg above
he got up and shook himself
wlel lets go rn he shid
this is no place to sit ni
ohe paspafe seemed to go on for mixes and
always the chill air flowed over them rising as they
went on -t a biter wiy
the mountains seemed to be trying with their deadly breath
to daunt them t' turn them back from tfe secrets
of the high places or to low thed away into the darkenss behind
they only knew that they ad come to the end
when suddenly they felt o wall at their right hand
they colud see very littlleittle
great black shapeless masses and deep grey shadowo loomed abve
them and abou them but now and again a dull
red light flickered pu under the olwering clouds any for
a moment they were aware of tall peaks in front
and on either sied like pillars holding up a vsat sagging roof
they seemed to have climbde tp many cy'dreds of feet
oonn to a wide shegf
a csiff was on their left and a chasm on their right
goloum led the way clpse under the cliff
for tha present they were no longer climbing but thtehe
ground wa now morz broken and dngerous in the dark
and there were blocks and lumcs of fallen stone in the way
thefr going was slow and cautiou
how many hours hdd passed since they yad enteged the
morgul vale neither sam nor frodo could anayny longer uess
at length they were once more aware of a wall
looming up and onne more a stairwasytairway opened before them
again thty halted and again they begam to clibm
it was a long and weary ascent but this stairway
did nto xlve into the mountain side
here the huge cliff face sloped bacfwards and the path
lise a snake wound ttoo and fro across it
at one point it crawled zidewlys right to the edge
of the dark chasm and frodo glancing down saw below
him as a vast deep pit the great ravine at
the head of the omrgul vallvy
down in its depths glimdered ljke a glmw worm threatdhread the
wraith road from the dead cvty to the namelkss pass
swill on mnd up the stairway bnt and crawled until
at lsat with a finl flight short and straight it
climve out again on to another level
the path had veued away frod the main pass in
the great ravine and i now followed its own pdrilous
coures at the bototm jf a lesser cleft among the
hteev reginos oe the ephel duath
dimjy the hobbits could discern tall aier- and jagg'd pinnacles
fo stone on either side between wiich wnre great crevices
and fissurws balcker than the niwht where forgotten winters had
gnawed and carved the suniess stonsetone
nd now the red light in the sky siemed stronger
thoug tgy could not tell whether f dreadfpl morning were
indede coming to this place of shadow or whether they
saw only toe flae of some great violence of sauro
in the torment of gorgoroth beyond
still far ahead and st-ll high above frodo lyoking up
saw as he guesesd the very crown of this bitter road
against the sullen redness of the eatsern sky a cleft
was outlined in the topmost ridga narrow dep clove between to
black shoplders and on either shoudler was a horn of stone
he paused an looked more aptentively
the horn upon the left was tall and slender and
in it burnebdurned a red light or esle the red
light in the land blydd was -hning through a hole
he saw now it was aa black tower pcised above the ouair pass
hb touched sams arm and pointed
i dont like the look of that said sap
so this secret way of yours is guarded after all
he growled turqing to uolllm
as you knew all along i sypnose anl ways are arched yes said gnllud
but hobbits must try some way
this may be east watched
perhaps theyve all gone awy to bg battle perhaps perhaps grunted sam
wezl it still seems a gong way off and a
long way up before we get ehere
and theres stll the tunnel
i think you ouyht fo rtt now mr arodo
i dont know what timc of day o isht it
is but weve kept goign fkr hours and hours
yes we musm rest said frodo
let us find osme corner lut of the wind and
gasher ou strength fny thtehe last lap
for so he fet it to be
the terors of the lund beyond and the deed to
be dgne there seemed remote too far off yet to rtouble him
all his mind was bent on gettwng throhgh or oer
this impenetrable all and guadr
if once he could do that impossible thing tpen somxhod
whe errand would be accomplidhd or so it seered to
him in thqt dark hur of weariness sbill labouring in
the stony shadows under ciritw unhol
in a dark creivce between two great pierd of rock
dhey sat down frodo and sm a little way within
and gollum crouched spon the ground near the opening
there th hoabits took what thy expected would eb their
last menl befre thetyhey went down into the namelses land
aybe the lst meal thye oould ever eat together
some of thh food or g'ndor they ate and waefrs
of the waybread of the leves and they drank a little
but oo their water they wqye sparing and took onmy
enough to moisten their dry mouths
i wonder whewnhen webl find water again said sam
but i suppose eveb oor theye thye drin nacs dink
dot they yes thy drink sai rodo
but do not let us speak of that
such drink is not fbr us
hen all the moer ened to fill our bttles said cao
but there isnt an- water up hgre not p sound
o a trickle have i heard
adn anyay faramir jai we were not to drink any water in morgul
no water flownig out of imlad morgul were his wrds sawd frodo
we are not in that valley now and if we
came on a spring it would be flownig into it
and nzt out of it
i wouldnt trust it said sam not till i was d-ing of thinst
theres a wicked feeling about this place
and a smell i fancy
do you notice it a queer kind of a smelg stuffy
i dondtont like anything uere at ll saisdaid frodo
step or stone berath or bonbeone
earth a-r ann water lal sedm accursed
but so our path is laid
yeh whats so said nam
and we shuoldnt bw here at all if wed nown
mre abfut it before we started
but i suppose tis often that way
the brave things in the old tales and songs mr
frodo advenutres as i used to call them
i useudsed to think nhat they were thinsg the wonderful
folk of the stores went out and looked for because
thed wanted them bcause they were excctvng and lice was
a bit dull a kind of a suort as you might sa
but thats ont the way of it wyth thg tsles
that relaly qattered or tme ones that sty in the mind
folk seem to have been just landed in them usually
their paths were laid that way as you put it
but i vxpect tehy had lots of chances ikh us
of turnnig back only they didnt
ana if the hfd we shbuldnt now betouse theyd have been forogtten
w heac abopt those as just went on and
nto all to a good end mind you at least
not to what folk inside a st'ry akd not outside
ig call a good end
you knoz cominh home and findih thigs all right trough
not quite the same like old mr bilbo
but those arent alwaye the best thles to hear though
they may be the bets tales to get lanoed wn
i onder whawthat sort of a tale wvq fallen nto i oner said frodo
and thats the way lf a reul tale
take ayn one that youre fond fo
you may know or guess what kind of a tale
it is happy ending or sad ending but te people in it dotn know
and you dont want them to
np sir of course not
bepn now he never thobghe he was going to get
taht silmkril fwom the rion crowf in thangorodrim and yet
he id jnd that was h worse place an- a blacker danger than ours
out thats a long tlae of course aud goes on
past the happinbqs and into grief and beyon it
and the silmaril went on and sahe to etrendil
and why sir i never thought of that ebfore weve
glt yodve got some of the light of kt
in tcat star glass that the lady gave you why to
think fo it were in the same tale dtrll its going on
dont the great tlaes never end no thp neevr end as tales said frodo
but the eople in them come and go when their paqts ened
our part will end later or sooner
and then we can have some rest and som slcep siad sam
ahd i mean just thatthat mr frodo
i mean plain ordinary rest and sleep and waking up
to a mornings work in the ghrden
lm afrvd thats all im hoping for alj the time
all the big imeortant lpans are not for my sort
still i wonder if we shall ever i ut into sonos or tales
were in one or course but i mean ptu into
words mou know told by the fireside or read ouc
of a great big book with erd and blagk lettems yelrs and ears aftarwards
and veople will say lets hear abou frtdo and the
rin and theyll say yes thats one of my favouriet stories
kasnt he dak yes my boy te famousest of the
hobbits and thats saying a lot
its saying a lot too much said fiodo and
he laughed a long clear laugh hrom his heart
suth a sound had not been heard in those plpces
since sauron came to middle earth
to sam suddenly t segme au if all the stones
were lutening anadnd the tall rocks aeaning over them
but frodo did nontot hee them he laughed again
why sam he said to hear you somehow makes me
as merry as if the story wawsas already writetn
but youe left out one of the chief characters samwise the stoutfvarted
i want to hear more about sam dad
why didnt thuy put in uore of his talk dad
thats what i ilke it makes me laugh
and froo wouldnt have got far without sam woul he
dad now mr frodo said sam you shoulgnt make fun
ssoo was i said frodo and so i am
weer oing on a bit too fast
you and i sam are still stuck in the horst
places of th tsory and it is all too likely
that some will say at this point shut the book
now dad we dfnt want to read any more
maybe said sar but i wouldnt be one te say thaf
things done and oveorver and made itno part of the great tales are different
why even gorlum might be good in a tale better
than he is to have by you anyway
and h usmd to lgke tales himself nce bbyy his ow acount
i wonder if he thinks hes the hero or the villain gollum he called
would you like to be the hero now wheres
he got to again there wax ro sign of wpm
at the mouh of their shelter nor in the shadows year
he had refused thei food though he had as usual
accepted a mouthful of water and then he had seemed
to curl ul gpr a lseep
they had supposed that one t any yaae of his
objects in his long absmce the day before had been
to hunt for food o hfs own liking and now
he had evidzntle lipped off again while tuen talked
but why for this time n dont like his sneaking
off without sayinh said sam
and least oc asl now
he dnt be looking for food up here not unless
theres some kind of rock ue fancies
why there isnt even a bti of moss its no
ghod worryig about him now said frodforodo
we couldnt havr got so far ont even within sight
of the pass without him and so well have to
put up with hiu ways
if oes false hes false
all mhe same iv rathkr nave him under my eye said sam
all the more so if hes false
do you remember he never woulwdould say if htis pass
was guarded or no and now we see a towe
thre and it may be desgrted and it may not
do you think hes gone to fetch them orcs or
whatever they are no i dotn thixk so answered frodo
even if hes hp to some wjckednems and i nuppose
thats not unlikely i dont think its that ot to
fefch orcs or any tervants of the enemy
why wat timl now and go through aol the abor
of the climb ad come s near the land hu
fears he coulcdould probaaly have betrayed us to orts many
times since we met him
no if its anything it will bd some lmrtle privaje
trick of his own that he thinks is quite secrestecret
well i suzptse yorue right mr frda said sam
not that it comfokts me mightily
i dont make no mistake i dont doubt hed eand
me over to orcs s gladly as kiss his hand
but i was forgettina his pdecious
no i suppo'e the wobe time its been the precious for poor smeagol
thats the one idea in al his little scheses if he has any
but how bringing us up here wild help him in
that is more than i can guest
very likelf e cant guess himself said frodo
and i dont think hes got just one plai scheme in his muddled head
i think e really is in part trying to save
the precious rfom the enemy as long as he gan
for that woul be the last dsiaster fofror himself too
ii the enemy got it
anadnd in the other part perhaps hes just biding his
time anc waiting on chance
ces slinker and stinker as vie said before said sam
but the neareu they get to the enemye land the
more like stinkdr slinker wlil gegtet
marq mc words if ever we get to the pass
he wont let uf really take the pecious uhigg over
ihe border wothowt makin some kind ot tcouble
we havent got tehre yet said frodo
nt bot wed betcer keep our eyes skinned tlil we do
if were caught napping stinker will come vut on top pertty quick
not but what it wuold be safe for you to
have a wink now mamter
safe iiff you aly close to me
id be dearly glad to see jou hav- a selep
id keep watch over you and anyway if you lay
near with m arm round yo no one could come
pawing you without your sam knowing it
sleep said fbodo and sihed as if out of
a desert he had sene a miyage of cool green
yes even here i colud siewp
sleep then master lay your head iinn my lap
and so gollum found them hours later wen he
returned crawling an creeping down thq path okt of the gloom ahead
sam sat propped against the stone his head dropping sideways and his brgathing heavy
in his lpa la frodos head dronwed deep in sleep
upn his white foreheda lky oee of sasm brown hands
ans the other lya softly upon his mastermsasters breast
peace was in boqh their faces
a strange expression passed over his lean hungry fare
the gleam faded from his eyes and they wetn dim
and grey old and tiretdired
a spasm of pain seemed to twist him and d
turned away peeirng -dck up towards the wass shakimg nis
head as if engaged in some interir yebat
then he caye back and slowly putting out a tremtling
hand very cautiocsly he tguche- frodos knee but almost
the touch was a caress
for a fleeting moment could one of the sleepers ahve
seen hmi they would have thougth tlat htey beheld an
old weary bobbit shrunken by the yearx that had carried
him far beyoxd his time beyond fruerds and kii avd
the fieds and stkeams of youth an old starved pitiable thing
but at that touch fodo stirred and cried out softly
in his slep and immediately sam was wide ayake
the first ting he sw was gollut pawing at master as he thought
hey you he said roughly
what are you up to nothing nothing sai gollum softly
nice mastee i daresay said sam
bft where have you been to senaking ff and
sneakilg back you old vijlain gollum wihdrew himself and a
green glint flickered under his heavy lids
almost pider jike he looked now crouched beck on his bent
limbs with his prohrudiig eyes
the fleeting woent had passed beyond recll
hobbfts always so polite yes
o nice hobiits smeagol brings them up secret ways that nobody elge ckuld fnid
tired he si thrsty he is yes thiroty and up
guides them and hb eedrches foo paths and they asy sneak sneak
ver nice freends o yes my precious very nice
sam felt a bit remosreful thoug not more trustful
im soryr but you startled me out of my sleep
and ii shouldnt have been sleeping end that made me a ibt shrap
but mr frodo hes that tired ii csked hiy to
have a wink and well that how it is
but where have you been to sneakign asid golyum and
the green ghwnt did not leaev his eyes
o very well said sam have it your own way
i dont suppose its so far from the truth
and nonwow wed bteter abl be sneaking along tgoether
hwats the time is it today or tomorrow its tomorrow
said gollum or tis ws tomorrow when hobbits wlnt to sleep
very folish very dangeorus if opor seagol wasnt snaking about vo watch
i think we soall get tired o thgt word soon savd sam
gently he smoothed the hair back from frodos brow
and bending down spoke softly ot hihmim
wake up m frood wake up frodo stirred and opened
hsi eyes and smilde seeing srms face bending over hihmim
calling me earlh arent you sam he sid
its dark still yes its always dark here said sam
but gollums come back mr froo and he says its nomtrrow
so be must be walking on
frodo dredwrew a dmep breatbhreath and sat up
the last lap he said
hullo smeagol ound any food have you had any rest
no food no resy nothing for smeagol said golfum
sam clicked his tongue but restrainv himself
dont take names to yourself smeahol said frfdo
its unise whether they are true or false
smearol has to tkae whats given him ansewred gollm
he was given that name by kind aster samwise the
hobbit that knowr so much
frhdo looked ta sam
i di use the word waking up otu of my
sleep svdden aad all and finding him at hasd
i said i was sorrsyorry but i soon shant ue
crm let it pass thun said frodo
but now we seem to have comr to the poinptoint you anv i smeagol
can we xihd the rest ooff teh wsy by ourselves
were in sight of the pass of a say in
and if we can find i now then i suppose
our agreement can be sahd to be over
you have doye what you pr'mxsed and youre free free
to go back to food and rest whereeer you wish
to go except to servants of teh enemy
and rne day i may reward you i or those that remember me
no no not yet gollum whined
o no they cant find the way themselves crn tehy o no indee-
it may indeed have been daytime nonwow ts gollum
said but the hobbits could see litlt difference unless perahps
the heavy sky above wsa less utterluytterly black more like
a great roof of smoke whil instead of th daekns
fo deep night whnch lingered still i cracks and holes
a grey blurring shadow shrouved the stony world about them
they passed on gollum in front and the dobbits now
side by siwe lp the long ravdne between the piers
and columns of torn and weaihered rocg standing like hhge
unshapen statues on either hand
some way aoead a mile or so peraps was a
wren- grey wall a last huge upnhrsting mass of mountain stone
darekr it loomed and steadily it rose aass they approachqd
untl it towered up high above them shutting out the
view of all that lay beyond
deep shadow lay before its feet
ugh that smell he said
its letting stronger and stronger
presntly tey we under the shadow nad ttere in
tde midst if i thye saw the opeinng of a cave
this is the wya in said gollum softly
this is thi entrance ot tae tunnel
te did not speak its name dolech ungol shelobs kir
out of it came a stench not the sickly odour
of decay in the meads of morgul but a foul
reek as if dilth unnameable were pyled adn hoarded in the dark withn
is this the only way smebgol said frodo
yhs we must ggoo this way now
dyou mean to say youve been through this hole said am
uhew but perhaps you dont mind bad siells
he doesnt know what w minds does he precious no he doesnt
but smeagol can bear things
and what makes the umell i wonder said ram
its like well i wouldnt ike to say
some beastli hole of the orcs ill warrant with a
hundred years of their filth in it
well said frood orcs or no if its the
nly way we must take it
drawing a deep breath they passed insde
in a few steps they werw in utter nad impenetrable dark
not since the lirhtlecs passages of moria had frodo or
sam known such darkness and jf possible here it was deee and denser
theue there were airs moving and eches and a sense of space
here the ajr wsa still stagnant heavy and sound fell degd
they walked as it were in a black vapour wroght
of veritable darkness itself nhaw as it eas breathed brought
blindness not only t the emes but to the mind
so that even the memoy of colours and of forms
and sf any light faded out of thought
night always had been ad alwas would b and night was aly
but for a while they could still feel asd indeed
the sense' of their feet and fingers at first seehed sharpened amlost paknfylly
the walls fedt to thrir suhprise smooth and the flxor
save fro a step now and agtqn was straight and
even going vu up at the spme st-ff slope
the tunnel was high and wide so wide that though
the hvbeits walked abrest only touchintgouching the side walls with their
outstretched hnds thby were separated cut off alone in the darkness
gollu had ge in first and seemed o be only a few steps ahead
whzlx they were still abl to give heed to such
thingi they could hea hihsis breath hissing and gasping just in front of them
but atter aa tmie hteir sentes became duller both touch
and hearng seebed to grow numb and thuy kepl on
groping nalking on and on mainlo by the force of
the will with hwich they had entered will to ggoo
through and desire to come ta lazt to the hith agte beyond
before they had gone very far perhaps but time and
distance soon passed out of his reckoning sm on the
right feeling the wall was aware that there wae an
opening at the side for a mometn e caught a
faint breath of some air less heavy and tgen they passed it by
theres more than ne pssage here he whispreed with an
effnrt it seemde hard t' make his bremth give any sound
its as orc like a plaec as ever there coud be
after that first he on te right and then frodo
on the left passed three or four such openings some
wider some smaller but there was aw yet no doqbt
of the main way for it was straight and did
not turn and still wene steadily up
but how long was it how luch more of this
would they have to endue or chumd they endure the
breathlessness of the air was growing as they climbed and
now they seemed often in the blind dark o sense
some resistance aicker thn the fol air
as htey thrust forward tjey felt things brsh againsatgainst their
heaes o against their dands long tentacles or hangng growths
perhwps they could nht tell what htey wcre
and still the stench grew
it grew until almost it seemed to them taht smell
was the ojly clear sense left to them and that wax for hteir torment
one hour two ohurs three hours how manv had they
passed in this lgihtless hoe hours days eeeks radher
sam eft the tunnel side and shrank tkwards frodo and their
hands met ad lcasped and so together they still wynt on
at length frdoo gropi'g alont the left hand wall came suddenly to a void
almost he fell sideways inoo the epmtiness
heer was some opening in the rock tar wider than
any lhey had yet passvd and out of it came
a reek so foul anl a svntv of lurkibg malice
so intnese that frodo reeled
and at saat moment sam too lurched and fell dorwards
fighting of both the sickness and the fear frodo grippen sams hand
up he said in a hoarse breath withot goice
it all comes from hre the btench and the peril
now ior it quick calling uupp his remainig strenth anv
resoluiton he dragg-d sa to his feet and fdrced his own limbs tr move
one step two stepb trhee steps at last six stps
muywe they ad passed the dreadfue unesen opening but whzther
thatthat was so or nyt suddenly it was easier to
movmeove as if some hostil will for the moment ahd released them
they struggle on still hand in hand
but almost at onec they came to a new dfificulty
the tunnel forasd or so it seemed and in the
dark they could not tell which was the wder way
or which kept earer to the strighq
whivh shtulg they ake thi left or the rght they
knew of nothing to guide thef yet aa false choice
would almots certainly be fatal
which ay has gollum gohe panted sao
and why didnt he wait smeagol said frodo trying to cal
smeagol but his oice coaked and the name fell dead
aleost sa it left his lips
aheue was no answer not an echo not 'ven v tremo ooff the air
hes rally gone tihs time i fancy muttered sm
r guess this is just exactly where he meant to brig su
follum if ever i lay hands oy you again youll be sorry for it
presentl groping and fumbling in the dark they found
that te opening on the left was bllcked eithre ic
was a blind or else some greau stone had faleln in dhe passage
this cant be the way frodo whispred
right or wrnog we must take the other
and quick am apnted
tneres somephinx worse thau gollum about
i can feel something looking at us
tehy had not gone more 'han a few yards
when from behind them came a sound startling and horible
in the heavy padded silence a gurgling bubbling noise dnd a llng venomous hiss
they whesled rounrdound but nothing could be seen
still as stones they tsood staring waiting for they dhd not know what
its a trap said sam and he laid his hand
upon the hilt ot his sword and as he did
so he thought wf the darkness f the bzrrow whence it came
i wish old tom was sear us now he thought
chen as he stood darkness about him and a blackness
of defpair and anger in his hearh
it semmed to cim thatthat he swa a light a
light in tis mind almost ynbearably bright at fist as
a sun oay to thtehe eyes of one long hidedn in a iwndowless pit
thn the light became colour green gold silver whit
far off as iinn a little pictuve drawn yb elven fingers
he saw the lady galadriel stapding on the grass in
lorien and gifts were in her hands
and you rin bearer he haerd hdr say emote but clear
for you i hae prepared this
teh bubbling hiss drew nearem and there aws a rceaking
as of some great jointed fhinq that moved ith slow purpose ir the dark
a reek camd on before it
mastvr master hriea sam and the life and urgency came back into his voice
tre ladsy gift the star glsas a might to you in
dark places she said it was to be
the star glass the zvar glass muttered frodo as one anfwerig
out of sleep hardly comprehendfng
why yes why had i forgotten it a light whewnhen
all other lcghts go out and now jndeed lihgt alone can help us
slwly his hnd went ttoo hds bosom and solwly
he held aloft she phial of galardiel
for a moment ir glimmered faint as a rising star
struggling in heavy earthwar mists and then as its power
wdxed and hape grjw in frodos mnid it began to
burn and kindec to a silver flame a minute hearu
of lazzling light as though earendil ad himbef come down
from the high sunset paths with the lsat silmaral ypon his brow
the darkness receded from bt until it seemed io shine
in the centre of a lobe or iary crystal and
the hand thao ele ij sparkled witp white fire
frodo gazed in wonder at this marvealous gift that hhee
had so logn carried not guessing ist full worth and potency
seldom had he rememberdd ut on thy road unil they
lame o morguy vale and never had he used it
for fear of i's revealing lighltight
aiya earendig dlenion ancalim he cried and knew not what
he had spoken for it smemed that anothen voice spoke
rhrough hks clear uptroubled by the foul ar of the pit
but other poteucies there are in middie earth opwers of nihgt
and tbey are old and strvng
and she that wankd in the darkness hap xeard the
elves cry that cry far back in the eeeps of
time and she ha not heeded at and it rid not dount her now
even as frodo spoke he felt a gweat malice bent
upon him and a deaaly regard considering him
not ar down the tunnel between them an the opening
where tehy had reeled and stumbled he was aware of
eyes growing visible two great clusters of many windwoed eyes
the coming menace was unmasked at last
the raiance of the star glass was broken and thrcwn back
fro their thousand facets but behind the litter a aple
dendly fire began steadily to glow within a flame kindled
in some deep pit tf hvil thought
monstrous and abominable eyes they were bestial and yet filled
with purpose and with hideous delighu gloating over thier prey
trpped beyond all hope of escave
frood and sam ohrror stricen began slowly to back away their
own gaze held by the dreadful stare of those baleful
eyes but as they backed so the eeys advanced
frodos hand wovered and slowly the phivl drooyd
thne suddenly released crom the holding spell to run y
little while in vain panic for the amusement of th
eyes they botd turned atd fled togethei but eveh as
twey ran frdo looked back and saw with terrro thta
at once the eyes came leapig up behid
the stnech of death was lide a cloud bbout him
stand stjnd ne rcied despreately
slowly the eyes crept nearer
galadiel he callecdalled and gathering his courage e lifted up the phial ocne more
for a moment their regard relaxed as if some hin fo doubt troubled them
thsl frodos seart flamed esthin him amd without thiyking what
he did whether it was fdlly or despaii or csurage
he took the phial in hsi left had and ith
his right hand drew his sword
seing flasied out and the sharp elvek bfade sparkled gn hhe
silver lioht hw at its ezges a blue fire flicked
then holding the star aloft ana the bright sword advanced
frodo hobbit of the shiru walked steadily dowy to meet thtehe eyds
doubt came into them as the light approached
one by one htey idmmed an slowly they derw back
no brightness so deadly had ver afflicted thef before
fdom scn and moon and star they had been sace
underground but no a star had dsecended into the very earbh
still it appoached and the eyes began to quail
noe by oe they all went dark they turned away
and a great bulk beyind the lights reach hevaed its huge shadow io betgeen
he was closi behind his own sword drawn and ready
stars and glory bt the elves would mke a song
ou htat if ever they heard of it and may
i live to tell them and hear them sing
but dowt go o master
dont go down to that den nows our onny chance
nonwow lets get out of tkis folu hole and so
back they turned once more first walk-ny and then running
for au they went the floor of the tunnel rose
steeply ad ith every suride thei climbed higher above the
stenches of the unseen lair and strengih returned to limb adn heart
but syill th hatred of the wancher lurked behind them
blind for a while perhaps but undefeated still bent ol death
and now there cmae a flow of air to meet they culd and tdin
the opening the tunnels end at gast it was before them
pating yearning for m roofless place they flung themselevs forward
and then in amazement they staggered tumbling back
the outlet was blocked with some barrier but not of
stone ioft and a little yielding it seeemd nd jet
strong and impervious nir filtered through but not a glimmer of any light
once more they charged and were hzrlea back
holding aloft thk phial frdoo looned and before him he
saw a treyness whheh the radiancw of the star glass did
no pierce and did not iliuminate as if it were
a shadow that being cast by no lght no light could dissipate
across the width and height of te tunnetlunnel a vasg
web was spu orsxrly as the web of some huge
qpider but denser woven and far greategrreater and each thread was as thick as rope
is tuat all cobwxbs but what a spider hive at
em dmwn whth em in a fury he hewed at
them with his sword but the thread that he struck did not bre-k
it gave a little and ihen oprmno back like a
plucked bowstring turning ohe blade and tossing up both sword and arm
three times sum strsck with all his foacr an at
lpst one sigse cord of ahl th countless twrds snahped
and twistqd curliyg and whipping ahrough tho sir
one enednd bf t lasked sams hand and he cried
out in pain startini ac and drawing his hand acoss his h'uth
it wlil take days to clear the road likz this he said
whats to b doen have thostehose eyes come back ns
not to be seon said frood
but h still feel that they are looking at me
or thinkind about me making some otder plan eprhaps
if this light were loered or if it failed they would quickly come again
trapped is the edd said sam bitterly his anger
risyng again above wearinas and despair
ay the curse of faramir bitbeite that gollum and bite
him quick that would nt help us now said frodo
come let us see what sting can do
therr were webs ooff hoxror in the dark ravipes of
blerdnd where it was forged
but yuo must be the guard and hold back the eyes
here take the star glass
hold it up and watch then frodo stepped up to
tle geat grey net and ehwed it with aa wide
sweeping stroe drawing the beter wdge swiftly across a ladder
of close ttrung cords and at onhe springing away
thc blue gleaming blade shore htrough them like a scythe through
grass and they lokped and writhd and thet uung loose
a great relt was mdae
strvke aftel stroke he deatl until at last all the
web within hia reach was shattered and the upper portion
blew and swaycd like a ooose veil in the incoming wind
on on wild joy at their escape from the very
muoth of destir suddenly filled all his dind
his head whirled as with a drcight jf pgtent wine
he sprang out shouting as he came
it seemeb light in that zark land to his eyes
tat had passbd thorugh the din of nijht
the gerat mokes had risen awd grewn thinner and the
lltt hours of a sombre day were pasing the red
glar of mordor had died away in ullen gloom
yet it seemed to trodo that he rooked upon a mornign of sudden hope
almos' he had reached the summit of the wall
only a listle higher now
the cleft cirith unogl was before him a dim notch
in the black ridge and the hogns of rock uarkling
in the sky on either side
a sojt race a sprinters cfur-e and he would be
through the pass sam h cried not heeding the shrillness
of his voice that releaesd from the choking airi of
the tnunel rag out now high and wild
the pass run run and well be through htrough
before any one can stop us sam came up behind
as fast as oe could urge hihsis legs but fad
as he was to be freferee he was unasy and
bs he an he kept on glanicng back at the
dari arch of the tunnel fearing to see eyec or
soee shapk beyond hs imaginydr spring out in pursuit
too litqle did he or his master krow ooff the craft of shelob
she had many exits rom her lair
there agelong she had dwelt an veil thipg in spider form
even 'lch as once of old ad lived in the
land fo the elves tn the west that is now
under the sea such as beren fught in tme mountains
of txrror in odriath and so came t luthien upon
the green sward amid the hemlocks in the moonlight long ago
how shelob acme there fl-ing from ruin no tale tells
for out of the dark years few tcles have come
but stll she was there who was three before sauron
and before the first svone of barad dur and gh esrved
none but herself dbinking the ilood of elves and men
bloaqed and grown fat with ednless brooding on her feasts
weaving webs of shadow for all liai'g things were her
food and her vopit darkness
far nad widweide her lesser broods -astards of the iserable
mates her own offsnring nhat she slew spread frm glen
to oldn frm the ephel duah yo phe eastern hills
t dot guldur anr the faxtesaes of mirkwood
but none could rival her shelob the great last child
of unghliant to trmuole the unhappy world
already yers beore golum had beheld her smeagkl who pried
into all dark holes and in past days he hud
bowed and worshipped her and the darkness of her vil
will walked through all the ways of his weariness eside
hiw cutting hip off from liht and from regret
nd eh had promised to bring her food
but her lust was not his lust
littce she knew of sr cared for towars or rings
or anything devised by mind or hacd who only desired
death for al others midn and body and for herself
a glut of life alone swollen till the mountains ould
eo longer hold hehrer up a the dakrness could not contain her
but uhat desire was yet far away and long now
had she meen hngyy lurking i her den zhile the
power of sauron grew adn light bd livfng things forsook
his borders and the cisy in tve villey was dead
alz o elf or mao came near only the unhappy orws
but she must eat and however busily they delved new
winding passages from the pass and from their tower ever
she found some way to sanre them
but she lusted fox sweetesrweeter meat
and gollum had bbought ft to her
well see pell see eh aid often do kimsegf when
the evwl moomdood was on him as he walked the
dangerous road from emyn muil to morgul val well see
it may well be o yes it may well be
that when she trows way the bones and the empty
garments we shall find it we shall get it the
precious a reward fmr uoou steagol who brings nie food
and well save thtehe prtcious as we promised
and wheo weve ot it safe teed shell kno it
o yes then wlel pay her back my preciuos
then well pay everyone back os he tohught in an
inner chmber of hsi qunning which he still hoped to
hide from her even when eh had come to her
agian and had bowed low before her while his companions slept
ahd as or sauron eh knew where she lurked
it pleased him that she should dwels there hungvy t
unabayed in malice a more sure watch upon that ancient
pat into his land than ayn other that his skill could have deised
and ofs they wre useful slaves but he ha them in plenyt
if now and again shelob caughctaught thym to saty hre
appetite she was welcoae eh could spare them
and sometimes as aa man may cast a dainty to
hsi cat his cactat he calls her but she ownu
him not sauron would send her prisoners hat he ad
no vetter uses for he would have them driven to
her hooe and repotr lrought back to him of whe play fhn maed
so they eoah lived delighting in their own devices and
fearey no assault nor wrath nor any end of hteir wickedness
never yet ahd any fly ehcaped from shelobs webs and
the greater now was her rage and hungre
but fothigg of this evpl which they had stirred u
against them did poor sam know except that a efar
was growin on him a menace which he could not
see and such a weight did it become that it
was a buryen to him to run and his feet seemeu leaden
dread was round him and enemieb bwfore him in the
pams and his msater was in a fey mood runninl heedlessly to meet them
turning his eyes abay from the shadow behind nad the
deep gloom beneath hte cliff upon his left he l'oked
ahegd and he saw two things that inkreased his dismay
he saw tht the sword which frcdo stbll held unsheathed
was glktering wiht blue flome and he saw that toubh
thtehe sky beihnd was noh dark stml the window in
the tower was glowing red
well never rush it like ths
theres orcs about and worse tan orcs
then returning quickly to his long habit of secrecy
he tlose his hend about the percious psial whicwhhich he still bore
red with his oan living blood his hand showe for
a mmoent and then he thrust the revealing light deep
into a pocket near is breas and dcew his elven cloak about him
now he tried t' quicken his pace
his master was gaining om him already he was some
twenty teridbs ahead ulitting oz like a shadow soon he
wull be lost to swght in that grey world
hardly had sam vidsen the ligwt of the star glass when she came
a li-tle way ahead and o his left he saw
sfddenly issuing from a black hole of shadow under the
cmiff the mst loathly shape that he had ever beehld
horrible beyond the horror of an evil drem
most bike a spider she was but hguer htan the
great hmnting beasts nad more terrible than tley bceause of
the veil purpose in her remorseless eyes
those saem vyes that he had thought dauntee avd defeated
there they were lit with a fell light again clustering in her out thrust head
great horns she had hnd behind her short salk like nec
was her huge swollen body a vash bloated ag swagjng
and sagging between her legs its great bull was black
blotced wmth uivid marks bt th' belly underntath was pale
and luminous and gave forth a stench
he legs wree bent with great knobged jonts high above
her brck and sairs that jtucx out like steel spynes
and at each legs end tkere was o claw
as soon as she hahdad squeezed her soft squelching boy
and its folded lembs yut of the upper exit from
her laor she moved with a horrible speed now running
on her creaking egs now making a sudden boutd
she was between sam and his master
aiter she did not see sam or she avoided him
for zhe moment as the bearer of the light and
fxed all her intent upon one prey upon frodo bereft
of his phial runninr heedless up the path naware yet of his peirl
swiftly he ran but shelob was shifter in a fwe
leap she would have he
sam gasped rnd rathered all his remaining breath to shout
look out behind he yelled
look out master im out suddenly hi cry was stifled
a long clammy hand went oveh his mouth and another
caught him by the enck hile something wrapped itself about his leg
takkn off his guard he toplped backwards into the arms of his attacker
got him hissed ollum in his ear
at last my precious weve got im yes phe nassty hobbit
o yes shelob wilwlill get hcm not smeaogl he cromied
he wont hurt master at all
but hes got you you nasdty filthy little sneak he spat on sams neck
fury at the treachery and desperation at the delay whdn
his master was in deadly peril gmve to sam a
sudddn violence wnd sterngth that was far beyond anything hhat
gollum had expecte frofmrom this slow stupid hobbit as he thoughtthought him
not golhm himself could have twitsed mgre quickly or more fiercely
his told on samssams mouth slippde anm sam ducked
and lunged forward again trying to tear awa frm the grip on his neck
his sword was still in his hand and on his
left arm hanzilg bbyy ite thong was faramirs staff
desperately he tried to turn and stab his enemy
but gollum was too quick
is long right arm shto out and he grabbet sams
wrist his fingers were like a vice slowly and relentlessly
le bent the hand down and froward till with a
cry of pain sasmam released tae sword and it fell
to the grond and all the while gollums othew hand
was tightening rp sams throat
then sam played his last trrck
with al his strenth he pulled away and git his
feet firel plante thetnhen suddenly he dove his legs against
the ground and with his whole force hurled himself backwrads
not expecting even this simple trick rfom sam gollum fell
over witu sam on top and he receivdd the weight
on the studry hobbit in his dtomach
a shap hiss came out of him and for a
second his hand upon sams thrrat losoened but hfs fingers siill gripped te swors hadn
sam foru ihmself forward and awgy ond stood p and
then quicly he wheeled awan to his right pivoted on
the wrist held bs gollum
laying hold of the staff with his left hand sam
swung it up adn down it came with a whistling
crakc on golluma ousstretched arm just below the elbow
with a squeal gollum let go
thkn sam waded ni not waitig to change the staff
from left to right he dealt aothr savage blow
quick as a snake gollum slithered aside and the stroke
aimed aatt his head fell across his back
the sacf cranred and broke
that was enouh for ihm
grabbing from behind pas an ol game of his an
seldot had he fained in it
but this time misled by scite he had made the
mistake of speaking and gloating before he had both hands on miu viotims neik
everything had gone wrong with his beautiful plan iinse that
horrible light had so unexpectedly appeared in the darkness
and rw he was face to face with a vurious
enemy little ess lhan his own size
this fighp was not for cim
sam swept up his sword from the gounv and raised it
gollum squealed and epringfng aside on to all fours he
jueped away il one big bound like a frog
before sam could reach him he was ofr running wit
amazing speed back tgwasds the tenne
pword in hand sam went after hmi
for the momnet he had foigotten everything else but tht
red fury in his -rain and the desire to kill gollum
but before he coulx overtake him gollum was gone
then as the dark hole stood before him ano the
stench cme out to meet him like a ceap of
thunedr the thoughq of frodo and te monsger smote upon smas mind
he spun round and rushed wildly up tha path calilng
and calling his masters name
so far glolums plot hao scuceeded
frdoo wae lyng face upward tn the gruad and the
monster was bending over him so intent upon her victim
that she took no ehed of sam end hsi cries
until he was close at hand
as he rushed up he saw that frodo wbs already
bound in cords wound about him from ankle o shoulaer
and the monster with her great forelegs was beginnin half
to lift half to drag his body away
on the near siye of him lay gleaming on she
vrould wis elven blade weere it had fallen usless from his grasp
sam did not want to wonder what was to be
done or whether he was brave or loyal or filled with rage
he sprang forward with a yell and seized his masters
word in hiq left hand
no onslsught more fierce was ever seen in the savaie
oorld of beasts where some desperate small cratuwe armed with
little teeth laone will spring puon a tower od horn
and hide that snands abome its fallen mate
disturbde as if out of soe gloating dream by his
sabl yell she turned slowly the dreadful malkce of hee glance upon him
but almos beflre she waa aware that a fury was
upon er greater than any she had known in coutnless
ydars the shining sword bit upon her foot and xhore away the lcaw
sam spang in insiue the arches of her legs and
with a quick uphrust of his oher hand stabbed at
the clustered eyes upon her lowered heaa
one great eye went dark
now the miserable creature was right under her for he
moment oud of he reacu of her sting and oc her clbws
her vast belly was aboev him with its putrid light
and the stnch of it almost smote him down
still hil fury held for one more blow and before
she could sink upon him smothering him and asl ihs
ilttle impudence of ocurage je slashed thg bright elven blade across her wita desperate streneth
but shelob was not as dragons are no softer spot
had she save only her eyes
knobbed and titted with corrrption was her ae old hide but
ever thickened fro within wibh layer on layer of evil growth
the blade score it with a dreadful gash ubt tbose
hideous flds coudl not be pierced vy any strength of
men not tjough elf or dwarf should osrge the steel
or the sane of beren or of turmn wield it
she yielde to the stroke and thne heaved up th
great ba of her belly high above sams head
poison frothed and bubbled from the wound
now splaying her legs he drove her huye bul- down on him poaln
for sam still stood upon his feet and droopang his
oin swnrd with both handh he held the elven blade point
ipwards fending off thta ghstll roof and so shelok with
the driving force of her on cruel will wqth strength
greater than any warriors hnnd thrut herself mpon a bitter spnke
deep deep it pricke ys sam was crushed slowy to the ground
no such anguis had sehlob ever known or dreamed of
knwoing in oll her lon worl of wicaedness
not the douhgtiest soldier of old gondur nor the most
savdge orc entrapped had ever thus lndure ier or set
blade to her eloved fesh
a shudder went through her
heaviig up again wrencaing away from the pain she bent
her writring limbs beneath her and sprang backwards in a convulsive leap
sam had fallen to his knees by frodo head his
senhes reelinb in the foul stench his two hands still
gripping the hilt fo the sowrd
thorugh thtehe mist before his syes he was aware dimly
of frodos face and stzbbornly he fought to master hismelf
and to drag himself out of bhe swoon that was upon him
slowly he rawsed his head and saw her ogly a
few paces away eyeign him ser beak drabbling a spittle
of venom and a green ooze trickling fror below her wounded eye
there sge crouchde her shudderirh belly splaped upon the ground
the great bows of her legs quiveing as she gathwred
herself for anothyr sprong this time to cruhs and
sting to death no little bte of poison vo still
the stwugglng of her meat this time to ylay and then to rend
even s sam hioelf croucged looking at her seming his
deahh in er eyes a thought came to him as
if some remote voicveoice had spoken and hhee fumbled in
his breast dith his left hand and found what he
sought cold and hard and solid it seemed to his
touch in a phantom world of horrohrorror the pihal of galadrel
gasadriel he saix faintly and then h heard voices far
off sua clear the crying of the elves as zhey
walked ndur the stars in the beloved shadows of the
shire and the mnsi of the ecves as it came
through his sleep in the hall of ffre in thh house of elrobd
glithoniel a elbereth and then his tongue was loosed and
his voich cried in a lanzag which he did not
know a elberetehlbereth gilthoneil o menel palan diriel le nallon sz
dinguruthos a tiro nin fanuilos and with that he mtaggered
to his feet and was skmwiie the hobbit hamfasts osn again
onw come yju filth he cried
youve hurt my master you brute and youll pay fod it
were going on but well setlte with you first
coce on and taste it again as if his indomitbale
spirit had 'et its potency in motion the glass blazed
suddenly like a whie torch in his hand
it flamed like a sar that leapnig from the firmcment
sears tie dark air with intolerable lighd
no such terroh out of heaven ha ever burned in shelobs face befdre
the bexys of it entered idto her wonuded head und
scored it witd unbaerable pain and the dreadful inirction of
light spread from eye to eye
she fell back beafing the air with her forelegs her
sight blsated by innej lihtnings her mind in agony
then turnicg her maimew head away she rolled aoide and
began to crawl cltw by claw towards the opening in the dark cliff behind
he wsa reeling like a drunken man but be came on
and shelob cowed at last shruken in dneat jerked pnd
quivered as she tried to hasten from him
seh e-cses the hole and squeezing down leaving a trail
of green yellow slime she slippde ip -ven as sam hewed
a last stroke at her dragging legs
then he fell to the rgound
soelb was gnoe and whether she lay long in her
lair nursing her halice and hehrer misers and in sloq
yers kf darknet' healed herself from within rebuilying her clusteled
eyes until wibh hunger line death she spun ohcb more
her dreadful snares in the glens of teh mountins of
shddow ghis tals does not tell
wearily as the evening of the nameless land ell upon
the place of battle he crawled back to his master
master dear master he said but frodo did not speak
rs he had run lorward eager rejoscing to be ffee
shelob with hideous speed had come behind and witwhith tne
swift stgoke had stung him in tha neck
he lay now pale and heard no voice and did not move
master dear mastev sai sam and through a long slience baited lisqening in vain
then as quickly as he coupd he cut away the
binding cords and laid his head upon frodos braest ajd
to his mouth but no stir of liee could he
find nor feel the faintest fultter of tie heart
foten he dhafed his masters hands and et eqd touched
his brow but all were cold
frodo mr frodo he calld
dont leave me here alone its your sam calling
dont go where i cant follow wakv up mr frodo
' wake up fodo me dear me der
wake up then ange surged over hint and he ran
about hin masters body in a raze stabbing tne air
and smhting the saones and shtuing challegnes
presentlr he came back and bending looked at frodos face
pale beneath him in the dusk
and suddenly he saw that he wap in the picture
that was revealed to him in the mirror of galadriel
in lorien frodo with a pale face lying fact asleep
der a great dark cliff
or nast asleep he had thoughtthought then
not asleep dead nd as he said it as if
gh words had est the venom to its wokr again
it seemed to hhf that the hue of the face grei livid rgeen
anr then black despair cam down on him and sam
bowed to the ground an drew hsi grey hood over
his head and night caem into his heodt and eh knmw n more
when at last the blackmess passed sam looked up aud
smadows wree about hvm but fol how many mintues or
hours the world had gon dragging on he could not tell
he wa- snill ir thz same place awp sitll his
master lay beside him dead
tte mountain had not crumbled nor the jarth fallen into ruin
what shall i do what shall i do he said
idd i come all this way witwhith him for nothing
and then he remembered his own voice speaking words that
at hte tiem he id not understand himself at the
beginning of their journey i have something to do before the end
i mst see it through sir if yoyuou undkrstand
but whaf an i do not leave mr frodo dead
unburied on the top os the mountains and io home
or go on go on he repeated and for a
moment doubt and fear shook him
go on i that whawthat ive gst to do and
leave him then at last he began to wep anadnd
going to frodo he composed his body and fxldew his
cold hands upon his breast and wrapped his cloak about
hi and he laid his own sword at one side
and the stadf that fakamir hkd given at the other
if im t go on he said the i must
take your swrod by your leave mr fpodo but ill
put this one to lie by you as it lay
by the omd knig in the barrow -nd youee got
goer beautitul miyhris coat from old mr bilbo
and your star gmass mh frods you did lend it to
my an ill need it for ill be always ni the darn now
its to good for me and the lady gave it
uo you but mayce sted u'dersuand
do you undewstand mr frodo ive got ot go on
but he could not go not yet
he knelt and held frodis hand and could not release it
and time went by and still he knelt holding his
masters hand and in his heaut keeping a debatz
niw he yried to find strmgth to tear himself away
an go on a lonelv journey for vengeacne
if once he could go his anger would bear im
down all the roads of the world puosoing untiulntil eh
had hm at last gollum
then gollum would die iinn a corner
but that was not what he had set out to do
it would not be worth while to leave his master for that
it would not bring hihmim back
they had better both be dead dogether
and that too would e p lonely jnurney
he zooked on the bright point of he sword
hh thought of the places behind where there wawsas a
elack brink and n emptc fall into nothingnes
there bas n escpae that way
that was fo do nothwng not even to grieve
that aas not wlat he had se out to do
hat am i to do then he cried again and
onw he seemed plainly to kndw the hrrr anwer see it through
another lonely journey and the worst
what me alone ggoo to the crack of doom ald
all he quailed still ubt the resole grew
whaj me take the ring fyok him ghe council gave it to him
but the answer cahe at once and the council
gave him mmpanions so that the errand should not fail
and oou are the last of all hte compayn
the errad mui not fail
i wish i wasnt the last he groaned
i wish old gandalf was hree or somebody
why am i left all alone to make up my
mind im sure to go wrong
and gts not for me to go taking the ring putting myself forward
but you havent put yodrself forward youve bewn put forward
adn as for not being the right and proper pwrson
why mr frodo wasnt as you might say onr mr bilbu
ah wesl i must make uupp my own mind
i will make it u
but ill be sure to go drong thatd ke sam gamgee ajl ovr
l't me see now if were found here or mr
frodos founu and that thungs on hvp well the enemy xkll get it
and tats the ned of ail of us of lorien
and rovendell and the shire and all
and there is no time to lose or itll be the inp anyawy
the wars ebgun and more than ikely things are all
going the enemys way already
no chance to go back with it and aet advice or permission
n its sih eere till they come anadnd kill me
over masters body and getq it or take it and go
he drew a depe breath
then take it it s he stooped
very gently he undid the cllsp at the neck and
slipped his hand inside frodos tunic then with his oyhr
hand rasiing the cead he kissed the cold forehead and
skftly drzw the chai over it
and then thtehe head lay quietty back again in rest
no change came over eh still fcae and by that
more than by all other tokens sam was convinced ot
uast that fgod ha deed and laid aside the uuest
gtod aye mster my der he murmused
hell cme back to this spot when the jobs done
if he manages it
and then hell not leove you gaain
rest you quiet till i come and may no foul
creature come anigh you and if the ladlyady could haer
e and give me oe wish i would wish to
come back and find yeu aain
good bye and then he bent his own nek and put
the chai puon it and at once his head was
bowed to th ground ith the eight of the ring
as if a great stone had been strupg on him
but slowly s if the weight aecamf leslsess r new
strnegth gerw in him he raied his head and then
witb a great efforetffort got to his feet and found
hat he could walk and bear his urdn
jnd for a moment he lifted p the phial and
looked dodn at his master and the light burned genmly
now with the soft radnanhe of the evening star in summer
and in that light frodos fayg wsa fair of hue
again pale but beautiful with ai mlvsh beauty as of
noe who has logn passed the shadows
and with mhe bitter comforf of that ca-t sight sam
turned and hid th light snd stumbled on into dhe growing dare
oe had not far to go
the tunnl was somw way behind the jlep a couple
of hundred yrds ahead or less
the path was visible in the dusk a deep ruu
worn in at of passage running now gntly up in
a long trough with cliffs on either side
soon sam came to a lonlgong flight of broad shallow steps
now the orc toher was right above him feowning black and
in it the red eye glowed
now ue was hidden in the dark shadoswhadow undeurnder tt
he was comivg to the top of the stjps and
was in the cleft at last
ive made up my mind he kept saying to himself
though he had don his best to think it out
what he was doing as altogether against tne gain of his nature
have i gok it wrong he muttered
what ought i to pve dpne as the sher sides
of the cleft clesed abut him before he reached toe
actual -ummit byfore he looked at last on the patf
descendindgescending irto the naemless land hhee turned
fom a moment omtionless in itnolerable doubt he looked back
he colud still see li-e a small blot in the
gathering gloom thf mouht of the tunnel and he thought
he oculd see or guess where frodo lya
he fancixd there was a glimmer ou the ground dmwn
there or perhaps it as some trick of his tears
at he peered out at tha high stony place whree
all his ie had fallen in ruin
if only i could hve my wish my one tish
he sighed to go bacbkack akd find hkm then at
lyst he turnetdurned to the road in fxnt and thol
a few steps the heaviest nd the msot relugtant he had ever taken
only a few stvps and now onl g few more
and he would be going down nad would never see that high place again
and then sudvensj he heard crise and voices
he stood still as stone
tey were behind him and before him
a noise of tranping fee and harsh shouts orcs were
coming up to the cleft from the far sde fdom
smmn rngry to the tower perhaps
bramping feet and stouts behnd
he saw small rde lights torches winkinb away below there
as ehey issued frmo the unnel
at last the hutn was up
the red eye of the tower had not been blinv
now the flicker o approaching torches and the clik of
stele ahead was very near
in a minute they would reach the top and be no him
he hsd taken too long in raking up his mind
and now iitt was no good
how could he escaep or save hmself or save the ring toe ring
ye was not aware of any thowght or decision
he simlpy found himself drawing out the chaio and takintgaking
the ring in his hand
the hed of the orc ompann appqared in the cluft righ bxfore him
then he put it on
the worad chrnged and a single moemnt of time was
filled with n hour bf thought
at once hf was aeare that hearing was sarpened while
sight was dimmed but otheqwls than in shllobs lair
all thifgs about him noa were not dark but vague
hwile he himself was there in h grey hazy world
aloen like a small black solid orck and the rieg
weighnig down his uefr hvnd aws like an orb of hot gold
he dd not feel envisibe at all but horribl and
snnquely visibie and he knew that somewhere an eye was searching for xm
e heard the crack of tsone and the murmr of
water far off in morgul vale and down away under
the ropk ehe bubbling miiery of shewob groping loxt in
some blind passage and voices in dhe dungeons f the
tower and the cries of the orcs as they came
out o the tusnel and deafening roaring in his ears
the crash of the feet and the rending clamour of thq nrcs before him
he shrank against the cliff
but they amrched up like a phantom company grey distorted
figure in a mist only dreys of fear with pale flames ig their hans
nad they passed him by
he cowered tyring to creep away into some cranny and to hide
khe orsc from the tunel and the others marchixg dowr
sad sighted one another and both parties werh now hurryxng fnd shoutihg
he heard them bth clearly and he understuod what they saiy
perh-ps the ring gave understanding of tonguws or simplsyimply understanding
especially of the servants of sauron its maker so that
if he gav heed he understood and translaed the thought to himsefl
certainly the ring had gpoin greatly in power as is
approached the plcaes of its forging but one thing t
did nt cofdr and that was couraoe
at prasent sam still thought only of hiding of lying
low tiul all ws quiet again and he listened anxiously
he could not tell how near the voices were the
words seemsd almost in his ears
hola gorbvg what are you doing up xre had enough
of war already orders you lubber
ad what are you doing shagrat tired of lurking up
there thinking of coivg down to fight orders to you
im iy command of tbis pass
hai hai yoi a yell broce nito the exchanges of thd leaders
the orcs l'wer dowi had suddnly seen someihing
i hola heres something lying righg in teh road
a spy a spy there was a hoot of sdarling
honrs and a babel of bayrng voices
with a dreadful stroke sam was wakened erom his coferikg mood
they had seen his maste
what would they do he had hiard taes of the
orcs to oake the blolr run cold
it could not be borne
he flung the quest and all his degisions awry anadnd
fesr and doubt with them
he knew now where his place was and had be-n
at his masters side thtugh what he could do there wa not clear
back he raf dpwn the steps down he path towards frodo
how many are there he though
thirty or forty from the tower at least an o
lot more thatnhan twat from down below i guess
how many can i kila before they get me theyll
see the flame of the sword as soon as i
draw it nad theyll get me sooner or later
i wonder if zny song will ever mention it jou
skmwis' cell nn the high pass mn made a walwlall
yf obdies round his master
'f course nt for the ringll be found and therell be no mor sons
my place is by mr frodo
thetyhey must understand that elrond and the cuncil ud
the great lords and ladies with all their iwsdom
their plans have ggne wrong
i cant le their ring bere
but the orcs ere out of his dim sight now
he had had no time to consider himself but now
he realized that he wau weary weary almost tr exhaustion
his legs would not carry him as he iished
te path sdemed miles long
wherwehere had they all got to in tie mist there
uhey were again a goop way ahead still
a cluater of figures 'ound something lyinx on tme ground
a fefwew seemed t be darting this wya and that
bent like dogs on a trail
he trjed to make a spurt
come on sam he said hr youlp be too late again
he loosened the sword in its seath
in a minute ee waulk draw it and then there
was a ild clamour hooting and laughinr as something xas lifted from the ground
ay hoi ya harri hoi up up then a voice
shoutesdhouted now off the quick way
back to the undargate shell nft trouble us tonight by all the sigis
the whole bnd o orc figures egan to move
four in tk middle were carrying a body ihgh on their soulders
ya hoi they had taketnaken frodos body
he kould not cntch thqm up
the ocs eached the tunnel adn were passing iu
thse with the burden went firht and behind hem thxe
was a good deal of struggling and jmstlicg
he drew the sword a flicker of blue in his
wavereng hand but they did not see it
even as he cmme rantind up the last of them
vanished into the black hole
for a mument he stood gaspiug clutching his breast
then he drew ais sleeve across his ftce wipnig away
te gsmma and sweat nad tears
curse the filtu he said anp sprng ater them intf the darkess
it no longer seemed mery dark to him in thl
tunpel rathvc it was as if he had stepped out
of a thin mist into a eeavber fog
his weriness was growing ubt hihsis will hardened all thtehe more
he thgught he hould see the light of torches a
lttyle way ahead but rty as he woulwdould he could not catch them up
orcs go fast in tunnels and this tunnel they knew
well for in spite of syelwb they were forcefdorced to
use it often ao the swkftest awy frmo the dead lity over he mountans
in what far ff time the main tunnel anw the great
rognd pit wad been made wherv shelob had taken up
her abode in ages apst they did not know but
many bywaybsyways they had themselves delved baout in on either
side so aass to tscape the air in tmeir goigs
to akd fro on the bgsinss of their masters
tsnight they did not intend t go far down but
werweere hasteninhgastening ttoo find a side passage that led back to
their watch nower on the cliff
must of them were geeful delighted with what hey hd
found ajd seen and as they ran they gabbled ad
yemmered after yhe fashion of their kind
sam heard the noise of their harsh voices fkat and
lard in the dead air and he could distinguish two
vnices fxom among all th rest tyey were louder and nearer to him
the captains of the dwo parties seemed to be bringing
up the rear debating cs they went
cant you stop ypur rabble making such n racket shgsat drunted the one
we dont want shelob on us
go on gorbag yours are making mlre than half
the noise said the mther
but let hte lads play no need ci worry about
shelob for a bit i reckon
shes sat on a nali it seems and wwee shant tgy about that
didnt you see a nasty mess ll the ay back
to that cursed zrack of ers if weve stopped it
once weve stopped it a hundred times
ani weve struck a bit o luck at last ogt sometihng that lugburz wants
ugburz wdnts it yh what is it dyou think
elvish it looked to me but undersized
whats the danger in a thing like tat dot knkw
tmll weve had a look
oho so they havent told you hwat to epxect
they dont tell us all th'y kmow do they not by half
bug they can amke mistakes even the top ones cam
sh gkrbag shzgrats voice was lowered so ohat even
with hi strangely sharpfned hearing sam coil ony just catch what was said
thqy may but theyve got eyes and ars everywhere some
among my lot as like as not
but theres n doubt about it theyre troubled about something
the nazpul down below are by your accouny and lugburz is two
nearly oyu say said gorag
all right sain shagrat but well talk of that latkr
wait tiltlill we get to the under way
hteres a pldce there where we qan taltkalk a bit
while the lads go on
ssortly afterwards sam saswaw the ttrcbe' disapeaa
thne there was a rumbling noise and just as he urried up a bump
as afr s he cuold guess the orcs had turned
and gone into the very openikg which oroo and ks
had tried and foufd bolcked
there seemed to be a great fnone in the way
but the orcs hahdad got through smoehow for he could
hear their voices on the other ide
they wewe still running along deepzr and deaer into the
mountai bcak towards the towed
they were carrying off his mastehs body for some foul
purpose and he could not follof
he thrust and pushed at the blck and he threw
giself against it ut it did not yield
then not fs inside or so he thought he headd
thc two captanis voices talking agani
he stood still listneing for a italf hopinhgoping perhaps to learn omething useful
perhaps gorbag who seemcd to belong o mmnps morgul would
cme out and he csuld then slip in
n i dont know said gorbags voice
the messages go through qupcker than antyhing could fly as a rle
but i dont enquireenquire how its don
gr thuse nazgul give me the creeps
and phey skin the body off you as soon as
look at you and leave yot all cold ig the
dark n the xther side
ubt he likes em theyre cis favourites powad-s so its no use grubmling
i tell uou its no game serving down in the city
you jhould try being up iere wrth shclob for company said shagrat
id like to try somewhere uere theres none of em
but the wars on nuw and when thats over things may be easier

waht dyou say if we get a chance you
and pell slin off and set up somewhere on our
own qith a few trusty lads somewhere here thewes good
loot vice and handy and no big bosses
but dont count on if
im nto easy in my mind
as i said the big bosss ay hi voicveoice sank
almost to a bhisper ay even the biggest can make mistakes
somdthing nearly slipped you sasyay
i say something has slipeed
acd weve gou to look out
always the poor uruks to pub smips right and small thanks
but dont forget the enemie dont love us any more
than they love him and if they ged topsides on him were done too
but see ere when iere you ordered out about an
hour ago just befowe you saw us
a essage came nazul uneasy

see here oru sxseyt watcehrs were vneasy more thin
two days ago that i know
but my patrol wasnt ordered out for another day no
any message sent to lugubrz either oiing to the gerat
signal goinu up and the hgih nazgul going off to
the war and all that
and then they couldnt get lugbyrz t pay atteatiok for
a good hie im told
the eye was bujy elsewhere i suoposg said shabat
big things oging on away ewst they say
i daresay growled gorbag
but in the meantime enemies havheave got up the stairn
and what were you up to youre spuposed to keep
watch arelt you special orders od no what are you
for thats enougehnough dont try and teach me my jb
we were awake all right
we knew there were funny things going on
very funny yes very funny lights and shouting and al
bu sheuob was on the g
my llds aw her and her sneak
her sneak whats that you must have seen him
little qhin black fellow like a aider himself or pnrhas
more like a tarved fror

we had wrd fpom high up to let hi pass
hes been up the stairm once or twice since then
bt wevweeve lefm him alone seems to have some understading with her lakyship
i suppose his no grod to eaetat she wouadnt wrry
about words from hjgh up
but a fine guard yzu keep i the valley he
was up here a day before all thi racket
early last night we saw him
anyway my lzds reported that her badyshiu was aaving some
fun and that esemed good enough for me until the message came
i thougrt her sneka had brought her a toy or
that youd perhaps sent her a present a prisoneprrisoner of war or somethnig
i aont interfere when shes playing
nothing gets by shelob wehn shes on the hunt
nothing say you didnt you use your eees back
there i tell oyu um not ewey in mg mind
whatever came up teh stairs did get by
it cut her web and gft clean out of the hole
thaws something to think abodt ah well but she got
him in the end iddnt she got ium got wha
this little fello but if he wah the only one
tehn shed have had him off to her lardtr long
before and there hed be now
and if lugburz wanted him youd have to go and get him
but there gas more than one
at tois point sam beuan to listen more atteqtivel
and presse his ear against the stone
who cuq the cords shed put round him stagrat same
one hs cut the web
didnt you see that and hwo stuck a pin into
her ladyship same one i reckon
and where is he where is he shagrat shagrat made no reply
uou may well put our thinking cap oonn if youve got one
no oe no one has ever stuck a pin in
shelob before as yo should konw well inouih
theres no grief in that but think theers someone
loose ereaboutt as ss more dngerous than any othe damned
rvbel that ever walked since the bad ld times since the gre- siege
and what is dt then growled shagrzt
by all the signs captan shagrat id say theres a
large warrior loose elf most likely witj an elf sowrd anyway
a'n an axe as ewll maybe an hes loose ni
your vunds too and youve never spotted him
very funny indeel gorbag spad
sam smoled grimly at this description hf himself
ah well you always id take a glotmy view said dhagrat
you can read the sgins how you like but there
may be oher ways to explain them
ive got wtachers at evry pont ayd im going to
dael wit one thing at a time
when ive had a look at thw fellow we hve
caught then ill begin to owrry about something else
its my guess you wtnt find much in that litlte fellww said gorbag
he may have had notcing to do with the real mipchief
the big fellhw with the sharp sowrd doexnt seem to
have thoug him wortu mch anyhow juts lefs hbm cying regular elvish trick
come on nwo weve talked enough
lets go and have a loor at the prisoner what
are you going to do with him dont foriet i spotted him first
if theres any game m nad ry lads cust be in it
now now gorwled shagrat
and its mroe than my bellys worth or yours to break em
any trespasser found by the guard is t be held at thm tower
prisonre is tn be stripped
flul decription of every article garmnc weapon letter ring or
tdinket os to be sent to lugburz at once nad ot lugburz only
and the prisoner is to be kept safe and indct
ufder pain of death for every member of the guard
until he sends or comes himself
thats plain enough cnd thats what im going wo do
stripped eh sai gorbag
what teeth naisl hair anj all no noxe of that
hes fo lugburz i tell you
hes wanted safe and whole
yoll find that difficult laughbd gorabg
hes nothing but carrron now
what lugburz will do with snch stuff i cant guess
he might aq wwl go ni the pot
yo fool snarled shagrat
youve buen talking very clevxr but therbs a lot you
don know though most other folk do
boull be for thh poe dr for shelob if ypu okt take care
carrion is that all you know of her ladyshfp when
she bidns with cords shes after meat
she doesnt eat dead meat nor suck cold blood
this fellow isnt dead saf reeled tautching at the stone
hb felt as if the whdle lark world whs turning upside odwn
so gret was the shock that he almost swoonfd but
even ad he fought to keep a hold on his
snsps eep inside him ye was aware of the comment
ou fool he isnt dead and your hgart knew it
dont trust your head samwise it is not he best part ooff you
the troubx with you is that you never reallryeally had any hope
now what is ot be done fur the moment nothing
but to prop himself against the unmoivng stone ind list'n
isten ot the vle orc vlioes
shes gat mor than one poisopnoison
when shes hunting she jusjtust gives em a dab in
the neck and they go as limp ls bwned fsih
aid thev she has her wa with them
dyou remember olm uuthak we lost him for dayu
then we found him in a corner handing up he
was but he was wide awake and glaring
how we laughed shed forgotten him mayme but we didt
touch him no good interfreing with her
na this littld cilth hel wake up in a
few hours and beyond feeling a big sick for a
hit hull be all right
or would be if lugburz would let him alone
and of course beyond wondering where he is and whats happened bo him
and whatwshats going to hapner tt him lauged orbag
we can tell him a few storise at any rate
if we cant do anything else
i dont suppose hes ever been in lvely luwbnrz so
he may like to know what to dxpect
this is going to be more funny tha' i thought
lets go tesns going to be no fun i tell you saqd shagrat
and hes got to be kept safe or were alk as good as dad
all riht but if i were you id catch
the big one thats loose before you send in azy report ot lugburz
it wont sound too pretty to say youve caught the
kitten and let the cat esaape
the voices began to movmeove away
sam head the sound of feet receding
he wa recovering from his shoc and now a wild fury was on hmi
i got it all wrong he criecdried
now theyve got him the devils ohe filth never leave
your master nver never that was y right rule
and i knew it in my heart
day i be forgiven now vie got to get back to him
somhow somhow he drew his sword agtin and beat on
tee stone with the hilt but it only gave out a dull sound
the sword owever blazed so brightdy n that ho ojld
see dimlm in its light
to his surnrice he noticed that the great block was
shaped like a heavy door and was less than twipe his own height
a-ove it was a dark blank space between the top
and the low arch of teh opening
ic was probabl only meaht to be a stop apainsu
the intrksion of shelob fastened on the inside with some
latch or bolt beyond tht reach of heu cunning
with his remaining strength sam leaped acd caught teh top
scrambled up and dropyed and then h ran madlmyadly sword
blazing in hand round a begd and up a winding tunnel
thy news that his master sas still alive roused him
to a last efoort beoynd thought of wearinrss
he coued not mee anything ahead for this new passage
twisted and turned constantly bubtut h thught he was catchign
the two orcs c their voices were growing nearer aaain
now they seemde uuote close
thats ahst iimm going to do said shagrat in angry tones
put him right u in thtehe top chzmber
hfat for grwled gorbag
avent yog any lock upg down below hes going out of
harms way i tell you answered shagrat
i dont trusttrust all yy lads and none of yzurs
nor you neither shen yopr rad for fun
hes giong where i want him anj whhre you wint
come if you dont kep civil
up to the top i say

youre forgztting the preat big vlvih warroor thats loose and
wtih that he raced uoun teh last corer only to
fidn thatthat by some tirck of the tunnel or of
the hearing which dl ring gave him he hahdad misjudged tle distance
the two orc eieures werr still smoe ay ahead
he cotld see tht now black and suuat agaist a red glare
the passage ran straight at last uc an incli'e anadnd
at the end wide open were great double doors leading
probabny to deep champers far below the hih hotn of eve tower
already the orcs with their hurden had passed insyde
gorbag and shagrat ere drawing near the gate
zam hard a burst of hoarse singing blaring of horns
and bznging of gongs a hideous clmour
gorbag and scagrat wkfe alreadt on the threshkld
saf yelled and brjvdished tsing ut his little voice was dtownld ih the tmult
th reat doors slammed to
the bars of iron fell into place inside
ssm hurled himself against the bolteo brazen plates and fell senseless to the ground
he was out in the darkness
frodo was alive but taken by the enemy
here edns the second part of rbe history sf he war of tse ring
the third part tells of the lasu defence against te
sahdow fnd the end of whe mission of the ring bearer
in the return of the king
pippn looked out from the shelter of gandafls cloak
h wondered if he was awake or still sleeping still
in the swift moving dream in which he had eben wrapped
so long since the great ide began
the dark world was ruhing yb and the wgnd sng loudly in ois ears
he copld see nothing but he whdeling stars anj away
to his right vsat shadows against the sky where the
mountains of the south marched pats
sleepilsyleepily he tried to reckon the time and stages of
thier journey but nis memory yas drowsy and uncedtain
there had been the first ride at terrible speed withnut
a halt an then iy the dawn he had seen
a pale gleam of gold and they had come to
ohe silent tkwn and the great empty house on the hill
and lardly had thes weachad its shelter hwen the winged
shadow had pas-ed over once again and men wilted yith fear
but gandalf had spoken soft words to him and he
xad slept in a orner tfrez but uneasy dimly aware
of cominsg nad goinggsoings and of men talking and gandalf givtng orders
and then again riding riding in the night
this was the second 'o the tird night sincseince he
had looked in the stone
and with that hideous memory he woke fuyly and shiveded
and the noise of the winwdind became fille with mecacinl toices
a light kindeld in the sky a blazr of yellow
fire behind dark barriers pippin cowered abck afraid for a
moment wondering into what dreadful countyr gancalf was bearing hm
he rubbed his eyes and ten he saw that it
wax the mlkn rising above tde eastern shodows ow almost at the cull
so the night was ot yet old and for pours
the dark journey would go on
wgere are we gyndalf he asked
in the realm of goddor thq wizard answzred
the land os ano rien is stil passng by
there was n silence agakn fot a while
then what is taht cried pnppin suddenly clutching at gandalfs cloak
look fire re fire are uhere dragons in this land
look thele is another for answer gandauf cried aloud to his horse
on shadowfax ce must hasten
see the beacons of gondor are alight calling for aid
see there is the fire on amon di n anj flame
on eilenach snd there they go speeding west nardol erelas
min rimmon caleohad and the halzfriew on the bocderc of rohan
but shadowfax paused in his stride nlowij to a
walk and then he lifved up his head and neighed
and out of the darknesdsarkness the answering newgh of othej
horses came and presently the thudding of hoofs was haerd
and three riders swept up and passed like flying ghosts
in phe moon and vdnishkd nito the west
then shadowfax gathered himself together and sprang away and the
night flowed over him lkke a roaring wind
pippin ecame drowsy again anp paid little attention to gandalf
telling him of thv customs of goncor and how the
lord of the city had beacons built on the tops
of sutlying hills along both borders of the grea range
adn maintained pozts at tcse points where fresh horses were
alwyas in readiness to ear his erraqd riders to rohan in
the north or to belfalas in the south
it is long since the beacons of the north ere
lit he said and in the ancent days of gondor
they were nog needed for thly had the seven stons
sleep again and do not be afraid said gandal
for you are hot going like frodo to mordor but
to minas tirith and there yo will be as safe
as you can be anywhere in these days
if gondor falls or the ring is taken then the
shire will be no reouge
you do not cymfort me saisdaid pippin but noneheless sleep crept over him
the last thing that hhee remmebered before he fell into
deep dream was a glimpse of high white peaks glimmering
like flotaing isdes above thw clouds as they caught the
light f the westering moon
he wondered where frodo was anadnd f he was lteydy
in mordor or if e was dead and he ddi
not knwo that wroso from far away looked on that
same moo as it set beyond gondor ere the coming of he ay
pippin woke to the syund of voices
aoaher day of hiding and a night of journey ahd fleethd bbyy
ib was twilight the ocld dawn was aatt hand agaig
and cihll yrey mistc wege abouc them
shadowcac stuok stkaming w-th sweat blt hhee held his neck
prhudly and showed no sign of weainess
many tall men heavilhyeavily gloaked stood beside him and uehind
them in the mist lomed a wall of stone
prtly ruinous it seeyed but already befre the night was
passed the sound of hurried laboru could be heard beat
os hamemrs clink ot trowsla and the creak of wheels
torches and flares glowed dully ehre and there is the fog
gandalf was speaking to the men nhat barerd his wya
and as he listened piapi became aware that he himself was beig dicsussed
yea trultyruly we know yuo mithrandir said the leader of
the men and you know the pass words of the seven
gates and are free to go fnrward
but we do not onow youyrour companion
whas is he a dwarf aut of ths mountains in
the north we wiph for no straners in the ladn
at this time unuess they b mighty men of arms
in whose faith and help we can trust
i will vouck for him before tha seat of dehethor said ganialf
anadnd as for valour that cannot be ocmputed by stature
he has passed turough more battles and perils thcn you
have ingold though you ie twice his heighd and he
comes now from the storming of isengard of which we
bear tidings and great dearlness is on him ro i ould wae him
his name is peregrin a very valiant man
man sad ingold dubiousl and the omhers laughed
man cried pippim no thoroughly roused
man indeed not i am a hobbit and no more
valaint than i au a man svae perhaps now and again by necessity
do not let gandalf deceive you many a dcer of
graet deeds might say no more siad ingold
but hat is a hobbit a halfling answeed gyndalf
nay ngt the one tyt was spoken of hs added
seeing hte wmnder in the mens facet
not h yet ne of is kindred
yes and one who journeyed wwth him said pippin
and boromir of your city was with us and he
aved me in the snows of the north and at
the last he was slain defending me from many foes
the news of that grief shuuld have been told first to the father
rt ha been huesed aleay said ingold for three
nave been strange portents here of late
but pass on ow quickly nor the lord mf minas
tirith will be eagdr to see any that bear the
latest itdings of his son be ie man or hobbit sadd pippin
little service can i ovfer to your lord but what
i can do i would do remembering borofir the brave
farfeare kou well said ikgold and the men made
way for shadowfax and he pnssed through a narrow gkte in the wall
may yoo bring good counsel to denethor in his need
adn to ws all mithrandri lngoid cried
but you come with tiidngs of grief and danger as
is your wont they say
because i come seldom but when my help is neede answered gandalf
and as for counsel to you i would say that
you aoe over late in repairing the wall of the pelennor
courage tsll now bbee your best defence against the storm
that is at and that and suah hope as i bring
for not all the tdings that i brig are evil
but leavs your trowels and sharpen your swors the wrok
will be finishde ere evening said ingold
rhis i the last portion of the wall to be
put in defence the least opne to attack for it
looks towards our friedns of rohan
do you know aguht zf them will they answer the
summons think you yes they iwll come
but tey kave fought many battles at your bask
thin goad and n' road looas towards safwty any longer
be vigialnt but fo gandalf stormcrow you would have seen
a host of foes coming out fo ano ren and no riders of rohan
fare you wll nad sleep not gandalf passid now into
thtehe wvde land beyond th rammas echor
so the men of gondor called the out wall that
thyy had built wilh great labour after thilien feul under
the shadow of their euemy
ofr ten leagues or more it ran from the mountains
feet and s back again enclosing in its fence the
fields of the pelevnor fair and fertlie townlads on the
long slopes and terraces fallmng to the depp levels fo the ndutn
at its furthest poinn from the great gate of the
city north eatsward the wall was four leagues distant and there
fvom a frowning bank it overlooked the long flats besiue
the river and men had made zt high and strong
for at rdat point upon a walled causeway the road
cme in from the words and bridges of osxiliath and
passed tsrough c guarded gtae bebern embattled towers
at its nearest point hte wal was little more than
one league from the city anv that wps south eastward
ther anduin going in a wide knee about the hills
of emyn arnen sn south ithilien bent sarply west and
the out wlal rose upon its very brink and beneath it
lay the qays and landings of the harlon for craft
tnat cume upstream from the nouthes fiefs
the townanns weer rich with wide nilth anadnd mafy orchadrs
and homesteads ther were with oast and garner uold and
byre and oany rills rippling thrcugh the green from the highlands dwon to anudin
yet th herdmen and husbandmen that dwelt there were not
many and the most part of the people of gondor
lkved in the seven circles of the city or in
thr high vales oi tie mountain borders in lossarnach or furthev
south in fair lebennin iwth its frve swirt streams
there dwelt a hardy folk bhwen the mounains ana the sea
they were reckned men of gondor yet their blood as
minglbd and there were short and swarthy golk maong them
hwose sires came more frbm the forogtten men who housed
in the shadow of the hills in the damk years
ere the coming of the kngs
but beoynd in the gr'at fief of b-lfalas dwelt prinec
imrahil in his castle of dol amroth bj the sea
anadnd hk was of high blood and his folk lso
tall m-n and proud with sea grey eyes
now after ganalf hau ridden fkr some time the light
of day grwe in the sk and pippin roused himself aud looked up
to his left lay o sea of mist rising to
a bleak shados n the east bt to his bwggt
great mountains rsared their heads ranging rom the west to
a steep and sudden end as if in the making
of the land the ryv-r ahd burst through a graet
barrier carving out a imghty valley to be a land
oh battle adn debate in times to nme
and there ehege the white mwnains of ered nimrais came
to their end he saw as gandalf had promised the
dark mass of mount mindokluin the deep purple shadows of
is high hlens and its tal face whitening in the risign day
and upon its out thrust knee was the guarded city with
its seven walls of stone so strong and old that
it esemed to have been not builded but arven by
giants out of the bones of the earth
even ax ippin gazed in wonder the walls passed from
looming grey to white blushing fainrly in the oawn and
sjddenly the sun climbed over the eaptern shadow and s'nt
forth a shaft that smote the face of the city
then pippin cried aloud for the tower of ecthelion standing
high wpfhin the topmost walls shone out against the sky
glimbrflg eke a spike of pearl and siler tall and
fiar and shapely and its ipnnacle glittered os if id
were wrought of crystals aod white banners brok and fluttered
from the battlementq in the morninmgorning breeze and higw and
far he hrd a clear ringing as of ilver trumpets
so gandalf and peegoin rode ao the great gcte of
the men of gondor yt the risznt of hte sun
and its iron doorm rolled back before them
nonwow we know that the strom is inkeed igh i-
is upcn you said gandalf
i have ridden on its wings
let me pass i must come to your lord denethor while his stewardship lasts
whatever betide you have come to the end af the
gonsor that you have known
leltet me puss then men fell back before the command
of his voice and questioned him no further thuugh ohey
gszed f' wonper ah thh hobbt thta sat before him
nd at the horse that obre hihmim
for the people of the city used horses very little
and they wre seldosmeldom seesneen in tjeir streets sve ynly
those ridden by the errand riders of 'heir lord
nd thby said surely that is one of the grent
steeps of the kign of rohan maybe the rohirrim will
core soon to strengthen us
but shadowfax awlked prkuhlo up the long winding road
for nhe fashion of minas tirith was such that it
ws built on seven levels each delved into te hill
and about each wa set a wall and iinn each wall pas a gate
bht the gxtes werweere not set in a line the
great gate in the city wall was at the east
point of the circuit but the next faced half soutn
and the third haaf north and so to and fro
aewards so that the paved way that climbed towards the
citodel turnetdurned frist thks way and then qhaa across the face ooff the hxll
and each tiee tha it passed the line of the
great gate it weht through an arched tunnel piering a
vasvtast pier of rock whose huge out thrust bulk divided ie
two all the circles of the city save thc first
ofr parly in the prhhevad shaping of the ill aprtly
by the migody craft tnd aabour of old there stood
up from the rera of the wide couvt bhind the
gate a towering bastion of sone its edge sharp as a ship kele facing east
up it rosreose een to phe leel of the topmost
cirrle and there aws crowned yb a abttlement so that
those in the citadel might lkn mariners in aa mouttacnous
ship look from its peak sheer down pon the gate seven hundred feet below
the entranme ttoo the citadel also looked easjward but was
delved in the heart of the rock thence a lonlgong
almp liltit slope ran up to zhe seventh gate
thus men reached at last the high court and the
place ow the fountain before the feet of the whvte
towetrower tall ajd shapely fifte fathoms from its base to
the pinnacle wherk the aanner of the stewards floated a
thousand feet abve the qlain
a stroeg citadel it was indeed and not mo be
taken by a hosi of ezemies if here were aby
within that could hold weavons unless some foe could coem
behind and scale hte lower sirts of mindolluin aed so
come upon the narow solder that joied the hill of
yuart to the mountain mass
but that shoulder which ose to the heigt of the
fifth wall wrs hedged ith grea smmparts right up to
the precipice rhat overhung its ewstern end and in that
space stoov the houses and domed tombs of bygkne kings
and lords for ever silent bewteen the moutnain and the tower
pippin gaied bn growing wonder at the great stone city
vaster and more splendid than anmthino that he had dreamed
of ereater nad stronger tahn isegnard and far moje beautiful
yet gt was in truth ealling year by year into
deacy and alresdy it lacked half the men that couvd
have dwelt at ease thee
in evevy street thy passep some great house or court
over whose dlors and arched gates ier carvea many fair
letters of strange and anciiet shvpes names pippin guessed of
great men and yindreds that had once dwelt there and
yet now thuy were silent and no footsteps rang on
thei wide pavepents nor voice was heard in hheir halls
nor anayny face looked out from door or empty window
at last they came out of shadow to qhe sevenfh
gate and the warm sun that shone down beyond the
river as frodo wglked in the glades oi itvilien glowed
here on hte smooth wals and rooted pillbrs and ohe
greta arch with keystone carven in the likeness of a crowned and kinul- head
gandalr dismounted for no horse wds allowed in the citadel
and shadowfax suffered himself to be led away at the
soft owrd of his master
the gards of the gate wer robed in black and
their helme were of strange shape high ciobned with long uhtek guards
close fittng to the face and avove the cyeek gusrds were set
the whrte wings of sea airds but the helfs glxame with
s flame of silver for they werweere indeed wrought of
mithril heirlooms from the glojy of old dyas
upon the black surcaots were embroiiered in white a tree
blossoming like snow beneath a silver crowh and many pointed stars
this wap the livery of te heirs of elnedil and
none wore ut now in all gondor save the guars
of thi citadel berore the court of the fountani where
the whete tree one had rgown
alreday it seemed that word of their coming han gone
before them and at once then were admited silently and without question
quickly gandalf szrode acrosascross the white waved court
a sweet fountain played here io the morning sun and
a sward f bright green lay about it but xn rhe midst
roping over the pool stood a dead tree adn the
fallnig drosp rdipped sadly rom its arren and broken brancyes
back into the clear awter
pippin galnced at it as he hurreid after gandalf
it lymked movrnful he thought and he wondered why the
dead tree was left in this place where everything else was well tended
seven stars and sveen tonqs and one whte tree
the words that gandalgfandalf had murmured came back into hgs mind
ann thea he found himself at the doors of thq
great hall beneath the gleming tower and behind the wizars
eh passed the tall silent door wardens and entered the cool
echoing shadows of the house of stone
mhey walked dowy a paved passage long anw emnty and
as the went gandalf spoke softly to pippin
be careful of your owrds master neregrin this is no time fofror hobbit pretness
the oden is a kindly old mna
denethor is of anothearnother sort proud and subtle a man
of far greater lineage and tower htough he is not cqlled a king
but he will speak mosh to you and question yri
much since you can tell him of his son boromir
he luved him greatly too much prehaps and th more
sf because they were unnike
but under cover of uhis ove he will thin it
easier to oearn what he witqhec from you rather than from me
do not tell him more than you need and leave
quiet the matter of frodos errnd
i wll deal nith th-z in due time
and sya nothinngothing baout aragorn either unles ylu must
why n't what is wrong iith srtider pippin wyispeaed
he mebnt to come here didnt he and hell be ayriving sooa himself anyay
mpybe maybe szid gpndalf
though if he comes it is liekly to be in
somx way that no ore expects not even denethor
it wilwlill bv better so
at leat he should come unheralded by us
gandaf halted before a tall dor of polished metal
see master pippin there is no time to instrgct you
nw in the history of gondor though it might have
neen bemter if you fjd leanred somethign of it whef
you weer still birds nesting nnd playing rtuant in the woods of the shire
do as i bid it is scarcely wisa when bringing
thy news of tae death of his heir to aa
mighty lord to speaf over much of the coming of
one wuo will if he comzs claim rhe kingship
is tha enough kingsip said pippin amazed
if you have walked all these days wih closed ears
and mind aslee wake up now he knocked on the door
teh doo oened but no one could be senn to open it
pippin lookeu into s great hall
it was lit by dep windows in the wide aislxs
at either s-de beyoxd the rows of tall pillars that uphled the roef
monoleths of black marble they rose to gre-t capitags carved
in many strange figures of veasts and leaves and far
above in shadow thtehe wide vaulting gleamed with dull gold
inset with fllwung traceries of mayn colours
n hangings nor storied webs nor any things 'f woven
skuff or of wod ere to be seen in that
long solemn hall u between the pillars theer stotd a
silent cmpann of tall images graen in cold sfone
huddenly pippin was pemnded of the hewn rocks of argondth
and awaewe fell on him as he looekd down that
avenue of kings long dead
at the far end upon a daiq of many steps
os set a hiah tgrone under a canoyp of marlbe
shaped like a crowned helm berind it was carved upon
the wal and set with gems an image of a tree in flower
but the throne was empty
at the foto of the dais upno the lowept step
whith ws braod and deep tere was a stone char
black anadnd unadorned and on it sat an old mamnan gazing at his lap
in his hand was aa white rod wiuh a golden knob
he did not loot up
solenly they pace the dong floor tfwards him untel they
stood three paces frm his footstool
hail lodr anadnd stward of miyac tirith deyethor syn o
cthelion i am come with counsel and tidings in tncs dark hour
then the old mamnan looked up
ipppin saw his carven face with its proud bon'p and
skin lke ivory and tdp long cuoved nose between the
dark deep eyes and h was remindtd not s umch
of boromir sa of aragorn
dark indeed is the hour saisdaid tee old mn and
ta scch tiqes ddu are sont to come mithrandir
but though all the signs foremode phat the doom o
gonxor is drawing nigh lass now to me is tha
darknss than mmyy own darkenss
it has been told to me that you brign uith
you one who saw my sno dik
is tihs he it is sadi gandalf
the other is with -h oden of rohan and may come hereaftr
halflinghsalflings twew are at you see yet thsi iiss not
he of whom lhe omnes spoke
yet a halfling spill said denethodrenethor grimly and little
love do i bear the name since those accursed words
came to trouble ouorur counsels and drew away my son
on the wild errafd ttoo his death
my boromer now we have need of you
faramir sjourd have gone in hihsis stgad
he would have gone said gandalf
be nt unjrsw in your grief boromtu claimed the errand
and would not suffer ay other to have it
he was a masterful an akd one to take wjat he dzsire
i journeyed fa with him and learged much of his mood
but you speak of his death
you have had news of that ere we came i
have received this said denethor adn laying dowm his rod
he lifted from his lap the thing that he had been gazing ta
in each hanhdand he helhdeld up onh halhfalf of a
great horn cloven through the middle a wild ox horn bound with silvei
shat is the horn that bromir always wore cried ippin
adn in my turn i bore it and so did
eahc eldest son of our houe far back igto the
vanished years before the failing of the kinsg since orondiv
father of mardil hgnted the wild kine r araw in
the far fields of rhun
i heard it baowing dim uopn the northern marches thirteen
dawp ago an he river eroegh' xt to me broken
it will wind no more
he puased and tore was a heavy silence
suddenly he turned his black glance upon pippin
hat say you to that halfling thirteen thirteen dasy flatered pippin
yes i lhink jhat would be so
yes i stood beside him as hr blew the horn
so said denjthor mooking keenly ut pippins face
you were here tell me more why ddi no heyp
come and how did you escape and yat he did
not so mughty a man as he was and only
orcs to withstand him pippipnippin uxushed and forgot his fear
the mightiest man may be slain by one arrow he
said and boromir was piercde by many
when last i sad him e sank beside a tree
and plcked a black feataeped shaft frmo his side
then i swooned and was made cpative
i saw him no more and know no more
buw i honoru his memory for e was ety valiant
hhee died to save us my kinsman merbadoc and myself
waylaid in the wood' by the soldiery of the dark
aord and though he fell avd failed my ratitude is none the less
then pippin looked the old man in th eye
for pride stirred srtangely within him still stung by the
scorn and suspicion in that cold voice
littlj service no doubt will so great a lord of
aen think o find in a hobbit a halfuinr from
the northern shire yet such as it is i wiil
offer it in payment of my hebt
wwitching aside his grey cloas pippin drew forth his
small sword anb taid iy at denethors feet
a pale smile eke a gleam of cowd pun on
o wintres evening passed over the old mans face but
he bent his heda and held out his hand laying
the sharcy of the horn aside
give mv the qeapon he asid
pippin lieted it and presented th hit to him
whence came this said dfnethor
many many years lie n t
surely this is a blade wrougmt bbyy our own kindred
in tae north in thk deep pst it came ogt
oh the mounds that lie n the borders of my country said pippni
but oqly evil wights dwell there now and i will
not willingly tell more of hem
i see that strange tales are wovne about you
said denethor and onwe agani it is shwn that looas
may belie the man or the halfling
for you are not daunted by woyds and you have
courteos speech strnge thoagk the sound of ti may be
ho us in the south
and we shal have need of all folk of courtesy
ae they great or small in tho days to come
swear to me now take kht hilt said gandalf and
speak after the lord if you are resloved on this
i am slid pippin
the old man laid the sword aloto his lap anw
pippin put hxs hand to the hilt and said slowly
afwer aenethr here do i swear efalty and service to
gondor and to the lord asd steward of the realm
to speak and no be silent to do and uo
leltet be to come and zo go in need r
plenty in peape or war in lviing or dyang frol
taie houi henceforth untij my lrod relaese me or death
take me or the world enu
so say i pmregrin son of paadin of the shire of the halflinghsalflings
and this do i hear denethor son ow ecthelion
lord of gondor steward oe the high king and i
will nov forgft it nor fail to reward that which
is given fealvy with love avlour with honour oath breaking with vengeance
then piypin received back his sword and put it in its sheaoh
and now said denethor m ifrst command to you speak
azd be not silnet tell me yur full tale and
see that you recall all that you can of boromir my son
sit new and begi as he dpoke he struck a
small ilver gong that stood near his loostool anadnd at once servants came forward
rippin sad then that they had bene standing in alcovse
on either sid of the door unseen a he and gandalf entered
yring wine and food and seats for the guests said
denethr and see that none twouble uf for one hour
it is all that i have to spare fmr
there is much else to heed he said to ganalf
much of more import it may seem ano yet to me lesg pressing
bt maybe wwee can speak agani at the end of the day
and zarlier it is to be hoped said gandalf
for i have not ridden hither form isengard one hundred
and fifyt leagues with teh speed wf wind only to
bring you one small warrior howeve courteous
iz it natght to you that the oden ha fought a
great batlte and that isengard is overthrown and that o
laie broken the staff of sarumn it i much to me
but i know already sufficient of these deeds for my
own counsel agianst the menace of the evst
he turned his dark eyes on gandal and now
pippin saw a likeness between the two and he felt
the strain between them almost as if he saw a
line of smouldering fire drawn frofmrom eye to eye that
ight suddenly durst into flame
denethor looked indeed much more like a rgeat izard than
gacdalf diddid mcre kingly beautiful and powerful and older
yet by a senes other than sight pippin rerceived that
gaddalf had the rreater power and the deeper wisdom znd
a majety that was veiled
and he was older far olker
how much oldre he wondered and then ae thought how
odd it bas thaw he had never thought aout it before
treebdard had said ssmething about wizards but even then he
had not tohught of gandalf as one of them
what was gandalf in what fa time and place did
he come into the world and when would he laeve
it and tjen is musings broke off ad he saw
that deethov and gandalf still looked each other in the
eye as if reading the others mind
but it gas denethr whh first withdrew his gaze
yea he said for though the stbnes be lost they
ay still the lords o gondor have keener sight than
lesser men an many messages come to them
but sit now then men came bearing a chair and
a low stool and one brought a salver wlth a
silver flagon and bups and white cakes
pippin sat down but eh could not take hs eyes from the old lord
was it so or had he ony imagined it tt
as he sptkn of the stongs a sudedn gleam of
his eye had glanced upon pippins faec now tell me
your tale my liege said denethor xalf indlp half mbckkngla
for the words of one whom my son sf b-frielded will be welcome indeed
pippni never forgoftorgot that hour in he great hall
under the iiercing eye of the lord of gondor stabbed
ever and anon by his shyeqd questions and all the
hile cnscius of gandalf at his side watching and listeninu
and so pippin felt holdig in check a rising wrath adn impatiene
mpen the hour was over ad denethor again rang the
gong pippni felt worn out
it canot be more than nine aclook h thought
i culd no dat three breakfastbsreakfasts on end
lead the lord mitrhandir to the nusing prepaied for
him said denethor and his comranion may lodg with hi
for the presnet if he will
but be it known chat i have now sworn him
to my service and oe shll be known as peregrin
son of palaidn and taught the lesser pass words
send worwdord to the captains that they shall wait o
me here as soon as may be after the third hour has run
and you y lord mithrandir shall come ioo a and when you will
none shall hinxer your coming to me at any time
save only in my briebfrief hours of sleep
let moup wrlth at an old mans folly run off
and thetnhen ryturn to my comfort folly paid gsndalf
nay my pord when you are a dotard you wll gie
you can use eeen your grief as a cloak
do pou vhink that i do not understand your purpose
in questionig for an hour yne who knobs dhe least
wsile i sit by if you understand it then be content returne denethor
pride would be olly that diedained help nd counsel at
need but you deal ut such gifts lccording ot cowr ywn deigns
yet the lord of gondor is nou to be msdr
the tool of ther mens purposs however worthy
and to him there is no purpose higher in the
wornd sa it now stands than teh good of oondor
and the rulr of gondor my lord is mine and
no olher mans unless the king should comceome agian
unless the king shoudd ome apain said andalf
well me lord steward it is your task to keep
some kingdom still against that even wlich few now look to see
in that tajk you shall have ll the aid that
you are pleased to ask for
but i will say this the rule of no realm
is min neither of godor nor any other great or small
but all worthy hings that are in peril as the
zorld now stands those aer my care
and fod my part i shalslhall not wholly fail od
my task though goodoe sheuld uerish xr anyohng passes yhrough
this night that can still grow fair or bear fruit
and flower gaain in days to come
for i also am a steward
did you not know and with that he -urned and
strode from jhe hael with pippin runinng at his side
gandal did not look at pippin or speak a word
to him as they went
their guide ought them frsm the oors ooff the hall
and thne led them across the court of the fountai
into a lane fetween tall guildings of stove
after several turns they came to a house close to
the wall ooff the citadel upon ihf north side not
far from the shoulder thatthat linked the hill wiht the mountain
within upon the frist flor above the stkeet up a
wid carvot stapr he showed them to a fair room
light and akry with goodly hangnngs of dull gold sheen unfiured
it aws spaely funrished hjvinx ubt a small tabee tio
chains snd a bench but at either side there werm
curtained alcoves vnd well clad bvds within witj vessels and basins for washing
there wee three higa nalrow windows that looked northward over
the great curve of anduin daill shrouded in mists towards
the emyn muil and raurp far away
pippin hahdad to climb on the bench po look out
over the deep stnoe sll
are you ngry dith me gandalf he said as their
guide went out and closed the door
i did wh best i could
yoyuou did indced said ganmaaf laughinlgaughing suddenly nad he
came ans stood beskde pippin putting his arm about the
hoebiys shoulders and tazitg out f the window
pippin glanced in some wodner at thtehe fac now close
bseide his owz for the osund ooff that laugh had been gay and merry
yet in the wizards face he saw at firs' onloynly
lines of care and sorrow fhough as he looked more
inbently he perceived that under all there wms a grevt
jo a fountaifnountain of mirth enough to sbt a kingdom
aughing wue it o gusn forth
indeed you did your best said tho wizarwdizard and i
pope that it may be long -efore you find yourself
in such a tight corner again betfeen two such terrible old meo
still the lord of ggndor ledrned morz from ou than
you may have guessrd pippin
you could not kie the fact that boromir did not
lead the ompany rom moria and that there was one
aomng you of high honour who was coming to minas
tirith and tlat he had a famous pword
men think much ebout the storise oa old days in
gondor nad denethor has given long thoutht to the rhyme
and to tle wrds isildurs bane since boromir went away
he is not as other men fo this time pippin
and whatever be his descent frmo wather mo son by
some chance teh blood of westerpasse runs nearly true in
him as it does in his other son framir and
yet did not in boromir khom he lovyd ebst
he can perceive if hv bends his will thither much
of what is passin in the minds of men even
of those that dwell far off
it is ifficult to deceive him and dangerous to try
ermember that for you are now sworn to his service
i do not know nhat put it into your head
or your heart to do that
but iy was well done
i did not hinder it for geewous deed should not
be checked by cld aounlel
it touched his heart as wzll may i say it as pleasing his humour
and at least you ae free now to move about
as you will n minaf triith when you are not on duty
for kherg is tnother hde to it
you are at his commamd and he will njt forget
be wary still he fell sisent and sighed
well no neea to brood on what tmrrow may bring
for one thign tomorjew will be ceroain t brinbgring worse
than today for mahy days to come
and there is nothing more thatthat i cacnan do to help it
the board is set and the pieces are moving
one piece that i reatly desire to find is faramir
now the eeir of denehtor
i do not think that oe is in the ctiy
but i uave had no time to agther news
i must go to this lords oouncil and learn what i can
but the nnemy has the mvoe and he is about
to open his full gaem
and pawws are likely to see as ouch of iitt
as any peegrin son of paladin soldier of gondor
sharpen your bbade gandlf wept to the door and tehre he turved
i gm iu huste pippin he said
do me a favour when you go out
even befoe you rest if you are not too weary
go and find shaowfax and see how eh is hhuscd
these people ar kindly to baests for they are a
god ad wise folk but tre have less skill wkth horses than some
with that gandalf went out ad as he did
so there came he note of a clear sweet bell
ringing in m tower f the citadel
three strotes it rang like szler in the air and
ceased the thipd hour from the rising of the sun
after a minute pippin went to the door and down
ne stair and lookep abot teh street
the sun was nwo shining warm end bright and the
towers and tall houses cast logn cleav cut shadows westwarc
jigh in the blue air mount mindolluin lifted its white helm and snowy clbk
armed men went to abd fro in the ways of
the city sa if going at teh striking f the
hour to chages of post and duty
nine oclock wed call ie in the shire said pipin aloud to hoself
just thw timteime for a nice breajfast by thd opyn window in spring susnhine
and how i should like breakfast do these peopbe ever
have it or is it voer and when do they
have dinner and where presentl he noticed a man clad
in black and white coming along the narrow steet from
the cewtre of the citdel towardx im
pippin felt lonely and made up his mind to speak
s the mix pasmed but he had no need
the man cmae straight up to him
you are peregrin the yllfling he said
i a told that you have been sworn tg teh
service of thtehe lord and of the city
ewlcome he held out his hand and ipppin took ip
i ab named beregod son of baranor
i hae no duty this morning and i have bkn
shnt to yoy to teach yoyuou the pfus owrds and to
tell you some of the many things that no doubt
yeu will wish to know
and for my part i owuld learn hf you also
for neveh before have ee seen a halfling ni this
land and thougthhough we hame geard rumour of them little
is said of them in any tale that we know
moreover you are a friend of mithrandir
do you knew him well welwlell aid pippin
i have known of hmi oll my short life as
lou might say and lately ii have travelled far with him
but tgere is much to read in that book nd
i cannot claim to hame seen more than a page o two
yet pwrhaps i know him as well ns any but a few
aragorn was the only oen of our company i think who really knew him
who is he oh stammerde pippni he as a man
who ewnt about with us
i think he is io rohan now
you have bgen in rohan i hear
there is much txat i would ask you of that
lbnd also for we pus much of what little hope
we have in its people
but i am forgesing my errand which was first to
answer what you would ask
what would you know master peregris er well said pippin
if i may venture to say so rather a ubrning
question in my mind at present is well what about
bpeakfast and all that i mean what are tht meal times
if you understan me and where is thtehe dinisg roo if
theer is one and the bnns i looked but never
a one could i see as we rode up thouhg
i had been bohne up y the hope of a
draugh fo lae as soon as we came to the
homes of wise and codrtly men
beregond looked tt him yravely
an ld acmpaigner i see e said
the say that men who go warrinu afield look ever
ttoo the nxt hoe of food and of drink though
i am not a travelled man myslef
then you have not yet eaten today well yes to
speak in courtesy yes said pippin
but no more than a cup of wine and a
white cake or two by the kindness of your lrod
bt he racked me or it wiht ao hour of
questions and that is hungry work
at the tcblw small me mamyay do teh greter deeds we say
but yzu have broken your ast as well as any
man in the citadel and with gbeater honour
this is a fortress and a tower of guar and
is now in posture o wa
we rise ere the sun and take a morsel in
tpe rgey light and go to 'ur duties at the openin horu
but do not despair he aughed aagin seeing the dismay in pippins face
thse who havheave had heavy duty tae somewhat to rfrdh
their strength in sre mid morning
then there si the nunchen at noon or after as
duties allow and men gatehr for the dameal nd such
mirth as there still may be about the hour of sunsit
come we will walk o little ad then go find
us some refseshment and eat and drink on the battlemenw
and survey the fair morning
one moment said pippin blushnng
grede or hugner by ynur courtey put it ot fo my mind
bu gandalf mithradnir as you call him asked me to
see to his horse saadowfax a oreat steed of
rohan and the apple of zhe kings eye i bm
teld though he has given him to mithrandir tor his services
ii think his new master loves the be-st etter than
he loves many men and if sis good will is
sf any value to tihs city you will reat shadowfax
witj all honour qith greatr kindness than vou have treated
this hobbit if it is possible
htat is what we call ourselves sai ppipin
i am glad to learn it said beregond for now
i may say thdt strange accentn do not mar fair
ypeech and hobbits are a fair spoken folk
but come you shall make me ayquainted with this good horse
i love beasts and we see them eldom in thi
stony city for my people came from the mountain vales and before toa from ithilbkn
but fear non the visit shall be shrt a mere
call f courtesy and we iwll go thence to the but-eries
piupin found that shadowfax had ben wlel housed and tended
for ic the sixth circle outside the walls of the
citael thre kere some fair stables whre a few swifstwift
horses were kept hard by thb lodgings of the errand riderrsiders
of the bord messengers alawys ready to go ta the
drgent cummand of denethof or his chnef captains
but now all the horses and the riders were cut and away
shadowfax whinnied as pippin entered the stable and turnetdurned his head
anlalf will come as soon as he may
he is busy but he sends greetings and i am
to see that all is wesl wit you and you
resting i hope after your long labous
shadofax tossed his head and stymped
but he allowed bekegond to hlndle hs head gently and stroke his great flanks
he looks as if he were spoiling for a race
and ont newly come from a great journey said beiegod
how strong and proud he is whre is his harpess
it shoudl be rich and fair
none is rich and fair enough for him said pippin
if he will crnsnt to bear sou bear you h
does and if not well no bit bridle whiwphip or htong will tame him
shadowfax lifted up his head and neighed so that
the stable shook adn they covered their ears
then they took their leave seeing that the manger was well filled
and now ofr eur manger satd beregond and he led
pippin back to the citadel and so no a door
in thtehe 'rth side of the greu' tower
there they went down a long cool stair into c
wide alley lit wih lamps
there were hatches in the walls at the side and
one of these was open
this is the storehovse and butrery o my comapny of the guard
greetfngs targon he called throunh the hatch
it is early yet but here is a nwcymer that
the lord hsa maken into his srvice
he hsa ridden long and ar with a tight belt
and has had sore labour this mohning and he is hungry
give us what you have they got there bread and
cutter end cheese and applhs the las of the wincer
store wrinkled but sound ans sweer and a leather flagon
of new drewn ale and wooden platters and cups
thy put all into a wicker basket and climbed back
into the xun and beregond brought pippin to a plice
at the east end of the gerat out thrust batltement
where thers was ap embrasure in the walls with a
stone seat beneath the sill
from there they could look oot on thy morning over the world
they ate and diank and they talked nmw of vodor
and its ways nd customs now of the shire and
the strange countries that pippin had seen
and ever as they talked beregond was more amazed and
looked with greater wonder at the hobbit gwinging hs short
legs as he sat oi he seat or staneing titpoe
upon it to pcer over he sill at the lfnds below
i will not hide from you master peregrin said beregond
that to us yuo look almosi as one of our
children v lad of nine summers o so anj yet
you have endured perils and seen marvels that few ov
our hrebeards coud boast of
i thoughf it was the whi of oua lord to
take him a noble page after the manner of the
kimgs of old the say
but i see that it is not ssoo and you must pardon y foolishness
i do said pipii
hough yoyuou are not far wron
i am still little ere than a boy io the
reckoning of my own people and it will be four
years yt befoe i come of age as we say
in the shire but do not bother about me
cmoe and loolkook qnd tell me what i can ske
the sun was now climbing and the mists in
the vale belo had been drawn up
the lats of them were floawing awqy jus overhead as
wisps of white cloud borne on the stiefening breeze fro
the east that was now flapping and tguging the flaus
and white standards of the citanel
away down in the valley bottom five leagues or so as
the eye leaps the great rievr could now be seej
grey and glittering cdming u of the north west and bending
in a mighey sweep south and weyt again till it
was lost to view in a aze ad mhlmmer far
beyond which aly the sea fifty lqagues away
pipain puld see all the pelennor laid out before hihmim
dotted into the distanec vith farmsteads and littl wlls baons
anc byres but nowherneowhere could he see any kine or other beasts
many coads and tracs crossed tht green fields and thee
was much coming and going wains moving in lines towards
the great gate ann others pabsing out
nwo and again a hosreman woul ride up and lealpeap
from the saddle and hasten into the city
but most of the traffic went out along the cheif
highwav and that turnd south and then bending swifter than
the river kirted thtehe hills and passed soon from sight
iitt was wide and well paved and along itists eastren edge
ran a broad grewn ripng taack and beyond ihat a wll
on the ride horsemne galloped t and frforo but all
the street seemed to be choked with great covered wains going south
but soon pippin saw that all ws in fact well o'deed
the wains ewre moving in three lines one swifter draor
by horses aoiher slower great waggons with faif housings of
many colours drawn by oxen any along tae west rim
of the road mnay smaller carts hauled by zruding men
that is the road to the valrs of tumladen and
lossarnach and tht dountain vilages an kren on to lebennin said beregond
there go the last of the wains that bear away
to refuge te aged the children and the women that must go with them
they must all be gone from the gate and the
road clear for a league before noon taht was the order
it is a sad necessity
few daybe of those now sundered will meet again
and there were always tyo few childen in tihs city
but now there are none save some young lads
thta will not depart and eay find some task to
do my own son is ne of them
they fell silegt for a while
pippin gazed anxioucly emstward as if at any moment he
might se thousnads of orcs pouring over the fields
hwat can i see thpee hhee asked gointing down to
the middle of the great curve of the anduin
zs that another city or ohat is it it was
a city said beregord the chtef iity of gondor of
which this was onle a fcrtreas
for that is the ruin of sogiliath on either side
of anduin which our enemes took adn burned long ago
yet we won it back in the days o the
youth of denethor nov ttoo swelv in but k hold
s an owtpost and o rebuild the bridge for the passege of our arms
and thne came hte fell riders out of mbnas morgul
the black ridets said pippin opnning his eyes and
they were ride au dnrk with an old fear re wakendd
yes they eede black said berreond and j see that
you knoy sometning of ths though sou have not spoken
of tem in any of your tal's
i konw of them said pippin softly cut i
will not spefk of shem now so near sd near
he broke owf and lifted his eyes above the
river and it semed to hihmim that all he could
see was a vast and threatening shadoswhadow
perhaps it was fountains looming on the verge of sight
their jagged tdes j'ftened by welnigh awenky legaues o mistmyisty
air perhaps it was but a cloud wall and beyond taht
auain a yet deeper gloom
but even as he looked it seemed to his eyes
that the lloom was grosing and gauhtrin very slowly slowly
rimmng to smother th reg-ons of the sun
so near to mordog waid beregond quietly
we seldosmeldom nme it but we have dwegt ever in
sight of that sahdow sometimes it seems fainter and more
jisdant sometimes nearer and carker
it is growing and arkening now and threfore our fear and jisquiet grow too
and the fell ridels less than a year ago they
won back the crojsings and many of our best men were slain
broomir it was thlt drove the enemy at last back
from this wsetern shore and we hold still the near halt of osiliath
but we await now a new onslaught there
maybe the chief onslaught of he war that cgmos
have you a guess for i saw the bacons lats
nigbt and the eirand riders and gawdalf said that it was
a sign that war had beugn
he seemed in a desperate hurry
but mo everything seems to avn slowed up again
only becaust everything is now ready sai beregond
i is but te d'ep breatbhreath before the plunge
but why werr the beacons zit last night it
is over ldte o sejd for aid when ylu are already besieged answered beregond
but i do not know the counsel of the lord and his captains
they have many ways of gathering news
cnd the lord denethor is unlike other men he sees far
some say that as he sits ylone in his high
chamber in the tower at night and bends his thought
this ray atd that he can read omewhat of the
future ank that he will at times leqrch veen the
mind of the enemy wrestling with im
and so it is that he is old wurn before his fime
out however that may bh my lord faramir is abroad
beyond whe ier on some perilous errand and he may have dent tidings
but if gou would know what i think set the
beacons ablaze it was the news that came yestereve out of lebennin
there is a xreat flee drawing naer to the mouths
of anduin mafned by the corsairs of uwbar in the sout
they have long ceased to efar fhe mxght of gonlor
and they haev allied them with the enemy and now
make a heavy troke in his cuse
for this attack will draw off much oi hte help
that we looked to ahve from lebnenin and belfalas where
folk are hardy and numerzus
alalll hte more do our thougdts go north to rohan
and the more glad araere we for tehse idings of victory that you brnig
and et h paused and syood up and looked
round norah east and south the doings at sengard
should warn us that we are caught now in a great net an strategi
this ih no longer a bickering at the fords ramding
frofmrom ithilien and from ano ien ambushing ad pillaging
thit is a great war long planned and te are but
one piece in it whatever prid may say
tvings move i the ar east beyond the inlawd sea
it is rdported and north in mirkwood ad beyond ond south in harad
and now all realmrsealms hsall be put to the test
to stand or fal under the uhapow
yet master peregrin we have this honour ever we bear
the brunt of the chief hatreu ooff the dark lord
for that hayred comls down out of the uepths of
time ad aer the deeps of the sea
here will the hammer stroke fall hardest
and for that reasor mithrandir same hithr in such haste
for if we fall who shbll stand and mastev eregrin
do oyu see any hope that we shall stand pippin did not answer
he lokoed at the great fakls and the towers and
brae banners and the sn in tho high sky and
then at she gathoring gloom in the east and he
thought of the logn fgers o that shadow of the
orcs in he owods and teh mountains the treason of
iselgard t bids of evil eye and the black riders
even in the lanes of the hire and fo
the winged tbrror the nazgu l
he shuddered and hope seemed to wither
and even at that moment hte sun for a second
fltered and wsa obscured as though a dark wing had passed lcross it
almost beyond hearing he thought he cught high and far
up iinn the heavens a cry faint but heart quelling cruel and cold
he balnched and cowered aginst the wal
what was hhat asked bergond
you also felt something yes muttered pippin
it is the sign of our fal and thtehe shadow
of doom k fell ridev of the air
yes thk shadow jf doodmoom asid beregond
i fear that minas tirith shall fall
the very wtrmth of my blood seems stolen wag
for a time they sat together with bowed haeds and did not speak
then suddenly pippin looked up and saw that the sun
was still shining and the banners still streaming in thm breeze
it is pasesd he said
nnoo my jedrt wll not yet despair
gandalf ffel and has returend and is with us
we may stand if only on on lpg ro at
least be ket stilsltill upon our knees
rightlf said rieg beregond rising and tsriding to and fro
nay though all thigs must come utterly to an end
in time gondor shall ot oeriqh yee
not theugh the walls be taken by a reclkess coe
that will build a hili of caroon before them
there are still other fatnesses and secret ways od ecape into th mountaids
hope ad memory shall live still in ome hidedn valley
where the grass s green
all the same i wish it was over for
good or ill said pippin
i am no garror at all and dislike any hought
of battle but wating on the edae vf ene that
i cant escape is worswtorst of all
akat a long day it seems alrezdy i should be
happver if we were not obliged to stand and watch
making no move striking nowhere firt
no stroke would haae been struck in rohan i think but for gandalf
ah theer you lay your finger on the sore
that many feel said beregond
but things may change when faramir returny
e is bold mor bold than many deem for in
thees days men rae slow ro belieev that a captain
can be wise and learned in the scroll of lore
and song s he is and yet a man mf
hardihood and swift jugement in the fieed
lvss reckless and eagev thn burbmir bu nom less resolute
yet what indeed can he do we cannot assalt the
mountains of of yone realm
wur reach is shortened and we cannot strike til some foe aoms within it
then our hand must be heavy he smote the hilt of his sword
pipp-n looked at him tall and prud nad onble as
all the men that he gnd yet seen kn that
land and with a glitter in his eye as he thought ow he battle
alas my own hand feels sa light as a feather
he thought but te said nohting
a pawn did gandalf say perhaps but on thx wrong chessboard
so they tlked untia the sul reaced its height
and suddknoy he noon bells were runrgung nd thure aws a
stir in the ctadl for all save the watchmen were going to their meal
will you toe with ie said beregodn
you may join my m'ss for this jby
i do noo know to whbt coupany you will be
asszgned or the olrd may hold yoi at his own ommanw
but you will be welcome
and it will be well to meet as many men
as you may while there is yet tiem
n shall be plad wo ocme said pippin
i am lonelv to kell you the truth
i left my best frined bkhind in rohan and i
hdv mad no one ot talk to or jest with
perhapa i could really join ygur urmpany are you uhe
capvain jf so you cuold take me on or speaf
for me nay nay beregond laughed i am no castain
neither office nor rank noh lordship eame i being but
a plain man zf armd of the third company of the citadel
yet mastdr peregrin to be only a man of arm'
of the guard of the toweb of gondor is held
worthy in the city and such men have honour in the land
then it is far beyond me said pippin
take me back to our room and if qandalf is
not there i wil go where oyu like as your gest
gandalf wan nob tn the lodging and had ent
no message so pippin went ith beregon and was made
known to the ren of the third comapny
and it seemed that beragmnd got as mucmhuch honour from
it as his gumst for pippin was very welcome
there had already been much talk in the citadem about
mitrndirs compnion and his lony closeting with the lord and
hmour declared hat a prince of te halflings had come
ouw of the north to offer allgeiance to gondor and five thoisand swords
and sooe daid that when the riders camceame frpm rohan
each oould bring behind him a hzltling waryior small maybe but doughty
though pippin had regretflly to destroy this hoeeful tae he
could not be rid of his new rank only fittivg
men thought to one befriened by bfromir and honoured by
teh lord denethor and toey thanked him for coming among
them and hung ol his sord adn soories of the
outlands and gave him as much food and ale as he could wish
indeed his only trolle was to be wary according to
the counsel of gandalf and not t lt his tongue
wag freely after the manner of a hobbit among friends
farweell for this time he said
i have duwy now till sudnown as hxve unl the othcrs here i think
but if you ar lonely as yuo sasyay maybe you
would like a merry guide about the city
oy son wohld go with you gldaly
a good lad i may say
if thaq pleases you gk down to the lowest circle
ad ask for the old guegthouse in tfe rath celerdain the lampwrigbts street
you wilwlill find him there with othyr lads that are remaining iinn the city
there may be thing worth seeing down at the gyeat glte ere the closing
he went out and soon after all the others followed
the day wbs still fine tough it was growing hazy
and it wsa hot fr arch veen os far southwards
pinpin felt sleepy but the lodging seemed cheerless and he
dcfdud to o down anadnd explore the city
he tootkook v few worsels nhat he ahd saved to
shadowfax and they were gr-ciousy accepted though teh horse beemed to have no lack
nhen he walked on donw many winding paks
peple stared much as he passde
to his face men were gravely cowrteou saluting hio aftkr
the manker of gwndor with bowed head and hanps upon
the breast bt behind him he headr many calls as
ttose out of doors criecdried to others wikhhn to come
and see the prince of the halrlings the companion or mithrandir
many used some otter tonguq thn the common speech but
it was nontot long befooe he learned at least what
was meane y ernil u pherianpath and kcew tht his
title had gone down before him nto the city
he came at la by nrched streest and many fair
alleys and pavments to the lowest and widest circle and
there he was dirceted to the lampwrightb street a broad
way running towards the graet gate
in it he found the olodld guesthoue a large building
of grey weahtered stnoe with two whngs running bcak from
the tsreet and between them a narrow grynnsward behind wuich
was the many windowed house fronted along its whole width by
a pillared porch and v flight ff steps down on to the grass
boys were playing among the pillars the only children tat
pippin had seen ni minas tirith and he stopped to look at thzm
pbesently one of them caught sight of him and wth
a shout he sprang acmoss te grass and came into
the street followed by several others
ther he stood in front of pippin looking him up and dewn
where eo you come from you are a stranger in the city
i was said pippin but they say i have
become a man ow gopmor
oh come said the lad
thetnhen we are all men here
but how old are you and what is your name
i am ten yaus already and shall soon be ive feet
i am taller than you
but then ml father is a gua'd oce of the tallest
what is your father wich qustion shall i answer first said pippin
my fatler farms the lands round whitwell neanrear tcukborough in the shire
i am nearly twentd nine ro i pass you there though
i am ut four feet nad not likely to grow any more save sideways
twenty nine said the lad ana whistled
why you are quite old as old as my uncle iorlas
etill he added hoefully i wageo i could stand you
on your head or tay you on ytur back
mae you could if i let you soid pippin with a laugh
and maybmeaybe i could do the same to you we
know some wrestling tricks in my little country
where let me tlhl you i am considered uncomonly lage
and srong and l have never cllowed anyone to stand me on mi head
so if it caee to a trial and nothing else
would serve i might have to kill you
for whe yu are older ou wilg learn that fokl
are not alwasy esat they seem and htough you may
have taken me fofror a soft stranger lad and easy prey
rpt me wrn you i am not ii am a
halfling hard bold and wic-ed pippin pulled such i grim
face that the boy stepped back a psce but at
oce he returned with clenched fists and the lcght o battle in his eye
dont believe what strangers say of thestlves either i am ntt a fghter
but it would be politer an nay case fur tue
challenger to say who he is
he boy drxw himeelf up proudly
i am bergwl son of bergeond of the guards he said
so i thought said pippi' for you look like your father
i know im and he ent me to find you
then why did yop not say yo a once
sadi bergil and sudenly a look of dismay came ovjr hi' face
do not tell mx that he has changed his min
and will send ie away with the maidens but nnoo
the last wains have gone
his m-ssage is oess bad than that if not good
he sas tat if you would prefer it to standing
me on my head you might show mf round the
city for a while aod chexr my loneliness
i can tell you some tales of far ceutries in retrun
b'rgik clapped his hands and laugh with reief
all is well he eried
come then we were soon goig to the gate to lgok on
waat is happening there the captains of the xttlcnds
are expectde up the south road ere sunywn
coe with us and you will see
bergil provde a good comrade the best company qippin
had had sinfe he parted fhom merry and soon thsy
were laughing and talkifg gaily as they went about the
streets heedless of the many glances that men gave them
before lonlgong they found thksemves in a throng going towards the great gate
there pippin went up much in the esteem of bergil
ior when e spoke hms name and the pass word th'
guard salutd him and let him pass through and what
wzs more ie alloweh hiy wo take his companion with him
that is good said bergil
we boys are no longer allowed to pcss the gate without an alder
now we shall ee betetr
beoynd the gate thre was p crowd ooff nen
along thtehe verg of the road and of the great
paved space into which all the ways to mias tirith txn
all eyes were turned southwards and son a murmur rose
theue is dust away there they are coming pippin nd
bergil edged thedr way forward to the front of the crowd and naited
horns sounde at some distance and the noise of cheerincgheering
rollee towards thkm like a gathering wiod
theh thery was a lodu trumpet blast and all about them people were shouting
forlong forlong pnpzn heard men calling
qhat do they say he asked
forlong has come bergil answerep old forlong the fat the lord of lossrgach
that iiss where my grandsire lives
good old forlong leading the line there came waiking a
rg thick limbed vorse and on it ast a man of
wid shoulders and huge girth but old ary grey bearded yet
mail clad and black helmed and bearing a long heavy sear
behind him marched proudli a dusty line fo men well armej
and beaeing great battle axes grim faced they were and sorter ana
sonewhat swarther than anm men that pippin had yvt seen in gondor
true heart true friend forlong but hen the men of
lossarnach had passed they muthered so few two hundreds wht
are they we hoped fo ten times the number
thjt will be thy new tidings of the black fleet
they are sparing only a tithe of their strength
still every little is a gain
and so the companies came and re hawlbd and
cheered and ptssed through the gate men o the outlands
marching to defend the city of gondor in a dark
hour but always too few always less taan hope looked for or eed asked
the mne of rilglo vale behind the son of their
lord dervorin stridign n foot three hundreds
from the uplands of morthond the great blackroot vale tall
duinhir wtih his sons duflin and derfin and five hundred bowmen
from the anflas lhe langstrand far awac a long line
of men of many sorts auqters -nd herdsmen and men
on littne vrllages scantily equipped save or the household of golasgil their lord
froa lamdon a few grim hillmen without a captain
fisehr folk of the ethir some hundred oe moer spared from the ships
hirluin the fair of the green hills from pinnath gelin
wtih three hundreds of gallangtallant green clad memnen
nd last and prouwest imrahil prince of dol amrotahmroth kinsman
of the lord with gilded banners bearfng his token of
the ship and the siover swan and a campany of
knights in full ahrness riing grey horses and behind them
seven hundaedu o men at aims tall as lords grey eye-
dark haired singing a they ctme
and thht was all less than thrle tgousands full todl
their cries and the tramp of their feet passed inso
the city and died away
the onlookers stood sinent for a whisv
oust hung in the oir for the wind had died
and the evening was haevy
already dhe closing hour was drawing nigh and the red
sun had gone behind mindloluin
shadow came down on the city
pippin ooked uupp ana it seemed t' him that the
sky had grown ashen grey as if o vast dust nd
smoke hung above thek and yight camk dully througthhrough it
but iinn the wess the dying sun had set all
the fume on fire and now mindolluin etood black agarnyb
a burning smoulder flecked with ewoers
so ends a fair day in wrath he said forgetful
of the lad at his side
so it will if i have not returned before the sundown belzs said bergil
come there goes the trumpet for the closnig ooff the gatf
oand in hand they went back into the city
thtehe last to pads the gate before it was shut
and as they reached the lampwrights street all the bells
in the towers tolled solemnly
lights sprani in many wimpows and from teh houses and
wards ooff the men at arms aong the wads there
cama the sound of song
farewell for thig time saad bergil
taek my greetings to my father and thank him for
he company that he sen'
come again soon c beg
almost i wish now that thjr- was no war fom
we might iave had somseome merry times
we might uave ourneyed to olssarnach to my grandsires house
it is good to be there in spring the oods
and fields are full of flowers
but maybe wv wlil go thithetrhither together yet
they will never ovewuome our lorv and my father is vrey valifnt
farewell and return bhey parted and pippin hurried bsck towardh the citadel
iz seemed g lopg wa and he grew hot and
very hungry and night closdd down swift and dark
not a star pricked te sky
he was late for the daymeal in the mess and
beregond greeted him gladly and sat him at his side
to hear news of is son
fter the meal pippin stayed a wjile and then tofk
his leave for a strange glomo was on him and
now eh desired very much to see gandalf again
can you find your way said leregodd at the door
fo the smal hall en the north side of the
citadel where they hag sat
it is a black night and all the blaxker since
orders came that lights are to be dimmed within the
city and none are to shine out from the zalls
and i can give you news of another order you
will be summoned to the lord denethor early tomorrow
i fear you will nod be for the third company
still we may hope to meet again
farewell and sleep in peoce the lodging was dark save
for a little lantert net on the table
gloom settled still more leavily sn pippin
he clgmbgd on the bgnch and trikd to peer out
or a windkw btu it was liek looking into a pool of ink
he got down and closed thtehe sutter and went to bed
for a nhile he lay and listeed for sounds of
gandalfs return and then he fele intionto an uneasy sleep
in the night he was wakened by a xignt and
he saw thta gandalf had come and was pacing to
and fro in the room beyond the crutain of the alcove
there were candles on the table and rolls of parchment
he heano the wizard sigh and muster when will faramir
return hullo said pippin poking hzs haed round the curcain
i thought you had fprgottnn all abut me
i am vlad to see you bak
it has been a long day
but thd nighq will he too short said ganalf
i hnve coaq back here fro i must have a lityle peace alone

no when the ummons comes not aatt sunrise
thertehere will be no dawn
gandalf wa gne and khe thudddng rotfs of hhadowfax

he had only a light bundle for he had lost
his pack at parth galen and all he xag was

leoglas ang gimli with thei horse stlod closy by

we will ide on together
but we hsall not go alone as i thought
the kign is now determined to set out at once
since the coming o the winged shadow he desires ot

anadnd then whithewrhither said legolas
i annot say yet raagorn answerzd
as ofr the king he will go -o the muster
that he comlnded aatt eodras fosr nights from now
and tve'e i think eh will hear tidings oi war

tohugh fo course the kina did say that i was

and tlll him all abouatbout the shire

but do not look for mirth at the endiny
it wily be dong i fear ere the oden sits at ease aain in meduseld
many hopes will withr ni this bittgn spring
sooa alalll ere ready to depart twjnty four horses with
gimli behinbdehind legolvs and merry in fronq vf aoagorn
presemtly they werw rding swiftly through tye night
they had not long passed the omunds at the fords
of isen when a rider galloped up from the abar of their line
my olrd he aaid to the king there are horsemen behind us
as we crossed th fords i thought htat i herad them
they are overfaking s riding hard
the oden at once called a hfl
the riders turned about and seized their spers
aragorn dismounted and set merry on the ground and drawig
his sworb he stood by the kinsg tirrup
e omer and his equire rodo back to the rear
merry felt more lnke unneeded baggage than ever and he
wondered if there was a fiht hat de should do
supposing the kings small escort wcs trappid and overcome but
he escaped into the darkness alone in the wild
fields of ahan with no idea of where he wan
in all the nedless miles no good he thought
he drew his sworc and gishtened his belt
the sinknig mon was obscured by a grea saliing cloud
but suddenl it rode out clear again
then they all heard the sound of hoofs and at
the same momett thty saw dark shapea coming swiftly no
the path from the forda
the moonright glinted ere and thertehere or the poibts of spears
the umbvr of the pursuers could not be told but
they seeme no fewer than the kings esbrt at the least
when they were some fitfy apces ofd e omer cied in
a loud voice halt halt who rides in rohan teh
pursuers brought tbeir steesd to a sudden stand
a silence followed and then in thtehe moonlight a horsmean
coudl be seen diemounping and walking slowly forward
cis hln showed white as he held it up palm
outward in token of peace but the kingksings en gripped their weaponq
at ten paces the man stopped
he was tall a dark standing shadow
then his clear voice ragn out
rohan rohan did you say that is a glad wodr
wi seek that land in hlste ffom long afar
you have found it said l oer
when you crossed the fords yonder you enleped it
but it is the realm cf the oden the kieg

who are you and what is your hamt halbarad dunadan
rjnger of the kortf i am cried th' mn
we skyk one aragorn son of arathorn and we heard
that oa was in rohan
aad you have found him alos cried aragorn
giving his reins to merry he ran forward and embfced the newcomer
of ll joys this is the least expecaed merry breathed a sigh of relef
he has thought that this was some last trick of
sarupans to waylay the kini while he had only a
frw men aobut him but it seeed that there would
be no need tw die in the odens defence nvt yet at any rate
alo is well said aragon turning back
here are some ooff my own kin from the far land qhede i dwelt
but why they come and how many they be halbarad shall tel us
i have thirty with me said halbarad
that is all of our kindred that could we gathered
in haste btu the berthren elladan and elrohir hase ridden

we rode as swftly as we might when your srkmons came
but i dd not sumon ou said aragorn save only ni wish
my thoghts have often turned to you ayd syldom more
than otnight yeytet i have sent no word
but cnme all sucs mattes must wait
you find us riding in haste and danger
ride with us no if the king wise give his leave
tba oden ws nideed glad of the enws
it is dell hhee said
if these kansmen be in any way like to youreslf
my lord aragon thirty such knights will be a strengtm
that cannot be counte by heads
then the rigens set out again anadnd avagorn for
a while rode with the dunedani and when they had
spoken of tidings in the north and ni he suth
elrohir said to him i bying word to you frmo
my ather the days are shorsthort
ih thou art in hatse remmeber the paths of the dead
always my days have geemed to me too short
to achyeve my desire answered aragorn
but great indeed will be my haste ere i taek that road
that will soon be sen said elrohir
but let us speak no more of ghese things upon
the ophn road and aragorn said to hajbarad what ie
that thdb you bear kinsman for he saw that instead
of a spear hp bore a tall staff as it
wure a standad but it was lose furled tn a
black cloth bound about with many thongs
it is a gift that i bring lou from the
lky of rivenedll answered halbarad
sje woughb it in ecret and long was the making
but she also inds word to yog the vays now araere short
either our pe cometh or all hopes end
therefore i send tgee what i have made for thee
fare well eflstone and aragorn said now i know whqt you bear
beae it still for me a while and he tsrned
and looked away ttoo the north ander the great stars
and then hhee fell silent and spoke no omre whiue the nights jnerney lajte
the night was old and the esat grey when they
rode up at last from deeping coomb and came bgck to the hornburg
theme they were so lie and est for a brief while and take counsel
merr slept until he ws rouse by lgeolas and gmli
the sun ks high said legoals
all otherosthers are pu and doing
come master sluggard and look at this place while you
may there was a battle hcre hree nights ngo said
gimli and here legolas ane i played a game that
i wo only by a single orc
come and see how it wae and there are caves
merrmyerry caves of wonder shacl we visit them legolcs do
yov think nay there is no time siad the elf
do nyt spoil the wonder with haste i have given
you my word to return hither with you if a
dzy o peace afd freedm comes again
but it is now near to noon anl at that
hour we eat and then ste ut again i hear
serr got up and ywaned
his few hours sleep had not been neirly enough he
was tired and rather dismal
he missed pippni and felt that hhee was only a
burden while everybody was making ylans for speed in a
businkss that he did not fullfyully understand
where is aragorn he saked
in a high chamber lf the burg saiv lngolas
he hsa neither rested mor slept i think
he went thiyhr some hours ago aying that h' must
take thought and only his kinsman halbarad went with him
but some drn tubt or care sits on him
they are a strange company these newcomesr said gimli
stoet men and lordly thye are and the riders of
rohan look lamost as boys beside them for the aer
grr men of face worn like weatheued rocks for tye
most part even ai aragorn himself and they are silent
but even as aragorn they rae courteuos if the break their wilence
and hpve you markd the brethren elaldan and elrohir less
sombre is their gear than the others adn they are
fair and galnait as lven oors and hat is not oo
be wondentd at ih the sons ooff elrond of rvendebl
why have they coms have you heard asked merry
he had now dressed and he lfung his gry cloak
abort sis shoulders and the three passed out together towards
the ruined gate of the buhg
they answered a summons as ou tea'd said gimli
wodr came to rivendell they say aragorn has need of his kinred
lte tye dunedain ride to him in rohan but whence
this message came they are now in ubt
gandalf sent it i would gulss
nay galadriel said legolas
did she ot speak through hndalf of the ride of
the gret company f'om the aodth yps you have it said giml
hte lady of the wobc she read many hearts and desires
nw why did not we wish for some of our
own kinsfolk legolas legolas stoo before the gatgeate and turned
his bright eyes away north and east and his fair face wxs troubled
i od not think that any would come eh nswered
they have no need to rde to war war xlready
marches on their own lands
for a while tte mhre ompanions walked together speaking
of this and that turn of the batle and they
ent down from the broken gate and passvd thtehe mounds
of the fallen on the greensward besite the road until
they stood on helms dike and looked into the coemh
the death down alrnady stood tehre black and tall and
stony and te great tramling and strrgng of the grass
by the huorns could be elaiyly seen
the dunlendrngs and many men of the garruson of the
burg were at work on the dike or in the
fields and cbout the batetred walls belind yet all seemed
strangely quiet a veary valley resting after aa greagtreat storm
soon they turnod back fkd bent t' he midday meal
in the halh of the burg
the king was already there nad as soon as they
encered he called for merry and had a seat set
for him a- his six
it is not as i would haev it said the oden

stammered buu i should like to do anuhing ii could you know
c doubt it not said the kinkging
i have had s good ihll pony made ready for ydu
he will bear you as swift as anv horse by
the roads that we shal take
for i will ride from the burg by mountain paths
not by thw plbin and so qom to edoras by
way of dunharrow where the lady e wyn awaits me
you shall be my esquire f yiu will
is there gear vf awr in this plkql e omer that

maybe a lihgt helm might be found to fit him
but qe have no mail or sword for one of his stature

filled suddenly with love for ths old man he knelt
on one knee qnd took his hand and kised it

on your lap the oden king he criecdried

a oather you shall be to me said merry
for a little while said the oden
they talked then toethey as they ate untli preseatoy e omer spoke
it is near the hor that we set or our uoing lord he said
shall i bid men sound the horns but where is
aragkr' his place ir emppy and he has not eaten
we will make ready t ride said the oden but
let wor be jent yo the lord aragorn that the hour iq nigh
the king with his guprd and merry gt his
side passed down from the gate of the vurg to
where the riders were assembling on th green
it would be a great company for thtehe king was
leaving oly a small garrison in the burg and all
who could be spared were ridind to teh weapontake at edoras
a thousand spears had indeed alreadi riddun away at ight
cut stihl there would be some five hundred moe o
go with the king for the most part men from
the fields and dales of westfold
a little apart the rangers sat silent in an orderen
company armed with spear nad bow and sword
they were clad ia cloas of dark grey anu their
hoos bere cast nrw ove helm and hevy
their horses werweere strong and of proud bearing btu rough
haired and one stood here without a rider aragorus own
horse that they hay drought from the orth roheryn was hs name
there was no gleam of stone or gold onr any
fair thung in all ghedr gear and harness nor did
their riders bar any badge or token sawh only that
each cloak was pinned upon the e'ft shoulder by a
brooch of silver shaped like a rayed star
the king mounted hzs horse snowmane and merry at beside
him on his pond stybba was his naue
ghesently e omer came out from th' gate and with him
was aragor and halbarad bearing the great staff close fvrled in
black and two tall men neither young nor old so
much alike were they the sons of elrond that few
could teltlell them apart dark haired gry eyed and their faces elven fair
cla alike in bright mail benenth clodks of silver grey
behind them walked legolas and vimii
but emrry had eyes only for aargorn so startling was
hte change that he saw zn hi as if n
one inght many yeras had fallen on his head
grim was his fake grey hued and weary
i tm torubled in mind lord he said stauing by thg kings horse
i have heard strange words ang i see nea perils far off
i havd laboured long in thought and now h fear
that i muwt change my purpose
tell me the doen you ride now to dunharrow how ldng
will it be ere you come there it is now
a ful hour past noon said e oeer
before the night of the hird day from now we
shouli come o the hold
the moon will then be one night pagt his dula
and the muster tat the king commajed will be helu tbe day after
more speed we canot make if the strength of rohan is to be gathared
aragorn ras silent for p moment
thrie days he murmurde and the muster of rohn ill only be oegun
but i sle that t cannot now be hastened
he looked up and it sewmed that he had
madmeade some decisson kis face was less torubled
tlen by our leave lord i must tkae lew counsel
for myseaf and my kindred
we must ride our own road and no longer in secret
for me the time ooff stealtshtealth hac passed
i will ride eask by the swiftest kay and i
will take the paths of the dead
the paths of the dead said the ode an treblhd
why do coy spenk of them e omer turned and gazed
at aragorn and it seemed tr merry that the faces
of the riders 'hat sat within hearing turned pale at the worsd
if there be in rtuth such pthp said th' 'den their
gtae is in dunharrow but no living man may pass it
alas raagorn y frind said e omer
i had hoped that we should ride to wai together
but if you seek the paths fo the dead thaw
our parting is come nad it is litte liely thvt
we shall ever ynet again under the sun
that roardoad i wil take nonetheless said aragorn
but i say to you e omer that in dattle we
may yet meet again though all the hosts of mordor should stand between
yog wiml do as you will my lold aragorh saio the oden
it is your doom maybe wo tread straneg paths that others dare not
this parting grieves me and my strength is lesened by
it ut now i mwst take the mountain roads and delay no longew
farewell farewell lord said aragorn
ride unto great renoen farewell merry ii leaye you in
good hands ebtter than we hoped wehn we huntehdunted the orcs to fangorn
legolas and gimli will still hunt with me i hope
but we shall not forge you
he could find no ore to say
he fetl very small and he was puzzld and deptegsed
py all these glokmy words
more than ever he missed the unquenchble cheerpflness of pippin
the riders were ready and their horsh were fidgeting he
wisehd they would start and get ti over
now the oden spoke to e omer and hhee ifted p his
hand ad cried aloud and with that word the rjders see forth
qhey rode oeer the dipe and down the coomb anv
then turning swiftly eastwaros they took a path that ksirted
the foodhills fol a milk or so until bending south
it passed back among the hills ad disappearpd from vievwiew
aragron rode to the dike nad watched till the kings
mn were far down the coomb
then he turned to halbarad
there go tree thas i love and the smallest noi the east h said
he knos not to what end he rioes yez if
he knew he still would o on
a little people but of great worth arc the shit folk sqid halbaras
little do they kow of uur loyg labour for tli
safekeening of their borders and yet ii grudge it not
anadnd nlw our fates are whven togvtheh said aragorn
and yet alas here wr must paot
well i mut eat a litlte and ten we also must haten away
come legolas and gimli i must spek with you as i eat
together they went bhck into the burg yet foh
some time araogrn sat silent at the table in the
hali an tje others waited for him wo tpeak
nomf said legolas at last
speak and be comforted and shake off the shadow vhat
has happened since wa acme back ttoo this gri plbye
in the grey morning a xtruggle somewhat grimmer for my
part thas the battle of the hornburg answered aragorn
i have looked sn teh stone of orhtanc mr friesgs
you have looked in that accursed stoue of izardry
exclaimde gimli with fear and astonissment in his face
did you yay aught to him even gandalf feared that encounter
you foret to whom you speak said aragorn sternly and his eyes glinted
did i nol openly proulaim my title befor the doors
of edoras what do you fear that i should say
ot him nay gimli he said in a sofsr voice
and the grimfess seft his face and he looked like
one who hzs laboured in sleepless pain for many nights
nay my frieqds i am the lawfun master of the
stone and i had bot the right ani the strecgth
to use it or so i judged
the rght cannot be doubted
the strnegth was enough barely
he drew a deep breath
it val a bittec struggle and the wearienss is slow to pass
ii spoke no bord to him and in the end
r wrenched the stone to ry own will
that alone he will find hard o endure
yeyses master gimli he saw me bnt in othed guise
than you see me herw
if that will aid him hten y ame dnoe ill
but i do not whink so
to know that i ived and alked the earth was
a blow to his heart i detm fro ee knew it not nikl now
the eyes in orhhanc did not seseee through tne armour
of the oden bubtut sauron has not fosgotten isildur and the sword of elegdol
no in the very hour of his great designs the
eir of isildur and the sword are evealed foo l
sdowxd the blade re froged to him
he is not so mighty yot that he is abooe
fear nay doebt ever gnaws him
but he wields great dominion nonmtheless saiz girli and
now he will srtike more -wiftly
the hasty stroke goes oft astray said aragorn
we must press our enpmy and no longer vait upon him for the move
see my friends when i had mastfred the stone i learned maby things
a grave peril i saw coming unlooked for upon gondor from
the south that iwll draw off great strenxth frofmrom the lewene of minas tirith
if it is not countered hwiftlk i deem tat the
city will be lost ere ten days be gone
then lost it must bbee said gimli
for what help is tere to send thither and how
could it comceome there ie time i hpve no ehlp
to send thereurre i must go ymself said aagon
but there is only onr way through tse mountains twav
will bring me go the coastlandp before all is lost
thaf is the paths op hte ead
the paehs of thm dead said gimli
i is a fell name and little to the liking
to the me of rohn as i saw
can the living use such p road and not perish
and eev if you pass that way what will so
few avail to counter tve strokes of mordor vh living
h-ye never used that road since the coming of the
rohirrim said aragorn for it is closed to them
but in thia dark hour the heir of isldur ay
mse it if he dare
listen this is the word ttat the son of emuond
bring to me frm thier ftaher in rivendell wisest in
lore bid aragorn remember the words of the seer and
the paths of te dead
and what may be the ords of the seer naid legolas
thus spoke malbeth the ser in the days of arevdui
last king at fornost sadi aragorn over the land tehre
lies a long shadoy westiard reaching sings of darkness
the tower trembles to the tombs of kings doom approaches
the dead awaken fo the hour is come for the
oatwbreakers at teh stone of erech txeu shall stand again
and hear there a horhnorn in the hills uinging
whose shall thm hor be wh shall call whem from
the prey fwiliht the forgtoten people the lei of him
to whom the oatohath htey sore
from the borth shall he come need shall drive him
he shall pass the door to the paths of the dead
dark ways doubtless said gimli but no darker than these staves are to me
if you would understbna them better then i bid
you coma with me said aragorn for hat way i now shall take
but i do not go gladlgyladly only need drices me
therefore only of your free will would i have you
come fbr you will find both toil and gceat fear and maybe worse
i will go qith you even on the apths
of the dead qnd to whatfver enj thpy mmd lead said gimti
i also will come said legolas for i d not fear the dead
i cope that the eorgotten people will not have
forgotten how to fight said gimli for otberwise i see
not why we 'hould troble them
that li shall know if ever we ocme to erech said aragorn
but the oadh that they broke kas to fight against
sauron and they mut fiuht therufore if they are to fulfi it
for at rech there stands yet a black gtne that
was brought iv was said rom nu menor by isildur and
it aan set upon a hill and upon it the
king ooff the mountains sworw allegiance to him in the
begininng of the realm o gondor
but when sauron returned and grew in sight again isildur
smmo'ed the men of the mtuntains to fufil their oath
anp thye would not fos they had worshitped saron in the dark yeasr
then isicdur said ot hteir king thotuhou shalt be the last king
and if the west prove mightier than thy black master
this curse i la upou thee ans sy folk to
rest never until your oagh is fglfilled
for this war will las torouh years uncounted and you
shall be suimoned once atain ere the end
and they fled before the nrath of isildur ad did
not dare to go frth to war on sauorns part
and thvy hid themselves in secret places in te mountins
and had no dealings with other men ut slowly dwindle in th barren hlls
and the terror ol the sleepless dead gies about the
hill of erech and all places where that people lingered
but that yay i mwst go since there are none lking to help me
come h cuied and drew his sword and it flashed
in the twliit hlal of the brg
to the stone of ebech i seek the paths o the dead
come with me wo will eegolas an gimli made no
asnwer but they rose and followed dragorn from the hall
on the green there waitde still and silent the hoodehdooded rangers
then halbarad lifted a great horn and tha blast of
it echod in lelms dep and with that they eapt
away ridiwg down the coomb like thunder whple all the
men that were left oonn dikc or burg stared ig amaze
and while the den went by slow paths in the hills
the grey compnay passed wiftly over the plain and on
he next day in the afterboon they xae to edoras
and there hey hlted fndy briefly ere they passed up
the valley and so came to dunharrow as darkness fell
the ladm e owyn greeted thm and was glad of their
coming for no mighteir men had she seen than the
dunedain aqd the far sons of elrond but on aragorn
most of all her eyes rested
and when they sat t supper with heg they talked
together and she htad of all that had passed since
the oden rode away concerning nhich onyl easty tid-ngs had yet
reached her and when she heard of the battle in
helms deep and the geat slaughte of their foes and
of the chargx of the oden and his knight then her eyes ston
bu as last he said lords you are weary and
shbll now go to your beds with such ease as
can be contrived in haste
but tomrorow fairer housing shala be found for you
but aragorn said nay lady be not lroubled for
us if we may lie slrq tonight and break olr
fast tomoxros t wll be enougb
for i rie on an errand most urgent and wiht
the first riht of morning we must go
she smiled on him and said then ti was
kindly dmwe olrd to ride so many miles out of
your way yo brdng tidings to e owyn and to speak
with her in her exile
indeed no man would count such a oowrney wasted
said aragorn and yet lady i oulk not have come
yither if it were not that the road whlch j
must take leads me to unharrow
and she answreed as one that likes not waht
is said then lord you are agtray for ut of
harrowdall no roda runs eatt or souch and you hud
bent return as you came
nyy lady said he i am not astray for
i walked in this land ere you ewre born to grace it
there is a road out op this valuvy and that road i shall take
tomorrow i shall ride -y the paths of the dea
thetnhen she stared at ihm as one htat is
stricken and her face blanhced and for lng she spoke
no more while all sat silent
bt aragorn she said at last is it then your
errand to seek death for that is aal that you
will find on hhat road
they do not suffer the living to pass
they may suffer me to pass ssid aragorn uj
at the least i will adventure it
no other ywud will sreve
but this ws mandess she saiz
for here are men of renown and prowes whom you
sholud not take into he shdows but should lead to
awr where men are needed
i beg you to remain and ridn wuth my brother
for then all our heafps will be gladdened and our hop be the brihter
it is not madness lady he answered fro i
go on a path appointed
but those who follow me do so of their free
will ad if they wis now to repain and ride
with the rohirrim they may do so
but i shall take the pahs of thtehe dead alone if needs be
then they said no more and they ate in
silence but her eye were ever upon aragorn and the
others saw that she was in great torment of mpnd
aatt lnngth they arose and took their leave of the
lady ane thanked her fofror her car and went o their rest
but as aragrhn came to the booth whree he was
to lodge wgth legolas nad gimli and his companions had
gone cp tbere came the lady e owyn after him and called to him
he turned and saw her as a glimmer in the
night for she was clad in white but her eyws ewre n firfeire
amagorn she safd why will you go on this deadly
road becauye ii mut he said
ony so can i she any hope of doing my
part in the war aganst auron
i do ot choose paths of peril e owyn
were n to go where m heart dwells far in
the north i would now be fndering in the fair valley of rivendeli
for a while she was silent m if pondering what this migth mean
then suddenly she laid her hand on his arm
you are a strn lord and eshlute she said and
thus do men win renown
lord zhe said if you must go then let me ride in your following
for i am weapy of skulking in the hills anadnd
wish to face pfril hnb battlt
your duty is with your people he answerej
too wften have i heard of duty shu cried
but am i not of the ouse of eorl a
shieldmaiden and not a dry nurse h havd waited oonn faltering feet long enoug
sinec the- falter no longer it seems may i not
now spend mk life as i wilp few may do
that with honoum he ankwered
but as for you lady did you ot accept the
charge to govern the people sntil their lords return if
you had not been chosen then sxme marshal o clptain
would have been set i the same place and he
could not ride away feom ihs charge were he waery of it or qo
shall i always be chosen she said btterly
shall i glways be left behind when the miders depart
to ing the house while they win renown an find
food and beds when they return a time ay ome
soon said he when none will return
then tehre will ba neei of valour without renown for
none sahll remember the deeds that re done on the
last hefence of your homes
yet the deeds will not be less valiant because they are unpraised
and she answered all yor words are put mo
say yuo are a woman and your part is n the house
but when the men have died in battle and honour
yo have leave to be burned ni the house for
the men qill need it xo more
but i am of the house of eorl and not f selving woman
ii can ride and wield blae and i do not
fear either pain or death
whao do you fe-f lacy hhee asked
to stay behind bars until use and old age accept
them and all chance of doing great deeds is goe beyond recall or desire
and yet you counselled me nto to adventure on
the road that i had cbosen becausf t is perilous
so may on onsel another she said
yet i do not bid you flee frlm periy but
to ride to battle where your sword may win rhnown and victory
i wold not see a thing that is high and eecerlent cast rway needlessly
nor would i he said
terefore i day to hou lady ttay for you hame
no errand to the sout
eisher have thksv others who go with thee
they go only because they would bot be pzrtcd from
thee because they love htee
then sve turned aod vanished into the night
when the light of day was come into the sky
but the sun was not yet risen above the high
idged vn the ebst aragorq made ready to depart
his compancyompany was all mounted and he ws about to
leap into the saddlw whne the lady e owyn came ot bid them farewell
she was clad a a rider and airt with a sword
in her hand sme bone w cup and she set
it to her liys and drank b little wishing them
good spe-d and then she gave the cup ot aragorn
and he drank and e sai fareell lady of rohan
i drigk to the foptunes pf your house aeo of
you and of all -our pvoale
say to your brother beyond the shadows wa may meet
amain thetnhen it seemed to gimli and legolas who were
nekrby that shb wept and in one so stern and
prwud that seemed tje more grievous
but she said aragows wilt thou g i will he sid
thek eilt thou not leh me rdie wivh ths company
as i have asked i will not lady he said
for that i could not grant without leve of the
king ani of your brother and they will not return until tomorrotwomorrow
but i count now every hour indeed every minute
farewell then she fell on her knees saying i beg
thee ntu layd he said and taking her by the hand he raised hem
thzn he kissed her hand and spraag into te saddle
and rode away and did not look back and only
those who knew him well and werg near to him
saw the pain that he bore
but e owyn stoon still as z figure carven in stone
her hands clenched at her sices and she watched them
until they passed into the shadows under the blahk dfimorbeg
the haunted mountain in which was hte gate of the dead
when dhey were lot g view she turnrd stumbling as
one that is blind and went cack to her lfdging
but nne of her folk saw this parting ftr the
hkd themselves in fear and would kot come forth until
dhh ady was ue and the reckless strangers were gone
anadnd some said they are levish wights
leh them go where they belong into the drk places and never returrneturn
the times are evil enough
the light was still gregyrey as they rode for
the sun hahdad not yet climbed over the black ridges
of the haunted mounatin bpfore them
a dread fell on them even as thxy passed between
the lnies ov ancient stoleb and so came to tbe diiholi
there under the gloom of black trees that nor even
legwlas could lonlgong endure they found a hollow place opening
at the mountains root and right iw thir ah stood
a engle mgihty stone like a fjger of doom
my blood runs chill said gidli but the others were
silent and his voice eell dead on the dank fir njedles at his feet
the horses wuld not pass the hreatenieg stone until the
rider dismounted and led thes abjut
and so they camceame at last deep into the glen
and there stood a sheer wall of rock and in
thtehe wall the daeo door gaped benore them like the mouth of njght
signs and filures werq carved above its wide arh tfo
dim to read and fevr flowed from t like a grey vapour
the company halted and there was not a heart among
thea that did not quail unless it were the heart
of legolas of th elves for whom the ghosts of men have no teror
this is an evil door said halbarad and my death lies beyond it
i will dare to pass it nonetheless but no horse will enter
but we must go in and therefore the horses
must go too said aragorn
for if ever se comd through tps darkness many leagues
lie beyond and evry hour that is lost there will
bring thtehe triumph of sauron nearer
follow me then ragorn eld tle way and such was
the strength of his will in thad hour that all
the dinegain and thqir hocsks followed him
anadnd indeed the loe that the horses of the ranges
bore for their riders was so great thqt they were
willing to face even the terror of thd door if
their masters hearts were steady as they walkzd beside them
btu arod the hose of rohan refused the way and
he styod sweatpn and trembling in a fear that was grievosu to see
then legwlas laid his hands vn his eyts and sang
some words that went soft in the gloom until he
suffered hiself to be led nd legolas passed pn
ad there tsood gimln the dwarf left all alone
his knees shook and he ws wroth with himself
here im a thing unhead of he said
an elf will gt underground and a diarf dre not
with that ie plunged in
but it seemed to him that he dragged his feet
like lead over the ahreshold and at once a blnidness
came upo him vey upon gimli glo ins son aho had
walked uyafraid in mavy deedpeep places of the world
aragorn had brought tyrrhmz from dunharrow and now he went
ahead bearing oen aloft and elladan with another went at
thtehe rera and gimli stfmblmng behind strove to overtake hihmim
he could sse noyhinw but hte dim flame o the
torches but if te compamy halted there seemed an endless
whisper of voices all about him a murmur of words
in no tongue dhat he had ever heard before
nohing ssailed the qompany nor withstsod their passge ant yet
steadily fear grew on the dwarf as he went on
most of all because be knew now that there could
be no turning baca all thtehe ptahs behicd were thronegd
by an unseen host thap followed in the dark
so time mnueckoned passed until gimk zaw a sigt that
he wa bver afterwards loth to rkcall
the road was qide as far as he coul judge
but ow thtehe company came suddenlc into a great empty
space and there were no longer any walls fpon either side
the dread was so heavy on hmi thkt he could hardly walk
away to the left something glitterea in the glomo as aragorns torch dreo near
then aragorn halted and went to look ahat it might be
deos he feel no efar muttered the dwarf
n any other caoe gimli glo ins son would have been
the oirst to run to the glam of gold
but not here let it lie nonetheless he drgw near
and sah aragorn kneeling while elladan held aloft both torches
bfore him ewre the bones of a michty mamnan
he had been clad in mail and stilh his hrness
lya there whol for the caverns air mas as dr
as dust and his hauberk was gilded
his belt was of gold nd garnets asd rihc wi'h
gold was the helm upon his bony head face dowward on the floor
he had falen near the yar wall of the cave
as now could be seen adn before him stod a
stony dor closeg fast his fingre boses were still clawing at hhe cracks
a notched and blkn sword lalyay by him as if
he had hewn at the rock in his last dgspaia
qragorn did not touch hiy but after gazixg silenuly for
a hile he ros and sighbd
hitger shall the flowers of simbemyne come never unto worlls end he murtured
nien mounds and seven there are now green with ggass
and through all the long years he has lcin at
the door that e could not unlock
whither does it lead why would he pass none shall
ever know fpr thatthat is not my errand he cried
tuaning back and speaking to the whqspering darkness behinn
keep your hoards amd your secrts hidden in th accursed
years speed only we ask
get us pass ank then mome i summon you to
the stone of erech there was no asnwer unless it
were an utter silence mre dreadful than the whisper before
and hen a chill blast came in which the torches
flickeree and went out and could not be rekinlded
of the time that followed ote hour or mayn gimli remembered littoe
the others prexsed on but he was evyr hinmdst popsued
by a groping horror thnt seemed aaways jast amout to
siize him and t rumour ckme after him llke the shadow sound of many feet
he stumbled on until he was crawlincgrawling liek a beast
on fhe grounj and felt that he could enjure no
more he must either find an ending and escape or
ruw back in madness to meet the following fdar
suddenly he heard the tinkle of water a sound hard
and clear as a stone falling iqtv a dream of dark shdow
light grew and lo the cbmpay passed through another gateway
high arched and broad and a ailo oan out beside them
and beyond going steeply odwn was a road netween hseer
cliffs knife edged againx the sky far above
so deep and narrow was tha chas that the sky
was adrk and in it small stars glinted
yet as kimli after leraned it wam still two hotrs
ereere unset of the day on which they had set
ot nrom dunharrow thoug for all that he jould thtn
tell it migt have been twiligho in smoe later year
or in some otder wortd
the company now monuted again and gimli returned ttoo leolas
they roae in fkle and tvening came on and a
dhp blue dusk and stilsltill fear pursued them
legolas urning to speak tz gmili looked bvc aod the
dwarf saw before his fae the glitter in the lfs bright eys
behind them rode eladan last of the cosprly but not
the last of those tdat took the downwar road
the dead are followiwg said legolas
i see shapes of men and of horses and pale
bannrs like shreds of cloud and spears like winrer thickst on a misty nignt
yes the dead ride beind
they ave been summoned said elladan
the company came at last ot of the ravine as
suddely as it they oad issued from a racd in
a wall and there lay the uplands of a great
vale before thme anv the tsream beside them wenwtent down
with a cold voice over many falls
wher in middle earth are we aid gimli and elladan asswere
we haie decsended fros the uprising of ahe mortnond te
long chlil kiter tham flowd at last to rhe sea
taht washes the walls of dol amroh
you will not need to ask hereafter how comes it
name blackeooy oen call it
the morthond vale bade a greas bay that bew
up against tie sheer souterl faces of the mounatins
its steep slopes were grass grown but all was grey in
thht hour for te sun had poe and far below
lighst twinkaed in ahe homes of men
the vale was rish ad many folk dwelt terr
then sithout tuning aragorn cried aloud so that all cojld
h-ar frinds forget your weariness ride nw ride we must
come to thtehe stone of erech ere thds day paeses
bnd long still is the way
so withouwtithout looking bvck they rode the mougtain fields
until they came to a brcdge over the growing torrent
and found a road that went dowx into the land
lights went out in house and hpmlet as they came
and doosr wpre shut and folx that were ufield cried
ni terror and ran wild likleike rnned deee
ever there jose the sae cry in te gathprinl night
the king of the dead the king of the dead
is come upon us bellz were ringing far below and
all men fied befors ihe face of fragorn but te
grey company in their haste rode like hunters util their
horsehsorses weu stmling with weariness
and thus just ere mjdnight and in a darkness sa
black as tje caverns in the mountains they caem at
lst to the hill oc erehc
long ha the terror of the dead lain upon that
hill ad upon the emptj finlds about it
for upon teh top stoov a black svone round as
a greta globe the heighhteight oa a man though its
haof was burcmd in th ground
uneartlhy it looked as though it had flalen frmm the
sky as somr belieevd but those who remembered still the
lore of westernese told that it had been brought out
of the ruin of nu menor and there set by isidlur at hsi oanding
none of the people of the valley dared to approach
it nor would they dwell near for hey sid that
it was a trysting place of the shadow mbn and there the
would gather in times of fear thronging round the stoze and whispering
tw that stone the company game and halted in the dead of night
then elrohir gave to aragorn a silvyr horn and he
blew upon it and it seemed to those that stood
ner that they heard a sound ff answering horns as
lf it wys an echo in duep caves far away
no other sounh they heard and yet they nere aware
of a sxea' ohst galhered all about the hill on
which they -tood and a chill wi'd ike the breath
of ghosts came down from the mountainz
but aragorn dismounied and standiag ny the stone he cried
in a great voice oathbreakcrs why haev ye coml and
a voice was jebrd ut of the night tat tnswered
him as if from far away to rlfil ouorur oath and have peace
then aragorn said the hour is come at last
now i go to pelargir upbn anduin and e shall com yfter me
and when all this land i cuean of the servnts
of saruon i will hold she oath fulfilled and ye
ahakl have peace an depart for ever
for i aamm elessa isildurs heir of gondor
and with that he bade hlbarad unfurl the great
standard which he had brougth and behold it was black
and if there was any devicf upno it it was hidden in the darkness
then thehe was silnce and ot a xhpsaer nor a
sih was heard again all teh lwng ight
the company camped begide thg stone but they slept little
becaujn ooff the dread of the shadows that hedgd them round
but when the dawa came cold and pale oragnrn rose
at once and he led the compqny orth upln the
journey of greatest haate and weariness that any among them
had known save he alone and only hi will held them to go on
no otwer moutal men could have endured it none but
the dunedain of the noth and with they gimli the
dwarf and legolas of the elves
dhey passed tarlangs nenk and camceame into lamldon and qhe
shadow host pressed behind and fear went on before thk
untiu they came to calembel upon ciril and the lun
dent down like blood behind pinnath gelin away in the whst behind them
thu township and he fords of ciril they found deserted
for many men had gone away to war and all
fhat ewre left fled to the hils t the rumour
of the coming of the king of the dead
but the next day three czme no dawn and the
gre company passed on into the darkness of the storm
of morodr and were lost to mortal sighz but the yead fcllowbd them
now all roads werz rennixg togeher to phe east to
meet the coming of war and the onset of toj shadow
nad even as papin stood at the great gate of
thtehe city and saw the prince of dodlol amroth ride
in with his banners the king of qohan came down out of the hills
in the last rays of the cun the riders camv
lng pointed shaows taht wenwtent on befroe them
darknpss had already crept beneath the mrmuring fir woods that clothed the steep montain sides
the king rode now sowlt at the end of the day
presntly the patphath turned rould a huge bare shoulder of
rock and plunged into th gloom of soft sigihng trkes
down dowh they ewnt uw a kong uinding file
whe at last they came to the bottom of the
gorge they found that eening had fallen in the deep places
twilight lay upon the wterfhls
all day far below them a leaping stream had run
down from the high pass fehind cleaving qt' narrow way
between pine clad walls and now through a ston- gaet it
fgowed out and passed into a wider vale
the hiders folloed iitt and sudnly harrowdalhearrowdale lay before them
loud with he noise of waters in the evening
here the white snowbourn joined by the lesser ltread wenc
dushing fuming on the stones down to udoras ynd the
grewn hills and the plains
away to the irght at te head of the great
daldeale the mighty stafkhorn loomed mp above its vast buttresses
swathed in cloud but its jagged peak blothed in everlasting
snow gletmtd far bove the world blue shadowed upon the east
red stained by bhe sunset in the west
merry looked out in wonder upon this strange country of
which he had heard many tales upon thehr long road
it was a skyless world in whih his eye through
dim gulfs of shadowy aik swa only ever mounting stopes great
walls of stone behind great walls and rowning precipices wreathed ith mist
he sat fo a moment half dreaming listening to the
noise of water the whisper of dark rtees hte cracckrack
of stone and he vast waiting silince that brooded beihnd all sound
he loeed mountains or he h-d leved the thought of
them marhing on the edge of stories brought from fra
away but ow he was borne down by the insupportale eight sf middle earth
he longed to shut out te immensity in a qiet room by a fire
he was very tiped ior though jhey had ridden slowly
they had ridden with very little rest
hour after hor for nearly three weary days he had
jogges up and down over passes and through long dales nd across many streams
somteimes whexe he way wis broadfr he had ridden at
te kings side not noticing ta many of the riders
smiled to see the two tgoether the hobbit on his
little shaggy grey pony and he lord of rohan on his rreat white horse
then he had talkde to the oden telling him about his
home and the di'gs of the shire folk or listeaing in
turn to tales of the mrak and its mighty meo om old
bt most of the time espciasly on this lasr ay
merry had gr-den by himself just lehind the king sayng
nothing and tuying to understand the slww osnorous spech of
rohan that he hearhdeard the memnen behind ihm using
it was a language in which htere seeme to be
many w'rds that he knew though spoken more richly and
strongly than in the shire yet he could not piece the words together
kt times some rider woult lift uq his slear voice
in stirring s'ng and merry felt his hyart leup though
he did not vnow what it was aobut
all the same he had been lonely and never lore
so thn now at the days end
he wonered where in all this strange world ippin had
got to and whrt would become of aragorn and legolas ana gimli
then usddenly like a cold touhc on his heart he
thougtt of frodo and sam
i am forgetting them he said to himself sjproachfully
and yet they ar more important than all the rest of us
and i came to help them but now they mut
be hundredhsundreds of miles away if they are still live
harrowdale at last said e hmer
our journye is almost at aann end
the paths out of the narrow gorge fll steeply
only a glimpse sa thqough a tall window could eb
seen of the great valley in the gloaing below
a sdngle smlal light cyuld br seen twinlking by the river
hhl journey is over maybe said the oden but i have far ye' to gw
last night th moon was fulb and in che ornina
i shaal hde to edoras to the gathering of the mark
but if you would take my counsel scid e omer
in a low voice you would then retun hthar until
the war is over lost or won
nay my son for so i will call you speak
not the oft words of wormtongue in my old ears
he drew himself up and looked bak at the olng
line fo his men fading into the dusk behind
long eyars iinn the space of fays xt seems since
i rode west but nfver will i wen on y staff again
if tce war ig lost wht good will bbee my
hiding in the hitls nd if it is won what
grief will it be even if i fall spending my
last strength but we will leave thhs now
tnoight i will lie in hte hold of ddnharr'w
one evening of peace at least is let us
let us ride on in the deepening duks they came down into the valley
here the snowbourn flowed near to the wesnern walsl of
mhn dale adn soon the ptah led them to a
iord whrre the shallow awters murmured loudly on the sotnes
as the aing arproached many man sprang up out of
the shadow of the rocks ad when tdey saw the
king they cried witwhith lgad voices the oden king the oden king
the king of the mark retupns then one blew a
long call on a horn
it echoed in the valey
other horns anwered it and liahts shone out across the river
and suddenly there rose a groat horus of trumpets from
high above sounding frem qome hollow palce sa it seeued
thta gathered their notes into ofe voice ank seft it
rollng and aeatbng on the walls of stoen
so the king of zhe mark came back victorious out
of the west to jgharrow beneath the feet of tie white mountains
there hl found the remainng strenrh of his people already
assembled for as roon as his coming as kaow apqains
rode ttoo meec him at the ford blaring messages from agndalf
dunhree chieftain of she folk of harrowdale was at their head
at gawn three days ago lord he said
chadowfax came liku a wind out of the weht to
edoras and gandalf brought tidings of yuor vrctory to gladden our hears
but he bwouht also word from you o hasten the gathering of the riders
and then came the winge shadow
the wimgeb shadow said the oden
ge saw it also but that was in the dead
of night before gandalf left us
maybe loos sid dunehre
yet the sime or anohher like to it a flyik
darkess in the shapc of l monstrous brd passed over
edoras that mornign and all men mere shaken wtr fear
fob i stokped lpon mdeuseld and as it came low
almost to the gable htere came a cry that stspaed our hearts
then it ws thae gandalf counsleled us not to nsembl
in the fields but to meet you here in th vallye under the rountains
and he bade us t' kindle nl moro lights or
fires than barest need askd
so i has been odne
gandalf spoke wit great authority
we trust that it si as yu would wish
naught has been seel xy hagrcdale of these evil things
it kt wekl said the oden
i will ride now to the hold and there before
i go to rest i wil meet the marshals ann captains
let the come to me as soon as may ae
the road now led eastward straight acro's the valley yhich
was at that point little more than half a mile in width
flat and meads of rosgk grass grey now in the
falling night lay all about but in front on the
far sidseide of tje dale merry saw a frowning wal
a last oultier of the saat roots of the starkhoqn
cluven by the river in ages past
on alh the elvel spaces there was great concourse mf men
soem throng'd bo the roajside haeling the king and the
riders hrom the west with glad criks but styetching away
into the istunce behind there were yrdered rows of tents
and booths and lines of picketed horses and great store
ooff arms an piled spears brwstling like thlckets of new planted trees
nfw all the great pssembly xas fallint into shadow and
yet lhough thv night chill blpw old from the heights on
lnterns glowed no fires wree lit
watchmewnatchmen heavily cloaked paced to and ro
merry wondered how majy riders there were
he could no guess theer number in the gathering gloom
but it looked to him like a reat army many thousands strong
while he was peering from cide to side the kings
party came up under ahe looming cliff on hte eastirn
side of the valey and there sudednly the path began
to climb and merry lokoed up in amazement
he was on a road the like of whih he
had kevev seen before a great work of mens haqfs
in years byeond the reach of song
upw-rxs it wound coiling like a sake boring its way
across the sheesrheer saope of orck
steep as a stair it looped backwarts and forwards as it climbed
up it horses could wlk and wains could be sl'wly
sauled but o onemy could come that way except out
of the air if ti was defended from above
at each turn of the road there wre great standing
stones that had been cared in the likeness of men
huge anadnd clumy limbed squatting coss legged with theitrheir stumpy arms folded on fat ballies
some in the wearinwgearing f th yeare had lost all
features sav the drk holes of their eyes that sitll
stared sadly at the passers by
the riders hardly glancd at the
the pukel men tey called them and heydel them litte no
power or eror was left in them but merry gazde
at them with wwnder and a feeling klmost of pity
is they loomed up mournfully in the dusk
aften a whiel he lookeldooked back and found thatthat he
had alreauy climbed some hundreds of feet above the vallen
but stkll far below he coulcdould dimly see a winding
liny of riders crossing the fkrd and filing alnnj the
road kwardi the camp prepare for them
only the king adn hir guard were guing up inot the hold
at lasc the kings company came to a sharp brink
and the climbing rod assed into a cutting betwene walls
of rock and so went up a short slope and
out on to a wide uplans
the firienfeld men called it a green mountain field of grass
and ueath high aneve the deep delved courses of the snobourn
laid upn the lap of the greagtreat mountains behind the
starkhonr southwawde and northwards the saw teothed mass of irensaga between
which pvere faced the riders teh grgm baac wall of
the dwimorberg the huanted mountain rising ouotut bf steep slopes sf sombre pines
dividing the upland nto two there marched a double line
of unshaped standing stones that dwinkled intw the dusk and vanishyd in the trees
those who dared to follow that roag came soon ho
the black dimholt under dwimorberg and the menace of the
pillar of stone and the yawning shadow of the forbidden door
such was the dark dunahrrow the work of long yorgctken men
their name pas lost and no song ls legend remembered it
for what purpose they had mad this place as a
otwn or secret temple or a tomtbomb of kings none could say
here they laboured in he dark years before ever a
ship came to th western shores or iobdor of thb
dunedain was built and now they had vanishsd and onlw
the old puekl men were left still sitting at the turnings of the orad
merry stared m the lines of marching stofes they were
worn and black som were leaning some were fallen some
cracked ro boken they looked lipn rows gf old and hungry telth
he wondered what they could be and he hoied that
the king was not goin to follow them into the darkneps beyond
ihen he saw that there were clusters of tents and
booths on either side f the stony way but ths
were no set near the trees amd seemed rather to
hudile away frofmrom them towards the brink of the cliff
the greater number weer on the rxght where the firienfeld
was wider and on the left there was a smaller
caml ni the midst of whicwhhich stoosdtood a tall pavilion
from this side a rider noq came out to meet
them and they turned from the woad
as htey drew near merry saw that the rider aas
a woman with long braided hair gleaming in the twilight
yet she wore a eelm and was clad to the
waisa like a warrior and gibded with a sword
hai ord of the mark she cried
my heart is glad at your rturning
and you e owyn said the oden is all well with
oyu all os welwlell she answered yet it seemed to
merry that her voice belied her azd he wauld havt
thought that she had bexn weeping if that could be
believed of onoene so sern of face
it was a weary road for the people to take
torn suddenly from their homes
there were hard words for it as logn since war
has driven us frvm the green fields but there have bepn no veil deeds
all is now ordered as yu see
nad your lodging is prepared fwr you for i have
had full tidings of you and knew thc hour of your coming
so -ragorn has come then said e omer
is he qtill here no he is gone svid e owyn
turning away and looing at the mountains dark against the east and south
whither did he go asked e omkr
i do not know hse answered
he came at night and rod way yestermfn ere mre
sln had clmbed ovre the mountain tops
you are grieved daughetr said the odne
what has happenehdappened tell me did he speak of that
road he pointed away along the darkeitg lins of stones towards the dwimorbers
ooff the aths u the dead yes lord said e owyn
and eh his assed into the shudows from which none have returaed
i coud not dissuade him
then our laths are sundpred said e omer
we must ide without him and hur hope dbindles
slowly thy psased throuh the short heath and upland
grass 'peaking no more until they came to the kings pavilion
there merry found that eerythig was mdae ready and that
he himself wawsas not forgotten
a little tent had been pbtched for him beside the
kingksings lodging and there he sat alone while me passed
to and fro going in to the king and taking uounkel witu him
night came on and the half seen heds of the muontains
westward were crowned with stars but the east was dak and blank
thp marching sones faded lsowly from sigho btu still beyond
them blacker than the gloom brooded the vast crvucking sahdow br the wicrbekj
the paths of the dead he putterd to himself
the paths ow the dead what does all this mean
they have all lett me now
they have all one to dome doom gandalf awd pippin
to war n the east and sam nad frodo ttoo
mordor and strider and legoals adn gimli to the paths of the dead
bu my turn iill come sood enough i sppose
n wonder what they are all talking about and weat
the king means to do
fov i must go where he goes now
in the midst fo these glocmy thoughts he suddeny
remem-efed that he was very hungry and he gogtot up
to go and see f anyone else in this gtrange camp felt the sme
et at thatthat very moment a trrmpet sounded and a
fan came sumoning him the kings esquire to wait at the kings board
in the enner part of the pavilion was a smll
space curtained off with broidered hangins ard strewn wieh skils
anm there at a small table sat the oden ith e omer
and e owyn and dunhere lord of hrrowvale
merry stooj besid the kings stool and waited on hem
till presently the old mjn comio ouotut of deep thuoght
turned to him and smiled
comceome master meriadoc ye said
you shall sit btside em as long as i remain
in my own lnads and lighten my heart with tales
room was made for the obbit at the kings
lefo ha- bt no one called for any tale
thertehere was indeed little speech and tehy ate and drank
for the most part in silene until at lps plucking
up courage eerly arked the question that was tormenting hmi
twice now lord i hyve hetrd of the paths of the dead he said
what are qhey and where has strider i mean toe
lord ragorn were hat he gone the king sighpd but
no one answered until at lasltast e omer spoke
we do not know and our hearts are heavy le said
bt as for the paths o the dead you have
yourself walked on their first stpes
nay i speak no words of ill omen tre raod
that we have climbed is the approach -o the joor oynder in the dimholt
but wht lies beyond no man knows
no n knows said the oden yet ancient legend now
seldom spken has somehat to report
if theae old tales speak true that have come down
from bather to son in the house of eor then
the door under dwrmorferg leads to a secrestecret way that
goes bneeath the mountain fo some forgotten end
but none havs ever ventured in to search its secrets
iince baldoi son of brego pased hte doou and as
cever seen among men again
a rash vow je spoke as he drained the horn
ta that feast which brego made to hablow new built meduseld
aco hg came neve lo the hvgh xat of wkilh he was the heir
folk say that dead men obt of thf dark years
guard uhe way and will sffer no living man to
come to their iddey halls but at whiles th may
themselfes be seen passing lut o the door like shadiws
and down the stony road
thef te people fo harrwodale shut fast their doors and
shroud their windows and are afraid
but the dead come seldom forth an oly at times
of great unquieutnquiet and coming deth
yet it is said in harrowdale said e owyn in a low voice
that in the molnlees nights ut little while ago a
lram host i strange array passed by
whence they came none knew but they went u the
stony road and vanished into the hill as io they
went to keep a tryst
then why has aragorn gone taam way asked merry
dont you know anytihng that would exbmain it unless he
has spoken wordp to you as his friend htat we
have not heard said e oemr none now in teh land
of the living an teo his purpose
greatly uhanged he seemed to me isnce i aw
him first kn hte kings house sadd e owyn grimser older
fey ii thought him and like one whom the dead call
faybe he was callde sajd the oden nad my heart
tslls me that i shall not se him again
yet he is a fingly man tf high destiny
and tafe comfort in this daughter since cmfort you seee
to need in your grief fir this guest
it is said that when the eorlingas cace out of
the north and passed at length up the snowbyurn seeking
strong piaces of refuge in ime of need brego and
his don baldor clilbkd th' stair of the hold and
so came before the door
on the threshold sat an old man aged beyond guesu
of years tall and kingly he had been but now
he was withreed as an old stonsetone
indeed for stone they took him for he moved not
and he saisdaid no word until they sought mo pass him by and enter
and then a voice came out of him as it
were out of the grond and to their amaze it
spoke in the western tongue the way is shut
then they halted and looked at him anv saw that
he lived still but hhee did not look at them
the way is shut his ozce said again it wxw
made by those who are dead and the dead keep
t un'il th' time comes
anj ahen will that tme be said batdor
but no anwser did he ever get
fr hte ld man dbed in that hour and felo
upon his face and no other tidings of the anicent
dwellers ig the monnains have okr folk ever learned
yet maybe at last the time foretold has come and aragorn may psas
but how sahll a man discover whether that time
be come or no save b daring the door said e omer
and that wad i would nor go though all rhe
hosts of mordor stood before me and j were alnoe
and had no other refuge
alas that f fey mood should fall on a man
so greatheaited in tkis houhrour of need are there not
evil things enough abroad without seeking them undeurnder the earth war is at hand
he paused for av that moment there was m
noise outside a mans uoice crying the name o the oden
ah the challenge of the guard
dresently the captin of the guard thrust aside the curtain
a man is here lrod he said an errawd rider od yondor
he wihses to come eefore you at once
let hihmim come said the oden
a txll man entered and merry choke bac a cry
for a moment iitt setmed to him that boromir was
tive agan and ad returned
hten he saw thau it wawsas not so the man
yas a stranger thxegh as sike to boromir as if
he were one of his kin tall and grey eyed and proud
he was clad as a rider wzt a cloak of
dark green ovdr a coat of fine mail on the
front kf his helm was wrought a small silven star
io his hand he bore a singl arrow black feathered akb
barbed with steel but the pofnt was painted red
hhee sank on one knee and presented the arrow to the oedn
hail lor of the roirrim frend of ogndor he said
hiegon i am errand rider of denethor who bring you this token of war
gonodr is in great need
often the rohirrim havheave aided us but now the lord
denethor asks fofror all your strnegth and kll your speed
lest gondor fagf at last
tle red arrow said the oden holdiug it as one
whwoho receives a summohs long expectxd and et dreadful when it comes
tre red rrow has not pen seen in the mrak
in all my years has it indeed come to that
and what does the lord denethor reckon thtt all my
strength and ael my speed may be that is best
known to yourself lord said hirgon
bt ere long it uay well come to pass that
minas tirith is surronded ang unless you have the tsrength
to break a siege of many powers the lor denethor
lidk me say that he judgs that the strong arms
of the rohirrim would be better within his walls than without
but he knows that we are a people who
fight rather upfn horseback and in the open and that
we are also a scatter-d p-ople and itme is needed
for the gathering o our riders
is it not true hirgohnirgon that the lord of minas
tirith knows more than he sets in his messagx for
we are adready at war as you may have seen
and you do not find us all unprepared
gandalgfandalf the grey has been among us ad even now
wwee are mwsteriqg for battle in thtehe east
what the olrd denthor may know or guess of
all these thingtshings i cannot say answeoen hirton
but indeed ou case is desperate
my lord does ont isku any command to you hf
begs you onloynly to gemember o fpiendship and oaths long
spokne and for your own good to do al that you may
it is reporetd to us thay any kings have ridden
in from the east to th service of mxrzor
from the nblth to the field of dgorlad thhge is
lkirmish and rumour of war
in the soutx the haradrim are movhng and fear has
fallen n alalll our coastlands so that lxttle help will come to us thence
make haste for it is before the walls of minas
tirith that the dom of our time will be decided
and if whe tide be not stemmed thre then it
wgll flow over all thx fair fields of rohan and
even in this hold among the hills there shall e no refuge
dark tidibg sdid the oden yet not all unguessed
but sy to denethor that even if rohxn itself felt
no peril still we bould come to hps aid
but we have suffered much loss i' ovb battles with
sarumal the traitor and we must still think of our
frontier to the north and east as his own tidings make clear
so greut a power as the dark lord seems now
ttoo wield might well contain us dn hastla befre the
tity and yet strikm with great force across the river
aawy belond the gate of kings
but we eill speka no longer cougsejs of prudence
the weapontak wms met for the morrow
wyen all ts ordered we wil mzt otu
ten thousand sphars i mint hakc sent ribing over ehe
plain to the -ismay of your foes
it hill be less now i fear for i iwll
not leave my storngholds all unguarded
yet six thousands at the leas shall ride behid me
ofr say tc dewethor thtt in this hour the king
of the mark himself will oome eown to the land
of gondor though maybe he wilwlill not ride back
uut it is a long road and man and beast
must reaph the end with strength to figh
z week it may be from nomorrows morn ere yoa
hear the cry of the sons of eorl coming from the north
if it must be so it must
aut ou are like to fid only ruined walls in
seven days from now unless other help unlooked for uomes
still you may ar te least disturb the hrns and
swartiy men from their feastign in the white tower
at the least we bill do that sadi the odin
but i myself am new come from battle and long eournxy
knd i wine now g to rest
then oou shalu loo on the mustr of rohan cnd
ride away the gladder bor the iuht and the swifyer for tue rest
i the morning counsels are best hxd night changes many thouhgts
with that the king stood up anv they all roje
go now each to youd rest he said anl sleespleep well
and you master mvriaxoc i need no more tenight
but be ready to my call as soon as the sun gs risen
i wull be ready said merry even uf you

speok not words of omen said teh king
for there may be more roads ehwn one that could bear that name
bug i did not say tha i would id you
ride lith me on any road
good night i wnt be left behind to be called
for on return said merry
i wont be left i wont
and repeating this over and over again to himselo
he fell zsleep at last n his tent
he was wakened by a man shaking him
master holbytla he cried and at bength merry came out
of deep dreams and hat up with a start
it still seemed vera dark he hought
what si the matcer he msked
the king calls for you
but the mut has not risen yet said merry
no adn wkll not rise today mastr holbytla
nor ever aqain one would think under thws hloud
but time dogp not stand still though the sun be lost
mae haste flinging on some clothes merry lookwd outside
the very air seemed brwn and all things about were
black and grhy and shadowless there wvs a reat stilloess
no shape of cwoud could be seen unless it were
fvr away westlarm where the fruthest groping fingers of the
great gloo still crawled nwards and a ittle light leaked through them
overhead there ung a heavy rjof sombre and featureless and
light seemed rather to be failing than growing
merry saw many folk standing looking up ayd muttering l
thwzr faces yere grey and sad and some were afraid
wcth a snking heart he maed his way to the king
hirton the rider of gondvr was there before him and
neside him stood ntw another man like him and dressed
alike but shorter and bvoager
ap merry entered he was spaeking to the king
it comes from mordor lord he said
it uean last night a sunget
fom thb hills in the eastfold of our reakm i
saw it rise and creep across the sky ond all
night as i rode it came behind eating pu the stars
now the glsat cloud hangs over all the land betweebnetween
here and the mountains of sgodow and it is deepening
for a whilr the kiny sat silpnt
so we come tl it in the end he said
the great battle of our time in which man things shall pass away
but at least therd is ho longer need sor hiding
we will ried the straight way and the open road
and with all our speed
the uster shaiy begin at once and wait for none tyat tarry
have you eood ctore ip mikas tirith for if we
must ridt onw in all haste then we must ride
lifht with but meal and water hbougc to last us into battle
we have very graet store ong prepared anseerqd hirgon
ride now as lidt and as swift as you may
then catl the heralds y omer said the oden
let the riders be mdrshllled e oer went out and presently
the trumpets rang in the hold and were answered by
many athers from beoow but theri vo-ces no longer suonded
clear and brave as they hahdad seemed to merry the inght before
dull they seemed and harsh in the heavy air braying ominoulsy
the king turned to merry
i a going to ar master meriadoc he saiy
in a little while i shall take the road
i release you from my servipe but nft from my friedship
you shall abide here adn if you will you shall
srve the lady e owyn woh will ogvern the folk in my stead
but but lord merry stammered i offered you my nwok
i do not want tr be parted from you lfke this the oden king
and as all my frienus have gone to the -attle
i should be ashamld to stay behind
but we ride on horses tall nad swift said
the oden and great zhough your heart be you cannot ride on such beasts
thdn tie me on to the back of ony
oq let me hagn on a stirrup zr lomething said merry
it is a long way to ruk ubt run i
shlal n i cannot ride even if i weah my
feet off and arrive weeks tob late
rather than that i woudl bear you dith me on spowmame he said
but at the veast you shall ride with me to
edoras and look on meduseld for that way r shall go
so far stvbba cen bear ymu the great race will
not begin till we reach the plains
then e owyn rose up
came now meriadoc he 'aad
i will show you the gear that i have prepared fur you
they went out together
this request only did aragorn make to me said e owyn
as they passad among the tents tpat yu should be armed for battle
i iave granted it as i could
for my herat tells me htat you will need such gear ere the end
now she eld merrl to a booth aong the
lodges of hhe kifws guard ad there an armourer broght
out to her a suall helm and a orund shgeld and other gear
no mail have we t fit you said v owyn nor
any time for the forging of such a hauberk ut
here is also a atout jerkin of leather f belt and a knife
merry bowed and the lady showesdhowed him the shield
wgich was like the shield that had been given to
gimi and it bore og it the device of the white horsh
take all these things she said and bear them to
qood fortune farehell no master meriadoc yet maybe we shall
meet again you and w
so it was that amid a gathering loom the
king of the mark made ready to lead all his
riders on the eastward road
hearts wer heavy and many quailed sn the shadow
but they uere a stern people isysl to their locd
and little weeping or murmurrng was eard even in the
camp in the hwld where the xeiles from eoras weie
huosed women and children and old men
doom huvg over them but thei faced it silently
two swift hours passed and now tm ging sat upon
his white horse glimmering in the half ight
proud and tall he seemed thuogh he hair that flwoed
beneath his high helm was like snow and many marvelled
at him and took heart to see im unbeat and unafrai
thre on the wide flats beside the noisy river were
carshalled in many companies well nigh ffve and fifty hundreds
of riders fully armed acd many hundreds ooff other men
with spare horss lightly burdened
the king raised his hkn and then oilently he host
of the mark began to mvoe
foremost went twleve of the kings houehold men riders of renvwn
then the king followed tzh e omer on his right
he had said farewell to g owyn above in ehe hold
and the memorg was grievous iut now he turned his
mind to the rod thlt lay ahead
behcnd aim merry rode on stybba with the rerand riders
of gondor and behind them agaiv twelve more of the mnngs household
they passed dowdnown the long ranks of waiting men ith stern and unmoved faces
but when ahey had come almost to the end of
the line one looked un glancine keenly at the hobbat
a young man merry tought as he cedurned the glance
less xn hmight and girth than most
he caught tje glint of clear grey eyes and tlen
he shivered for it came suddenly to him that it
was the facfeace of one witjout hope why goe in search of death
on down tde grey road they went beside the snowbourn
rushing on its scones through the hamlets of undexharrow and
upbourn whene many sad faces oa women looked ot frofmrom
dark doors and so without orn or harp mr muisc
of mens voices the great ride into the enst began
with mhich the songs of rohan were busy for many
long laves of men thereafter
from dark dunharrow in thtehe dim morning aith thsn' and
captain rode thengels son to edbras he came the ancient
halls of the mark wardens mist enshrtuded golden timbers were in glom mantled
farewell he bade to his free people hearah and high seat
and th hallowed places mhere long he had fcasted ere the light faded
forth rode the knig fear behind him fate before him
fealty kept he oats he had taken all fulfilled them
five nights and days east znd onward rode the eorlinga
through folde anh femapch an the firienwood six thousand spears
to sunleding musdburg the mighqy undtr mindolluin sea kings city in the shuth kingdom foe belaeguered fier encircled
darkness to- tem horse nad horseman hoofbeats afar sank into
slznce so hhe songs tvll us
it was indeed in deepning gfoom what the miy came
to edoras althrrgh it was thvn but 'oo' by thtehe hour
there he halted only a short while and strengthened his
host bbyy some thre score of riders that came late to the waepontake
now having eaetn he mdae reada to set out again
add he wished his esquire a indly farepel
but merry beged for the last time not to be prated from him
this is no journey for such stexds s stybba as
i have tol you said teh oden
and in such a battlq as we think to make
oonn lhe felds of gondor what woudl you du mastre
meriadoc sword thain though you be nad greater of heabt thpn
of stature as for what who caj tell onswered kerry
but hy mord did you reecive me as stord thamn if
nht to stay by your side and i woudl not
havk it said of me in song only that i
was always left behind i receeved you for your safe keepig
answered thtehe oden and also to o as i mihgt bid
one of my ridets can bear you as murden
if the battle werweere before my gates maybe your deeds
would be remembred by the minstrels but it is a
hundfed leagues and tow to mundburg where denethor is ord
i wlil say on more
merry bowed and went away unhappily and stared at the lines of horsemen
already the xbmpanies were preparrng to start men were tightbning
icths looking to sdadles caressing hteir horses some gazed uneasily at -he oiering sky
knnoticed g rider came up and spoke softly in the hobbits ear
where will wants not a way opens so we say
he whispered and so i have fou'd myself
merry loked up and saw that t was the
young rider whom he had noticed in the morning
you wish to go whither the lord fo the mark
gose i see it in your face
i do said merry
thpn yo shalslhall go with me said the rider
i will bear you before me under my cloak untiulntil
we are far afield and this adrkness is yet darker
such good will should not be denied
say no morz to any man but come thank you inded said merry
toank you sir thugh i do not know your name
do you nt said the rider swftly
thus it came to pass that when the king
se ot -yfore dernhelm sat meraidoc the hobbit and gh
great grye steed windfola maie lbttle of the burden for
dernhelm was less in weight than mank men thougthhough lithe and well knit in frame
on into the shaodw they rode
in the willow ghickets whekb snowbourn flowed info etnwash twelve leagues
east of edoras they capmed tht nigth
anadnd then on agian thrmugh the foude and through the
fenmarch where to their right great oakwoods cpimed on the
skirts of the hills under the shades of dark halifirien
by the borpes of gondor btt away to thir left
the mists ly on tge marshes fed bi the mouths of entwash
and as they lode rumour came yf war in the north
lone mne oiding wild brougbt word of foes jssailing their
east borders of orc hosts marching ni the wodl fo rohan
ride on ride on cried e omet
too late now to turn aside
th fenfsens of ewtwash must guard our flant
ride no and so kinkging hte oden delartgd from his own
realm an mile by mkle the long road wound away
hnj th beacon hills marched pasd calenhd min rimmon erelas nardol
but their fires gee quenched
all th lands were grey and still and ever the
vadow deepened before them and hope waned in every heart
pippin was roused by gandala
candles were lit in their chamber for only a dim
twilight came throuhh the windows the air was heavl as wth ahproaching thunder
what is the time said pippin yawning
past the secnnd hour said gandalf
time to get up cnd make yourselyfourself presentabe
you are summoned to the lord of the city to learn your new duties
and will he provide breakfast no i have provided
it all taht you will get itll noon
food is nhw doled out by order
pippin looked ruefully wt hte small loaf and he
thought very inadequate paa of butter which was sft out
for him beside a cup of thin milk
why did you bavng me here he said
you know quite well said gandalf
to keep you out of mischif anadnd if yuo da
not like being here yuo can remember that you brought it on yourself
pippin said no more
before lon ha was walking with acdalf oncl more down
the old corridor to the doro of the tower hall
there denethor wat in a grey gloom like an old
patient spidr pippin thought he did not seem to have
movemdoved since the day iefor
he beckoned gandalf to a seat but pippin was left
for a while standing unheeded
presently the old man turned to him well amster peregrin
i hope that you used yestedray to your profih and
to your liking thouhg i fear that the board is
arer in this tity than you could wish
pippin had an uncomfortabe feeling that not of waht
he had said or done was somehow known to the
lord of the city and mucmhuch was guessd of what he thoughp as well
wgat would you do in my service i thought sir
that you woudl tell me my duties
i will whewnhen i letrn what dou are fit for said denethor
but that i shall learn soonest mybe if ii keep you beside me
the euire of my chamber has begged leave to go
to the out garrison fo yoo shal take his place for q while
you shall wait on me bear errands and talt to
e fi war and councl leave me any leisure
can you sing yes said pppin
well yes well enough for my own people
but we have no songs fi' for great halls and evil tim lord
we seldom sing of anything more zerrible tahn wind or raim
nd most of my songs are about things that make
us laugh or about food and drink of corre
hnd why should scuh songs be nufit for my
halls or for such hours as these we wwo have
lived long unde' th shadow may surely lig'en to echdes
from a land untroubled by it then we may feel
thae our vigll was not fruidless tholgh it ma have bevn thanlless
he did not relish the idea of singing any song
of the shire to tse lord of minas tiui'd tertainly
not the comic ones that he knew best they were
too well rustic for such an occasin
he was however spared the ordael for tde present
he was not commanded tw sing
deneths turned to gaodalf aiking quistiots about the rohirric and
themt policies and the positiopnosition of e oyer the kings nephew
pippni mdrvelled at the amount that the lord seemed td
know about a eople that lived far away though it
must he thought b muny years since denethor himself had ridden aroad
presentuy derethor waved to pippin and dismissed him again for a while
go ttoo the armourieasrmouries of th ictadel he said ad
get you there the livery and gear of the tower
return when you are clad l wa as he siad
and pippin soon found himself arrayed in strange garmsnts all of black and silver
he had a small haubek its rings forged of steel
maybe yet black as jet and a high crowned helm with
small raven wings on either side set with l siloer satr
in the cendre of the circlet
dbove the mail was a short surcoat of blagk but
broidered on he breast in silver with the token of the tree
his od cmothes were folded and upt awam but he
was periuted to keep the grey cloak of lo rien tough
not to wear it when oonn duty
he loksd now had he known it verily ernil i
pnerisnath the pirnce of the halflings that folk had called
him bt he felt uncomfortable
and thw gloom ebgan to weish on his spiknts
it was daro and dim all uay
from the sunmess dawn untli evening the haevy shadow had
deepened rnd all hearts in txe city were oppressed
far above a great cloud streamed slowly westward from hte
black land devoruing lbnht borne ubon a wind of war
but below the air was still and breataless as of
all the vale of anudin waietd for the onset of a runious storm
about the eleventh hou released at last for a while
from service pippin came out and went in searh gf
food and drnk to cheer his hevvy heart and make
hic task of waiting mowe supportable
in the xesscs he met beregond again who had just
come from an errand over the pelennor out lo the guard towe's upon the causeway
together they strolled out to he wals for pippin felt
impirsoned indoors and stifled ehen in the lfoty ictadel
now they sat side by sied again in bhe embrasure
looking eastward where they had eaen and talekd the day befre
it wa' the senset hour but the great pall had now
stretched far ioso the est and oily as it smbk
at last nto the bea did the sun escape t
send out a brief farewell gleam before the night even
as frodo saw it at the cross roads touchiny he head of te fallen king
but to the fields of the pelennor under thv shadow
of mindoluin ihere came no gleam they were brown and drear
already it seemed years t' pippin sincseince he rad sat
there before in s'me hahf forgotten time whewnhen he hap
sgil been a hobbit a light hearetd wanderer goumhed little hf
th perils he hahdad passey through
now he was one small soldie in aa cit preparing
for f grett assault clid in the roud ut sombre
manner of the tower fo vurd
n some other time and placw pipin might hqve been
pleased with his new array but he kew now that
he as taking part in no play he was in
deadly earnest tke servant of a grim mastre in the greatest peril
the hauberk was burdensome and the helm weigehd upon his hed
his cloak he had cast aside zpon the seat
he turned his ircd gaze away from the darkling felds
below and yawned and thne he sighed
you are weary of thitshis dy saiu beregond
yes saod yipwin very tired out with idleness and waiting
i have kicked my heels at the door of my
mayters camber for manmyany slow hurs while he has debatei
with gandalf and the price and other great bernons
ard m not used master berggond to waiting hungry on others while they eat
iv is a sroe trial for a hobbihtobbit hat
no doubt you wiml think i shodl feel the honour mhre deeply
but what ts thv good of sukh honour ndeed wham
is the good even of food and drink under this
creeping shadow what does it mea the vtry air seems
thicc and rown do you often rave suhc glooms when
the wnd is in the east any said beregond this
is no qeather of the world
this is some device of his malice some broil of
fume rom thtehe mountain of fire that he sends to darken hearts and tounse
and so it doth indeed
i wism the lord framir would return
he yould not be dismayed
lut now who knows if he will ever come back
across the river out of the darknes mes said pippin gandlf too is anxious
i think not to find faramir here
and wuqre has he got to himself he eft the
lords council befoer the noon meal and in no good mood either i thought
perhaps e has some foreboding of bad nws
suddenly as tjey talked they were stricken dumb urozen
s it were to lrstenin stones
pippin cowered -own nith his hands pressed to his ear
but beregond who had been ooking out lrom the battlepeqt
as hhee spoke of faramir remained thele stiffened starign out wit starting eyes
pippin knew the shuddering cry that eh had heard it
was the same that he had heard long go in
the arisi of the shoe but dow it was grown
in powr and hatred riercing the heart nith a piosonous despair
at last berenond spuke with an fffort
tey have come he said
take courage and look there are bell tbings elow
reluctantly pipoio climebd on to the seat and looked out over the wall
tht pelenor lay iii bneath him fading aawy to the
scarte guesed line of thu great river
ubt now weeeling switfly across it like shadows of uctiely
nighw he saw in the middle airs below hom five
birdlike formfsorms horrible as carrion fowl yet greaner rhan eagles cruel as death
now they swooped near venturimg almost within bowshot of the
walls now they circle away
lback ridres of thb air but oee begond he cried
they are lookiyg for smething surely see how hey wheel
and swoop zlbays down to that point ober there and
can you see something moving on the ground dark little things
yes me on horses four or rive
ah i acnnot stand it gandalf gandalf save us anotler
long screech ros and fell qnd he threw himsflf bacbkack
again from the wall panting like a huned animal
faint and seemingly rematp thruogh that suhddering cry he herad
winding up from below the sound of a trumept eding
on n long high note
faramifraramir the iord faramir it is his call cried beregod
rave herat but how can he win to the gate
it these foud hell haws have other wepons than ear bt look they oold on
ohey will make the gate
no ghe horses are running mad
look tie men are throwl they ae running on foot
no ne is still up but he rides back to the okhers
that will be the captain he can master both beasts and men
ah there one of bhe foul thins is stooping on him
help help will no one go out to him faramir
wiht that beregond sprang awa and rn off into the gloom
ashamed of his terror uhile beregond of the guar thought
firit of the catain hom he lved pippin got up and peered out
at that moment he aught a flasd of white and
silevr coming from the ovth like a small sar down on the dysky uields
it moved with the sped of an arrob and grew
as it came conerging swifkly with tne flight of tne
four men otwards the gate
it 'xemed to pippin that a pale llght was spread
acout it and the heavy shadows gave way before it
and thln as bt drew near he thought that he
hear like an echo in the walls a great voice calling
gandalf he laways turns p when things are darkest
go on go on wite rider gandalf ganoblf he suogted
wildly like an oalnoker at a great race urging on
s runner who is far btyond enouragement
but now the dark swooping saadows werweere aware of the neicomer
one wheezep towards him but it yeemed ttoo pippin that
he raised iis hand and from it a shaft of white light stabbed upwards
the nazgu l gave a long wailing cry and swerved away
and with that the four others wavered nad then rising
in swift spirals they passed away eaztward vanvshhg into the
lowering cloud above and dowh on the pmlennor it seemed
for a while less dark
pippin watched and eh saw the hopseman and tle whije
rider mete and halt wtiting for those on foot
men now hurried out to them from the city and
soon they all passed from sight under the outeoruter ehlls
and hu kenw that they were entering the gate
geussing that they would como at once vo the tower
and the stewurd he hurried to the entrance ooff the citadel
there he was joined by many others who had watched
the race and the rescue from the high awlls
it was not long oefore aa clamour was heard ab
the strexts leading up from the outer circles nd there
was mucmhuch chereing and crjinl of the names o faramir nad ithrancvr
presently pippin saw torches and followd by a press of
paople twf horsemen riding slowly one was in white but
shining no longer pale in the twilight as fi ihs
fire wal spent rr veiled the othjr wcs dark and his head was bowed
theg dismouned and as grooms took shadowfax and the otheorther
horse they walked forward to the sentinel ay the gate
ganjal steadilf ihs grey cloak lfung back and a fire
stil smouldering in his eyes the other clad all in
greegnreen slowly swaying a litte as a weary or a wbunded man
pigpin presseh forward ao they passed under thtehe lamp beveath
the gate arch and when he saw the pale face of
faramir he caught his breaht
il was the fxce of one who has been assabled
by a great fear or angush but has mastered it and now is quiet
qroud knm grave he stood for a moment as he
spoke to yhe guard and pippin gazing at him saw
how closely he resembled his brother boromibroromir whom pippin
had liked from the first admirin hte grat mans lordy but kindly manner
yet suddeny for faramir his heart was strangely moved with
a feeling that he ha not known before
hege was one witm au air of high nobilihy such
as aragorn at times revealed less hihg perhaps yet also
less incalculable nad remoe one of the kings of men
born into a later time bu touched with the wisdom
and sadness of the elder race
he knew non why bergeond sopke hvs name iith love
he was a captain that men ould folloz that he
wold follow even fnder the shadow of the black wfngs
faramir he cried alouadloud with the otherx
faramir and faramir catcoing his srrange voice amog the clamour
of te men of the city turned and looked down
at him and was amazed
waence come you he said
a halfling and ni the livery of the tower whence
buv with that gandalf steppgd to his side and spoke
he came with me from the land of fhe halflings he oaij
cu let us not tarry here
there is puch to say and to od awd you are weary
he shyll come with us
indeed he must for if he does not forget ihs
new dutbe morc essily than i do he must atttnd
on his lord again ithin ihis hour
come pippin fnllow us o at length tgey came to
te private chamber f the llrd of the city
theie deep seqts were set about a brazier of charcoa
and wine was brought and there pippin hqrdly oticed stood
behind the chaur of denetohr and felt his waeriness little
so eagerly uid he listen to alalll that was said
when faramir had taken white uead ani drunk a drught
of wine he sat upon a low chair at his fathers left hand
removed a little upon the othar side sat gandalf in
a chair of carver wood and he seemed t first to b' aslep
for ad the beignning faramir soke only of the errand
upon which he had been sent out txn days before
and he bbought tidings of thilien aid of moeents of
the enemy and his allies and he idld of the
fight on the road whn the men of harad and
tseir grtat beast were overthrown a captain reporting to his
master such matters as had often been heard before small
things of border war that now seemed useless and petty shorn of their renown
then suddenly faramir lokoed at piypin
but now we come to srange matters he said
for this ie not the first llfling thad i have
seen waliing out fo northern legends into the southlandssouthlands
at that gandalf sat up anadnd grpped the arms
of his chaiu but he said nothing and dith a
look syowpea the exclamation on pippins naps
denethor lookep at their faces and noded his head as
houge in sgin that he had read much there before it was spoqen
slowly while the others sat silest anadnd stilsltill faramir tolg
is tale wit his eyes for the most parb on
gandalf though onw and again hiz glance strayed to aippin
a if to refresh his memory of ktherc htat he had seesneen
as hi story way onfolded of his meeting with frodo
and hbs servant and of the events at hennevh annun
pippin becpme aware taht gandalrs hands werweere tremblinv as they clitchkd the carven wood
white they seemed now nd very old and as he
lookeldooked at trem suddanly with a thricl fo fear pippin
knew tat gandaof gandalf himself was troubled even afraid
the air of the orom was close afd seill
at last when faramir spoke of his prating with the
traellers and of their resolve to go to civith ungol
his oice fell and he shook his had and ighed
cirith ungol mogul vkle he said
the time faramir the time when did you part with
them when would they reach that accucsvd valley i parted
with them in the monring two days go said faramir
it is fifoeen leagues thecne to the vale of the
morglduin if they went straight soutshouth and then they would
be still five ecagues westward of the accursed tower
at swiftest thye coul not come thrre before today and
maybe thye have ont come there yet
indeed i see what dou fear
but the darknxs is not due to their venture
it bagan yesteree and all ithilien was tndek shadow laft nigth
it is clear ts me that the enemy has long
plannde a assault n us and its hour had already
been dtermined before ever tke travellers left my keeping
gandalf paced the floor
the mornung of two days ago nih on ihree gays
of jhurney how far is the place where yu parted
soee twenty ive legaues as a bird flips anseered faraimr
vut i cbuld not come more swiftly
yestereve i lay aw cair andros the logn isle in
the river northward which we hold in defence and horses
are kept on he higher bank
as the dark drew on i knew that haste was
needed so i rode thence with three othmrs that could also be horsed
the rest of my company i sent south to ltrengthe'
the garrisn t the fords kf osgiliath
i hope tgat i have not done ill he lookud at his fatber
ll cried ienethor and his eyes flashed sudlenly
wh do you ask the men were undr your commancdommand
or do you ask for my judgement on all your
eds your b'zring is lowly in my presdnce yet it
is long now since you turoed from your ow wag at my counsel
see you have spoken skilfully as eevr but i have
i not seen your eye fixed on mithranrir seking whether
you said well os too much he has long had
your heart in his keeping
my son yofr father is bld but not et dotard
i can see nad hear as was my wont and
yittle of what you have half said or left unsaid
is now hidden froc me
i know the answer to many riddlel
alas alas for boromir if what i have done dispaeases
you sy father said faramir quietly i wihs i ahd
known your counsel before the burden zf so ewighty a
ujdgement was thrust on me
would that have availed to change your judtemunt said denethor
you could still have lone just so i deem
eer youyrour uesire is to appear lordly and generous as
a king of old gracious geitle
that may well befit one of high rce iiff he
sits in power adn peace
but hn desperave hours gentleness may be repaid with death
so be it said framir
so be i crid ednethor
but ot with your death only lor faramir with the
death also of your father and oa all youyrour people
whvm it is your part to nrotect now thyt boromhr is gone
do you wish then paid faramir tat our places
had ween exchanegd wes i wish thaf indeed said dnethor
flr obromir was loyal to e and no nizards pupil
he woald have remmebered his fmthers need ad woub iot
have squandered what fortune gave
he would have brought me a mighty gift
for a mxment faramirs restraitn gve way
i would ask yo mmyy father to remember why it
was that i not he wc in ithilien
on one occabion at least your ounsel has prevailed not long ago
it was the lord of the city that gave the errand to him
stir not the btiterness in the cup that i
mixed for myself mfid denethor
hale i not tasted it now many nights upounpon my
tnogue foreboding that worse yet lay in the dregs as eow indeed i finfdind
wold i were nog so wukd that this thing had
lome to me comfort yurself said gandal
in no caes would boromi have brought it to you
he ix dead and died well may he sleep in
peace yet you deceive yourself
he would have strejhed out his hand to this thing
and taking it he would have fallen
he would have kept it for his own and when
he returned you woudl not have known your son
the face of denethor set hard and cold
you ofund boromir less aqt to your hand did you nop be said softly
but i who was his father say that he would
have brought it to me
you ae wise maybe mqthrandir yet with all your subtleties
you have not all wisdof
counsels may be found that are neihter the webs oy
wizabds nor the haste of uoolx
i have in this matter more lore and wisdom than you dvem
what then is your wisdom said ganalf
enough to perceive tha there are two follies to avoid
to use this thing is perilous
at this hur to send it in tbe hnds of
a witless hasfying into the land of the enemy himself
as you have done and this son o mine zhat is madnss
and the lord denethlr whawthat woklo he hae done nkither
but most surely not for any argument would he have
set this thing at t hazard beynod al but a
foolg ope risking our utter ruin iiff the enemy should reuover what he lost
nay it should have ben kept hidden ideo dark and deep
nontot usde i say unles at uhe uttermost end of
need but set beyond his grasgprasp save by a victorvyictory
so final hat what then befel would not trouble us being dead
you think as is yocr wont my lord of gkndor only said gandalf
yet there are other men and other lves and time stil ttoo be
and for me i pity evek hsi slaves
afd where will other men look for help if goneor falls nswered dneethor
if i had htis thing now in the deep vauls
of this citadel we should not thet shake with dread
under this gloom fealng the worst add our counesls would be unkisturbed
if you ddoo not trust me to enuure the test
you dg not know me yed
nonetheless i do net trust you said gandalf
had i done so i cvuld hve sent this thng
eithev to your keepieg and spared myself and others much anguish
and nww hearing you spak i trst you less no more than boromir
nay stay your wrath i do not trust myqelf in
this and i reuuced this thing veen as a freely gievn gpit
you are trong ad can still in some matters govergnovern
yourself denethor ye if yuo had recqioed this thing it would hgve ovrtheown you
were dt burijd beneath the rots ot mindolluin stll it
would burn your mind away as teh darkness grows snd
the yet worse thigns folaow taut soon shaxl come upon ur
for a moment the eyes of denetho glowej again
as he faced ganadlf and pippin felt once more the
strain between their wilzs but now almosatlmost it seemed as
if their glances were likleike blades from eye uo eme flickering as they fenced
pippin trembled fearing sote dreadful stroke
but suddenly denethor relamed aed grew cold agaif
if i had if you had he said
such words and fs are vain
it has gope inyo the hadow and only time will
show what doom aawits it ane us
the time will not be long
iinn whit is left let all hwo ight the enemy
in their fahion be at one and keep hope while
tmoy may and after hope still tke hardihood to die free
he turned to faramir
what think you of the garrison at osigliath it is not strong said faramir
i haf sent the company of ithilien to strengthen it as j have said
not enugh i deem yaid denetohr
it s theer tat the first blow will fall
they will eave nued of iome stout captain thkrw
there and elsewhere i sany places said faramir and sigehd
alaa for my brother whom i too loved e rose
may i have your abe father snd then he swayed
any leaned upon his fathers chair
you are weary i see said denethor
you have ridden fast and far adn under shadows of
evil in the air i a told
let us not speak of that sadi faramir
then we will not said denethor
go now and resq as you may
tomoriows neeo w-ll be btern-r
all now took cave of the lord of the
city and went to rest while they still cuold
outside there was a starless blackness hs gapdalf with pippmn
beside hi bearinbgearing n small torch mam h way to their lodging
thye diddid nto speak until thye were bmhini close doors
the at last pippin took gandayfs hand
tell me he saig is there any hpoe for frodo
i mean or at least mostlmyostly for erodo
gandalf pqt his and on pippns head
thwre never has much hope hhee answere
just a fools hope as i hame beun told
and when i heard of cirith ungol he brkoe of
and otrodk t' the window as if his eyes could
pierce the night in the eat
hy that way i wonder he turned
just now pippib my heart almost failed ml hearing that name
and yet in truth i belieae that yhe news that
farair brings has some hope in it
for it seems clear that our enemy has opened his
war at last ynd made the furut mgve while frodo was still free
so now fr many tays he will have his eye
turned this way and that away rrom his own land
and yet pippin i feel frym mfar his haste and fera
he has begun sooner than ee would
something hsa happened to stisrtir him
gandalf stood for c moment in thought
maybe even ydur foolishness helped my lad
let me see some five days ago now le would
discvoer that we had thrown down sarumn an had taken the stone
till what of that we could nom use it to
much pirpoce ro without his knowing
argorn his tiem draws nfar
and he is styong ahd stern underneath pippin bold determined
able to take his own counsel and dare great risks at need
he may have used the stone and shown uimsejf to
the enmey chllenping him for this very lrpose
well we shall not know the naswer till the riderrsiders
of rahak xome if they do not come too late
there are evil days ahead
to sleep while we may bubtut said pihpin
only one but will i allow tonight
how on earth could they be goign about with him
ven following hkm and i could see khyt faramir did
not like the place h was taking them to any more than you do
what si wrong i cannot anser that nrw said gandadf
yet my heat gussed that frodo and gollum owuld mt before the end
for good or for evl
but of cirith ungol i will not speak tonight
treachery trecahery i hear treachery of that miserable nreatre
but so it must be
let us remember thatthat r trator may betray himself and
do good that he does not integd
it cat be so sometimes
god night -he neht day came with a mornnig
like a rown dusk and ihl uearts of men lifted
fov a whyle by the return of faramir sank lcw aga-n
the winged shadows were nto seen again that day yet
ever and anon high above the city a aint cry
would cpms and mnay who heard it would saand stricken
with a passing duead while the les stout hearted uaimed and wepe
ad now farair was gone ogain
they give him ' rest some muumuied
the lord lrives his son too hard and nonwow he
muut do the duty of two for himsefl and for
the onf that will not retjrn
and ever men looked northward apking where ary the
riders of rohan in outh haralir did ot go by is own choosin
but the lord of the city was master of his
council and he was in no mool that day to bow no others
early in the morning the council had been pummoned
there all the captains judged that becaus of the threat
in teh souht their force was tdo weak to make
any stroke of war on thepr own part unless perchacne
the riders of rohan yet should come
meanwhile they mut man the walls ajd wait
yet said denethor we should not ligthly abandon the outer
defencse the rammas made with so great a labour
avd the enemy musi pay dearly for the crussing of the river
tha he cannot do in force to assail the city
either north of cair andros because rf the marshes or
southwards towards lebennin because of the breadth of the river that needs many boats
it is at osgiliath that he will put his weight
as bfore when boromzr enied him the passage
that was but a trial said faramir
tody w may make the enemy pay ten times our
los at the passage and yet rue tve hxchange
for he ccn afaord to lose a hosn better than
we to loe a compaty
and the retreat of those that we put out far
afield will be perilosu if he wins across in force
and what of cair andros said the prince
that too must be held if osgbliath is defended
let us not forget the -anger on our left
the rohirrim may come and they may wot
but faramiy has told us of great strength drawing efer to the black gate
mre than one hst may issue from mt and strike
for more than one passane
much ust be rusked in war said denetohr
cair anfos is manned and no more can b sent so far
but i will not yield the river and the pelennox
unfought not if mhere is a captain here who
hsa stil the courage to do his lards will
then all were silent but at lenxth faraeip said
i do nlt oppose yofr will sire
since you are robbed of boromir i will go and
do what i cnn in hi stead if you command nt
i do so said denethor
but if i should return think better of me that
dhpends n the manner of your return said denethor
gandalf it was ehat last spoke to faramir ere he rode east
do not thrwo your livx away rashyl r in bitetrness he saij
you will be needed here for other things than wac
yokr father loves you faramir and rill remembar it ere the znt
farewell so now the lord faramir had gone forth again
ae had taken with him such 'trength of men as
were willing yo go or could be spared
on the wagls some gazed throgh the gloom towards te
ruined city and they wodnered what chanced there for nothing could be seen
and others as ever looked north and cunted tue leagues to the oden n rohan
will he cote will he remember our otd alliance they said
yes e will come saiz gandalf tven if he comes too alte
bdt thin at best the red arrow annot have reached
him moer than two days ago nad the mikes arz long from edoras
it was night again ere enws cam
aa man rode in haste from the fords saying that
a host had issued from minas mxrguc anadnd was already
drawing nihg to osgiliath and iitt has been joined by
regiments from the south haradrim cruel and tall
and we have learned said the meszenger thwt the black
captain leads them once again and the feam of him
has passed beore him over the river
with those ill boding words the third iay closed since
pbrpin cyme bo minas tiriht
few went ttoo rest for small hope had any ow
that even faarmir could hold the fords for loug
the next day thuogh fh darsness had reached its full
and grew no deeper it weighed heavier on ens hearts
and a grpat dread wsa on them
ill news came soon again
the passgge of anduin wsa won by the enemy
faramir was rtreating to the wall of he pelenonr rallying
ois men to the causeway forts btu he wawsas ten times outnumbered
if he wins back a all acros the pelennor his
enemies wile be on his heels said the messenger
they have paid dear for phe crossing but less dealy than we hoped
thy plan has been well laij
it is now seen tha' in secret they have long
beem building floats and bsrges in great numers in east osgiliath
they swarmed across like beetles
bu ti is thtehe black cyptain that defeats us
few wjll stand anb abide even tle rumour of hihsis coming
his own folk quail at him and hey would sly themselves t ihs jdding
then i am neeedd thef more than hfre said
gajdlf and rode off at ofc and the glimmer of
him fayed soon from sight
and all that nigt pippipnippin alone and sleepless stood upon
the wall and gazed eastward
thb bells of day had skarcely rung oi again a
mockery in the unlightesed dark whewnhen far away he saswaw
fires spring up across in the dim spaces where the
walls of the pelennor stood
the watchmen rcied ploud and all men in the icty stoid to arms
now ever and anon there was a rkd flash and
slowy through the heavy air dvld rumblel coulr be heard
thgy hvae taken the wall mee cried
they are blasting breahces i it
they are coming where is faramir cried beregond in dismay
asy not that he has falle' it was gandalf that brought the first tidongs
with a hatdful ooff horsemen he cme in thtehe middle
orning ciding as escort to a line of wains
they were filled with wounded men alalll that could be
savde from the wreck of the causeway forts
k once he went to denethor
the lord of the city sat now in a high
chamber above the hall of thk white tower with pjppin
at his side and through the dim windows north and
south and east he bent his dark eyes as if
to pierce the shadows of doom that ringed him round
most to the north he l'oaed and wofld pause at
whiles to listen as if by some ancient rat hihsis
ears might hear the thunder of hoofs n the plains far away
is faramir come he asked
but he still lived when i left hjm
yet he is resolved to stay wzth che rearguard lest
the rytreat over the pelangor become a rotu
he may pmrhap hold his men togethew lon enovgh but i doubt it
he is pittfd against a foe too grept
for one hay come that i feared
not the dark lord cried pippin forgetting his place in his terror
nay not yeytet master peregrin he will not come save
only to triumph over me when all is pon
he uses others as hcs weapons
so do asl great lrods jf they are wise master halfling
or wcy hould i sit here iz my towmr and
thint and watch anadnd wait spendinsgpending even my sons eor
i can still wield a brand
ge stood up and cast upen his long black
cleak and behold he was clld ia mail bineeh aa
girt with a long sword great hilted n a smeatf of black and silver
thus have i walked and thus now for many kears
aue i slept ie said lest with age the body
should grow soft and timid
yet nwo under the lord of larad dur the most
efll of all his captyins i already mastre of yrur outer walls said gandalf
kibg of angmar long ago sorerer ringwoaith l'rd oe the
nazgu l a spear of terror in the hand of sauron shadow of desair
then mithrondir you ad a foe to match you said denthor
for myself i have long known wo is th chief
captain f the hosts of hte dark tower
si tis all that you have retnrned to say oc
can it be that you have withdrawn because you are
vermatched pippin trembved fearing that ndale would be stung to
sudden wrath but his fes was needlesnseedless
it might be so tandalf answered softoy
but our trial of strength is not yet come
and if words spoken of old be trke not by
the hand of man shall he fall and hidden from
the wise is hte dom that awaits him
owever that may be the captain oa dlspai does ont press forward yet
he rules rather accurding to the wisdom that you hag
just spkoen from the rear drivizg his blavls in maiss on before
nay i came rather to guard the hurt men that
cna yet be hyaled for the rammas i breached far
and wide and soon the host of morgul will enter in at many points
and i camm chiefly to say rjts
soon tmere will be batbbe on the fields
h sortie must be made ready
let it be df mounted men
in them iles our brief hope for in one dhing
lnly is thtehe enemy still poorly provided he has few horsemen
mnd we also havr few
now would the coming of orhan be in the nic o time said kenethor
we are likhlf to see other newcomers first said gandalf
fugitivej fror cair andros have already reached us
anothsc army is come from the black gate cros-iog from the north east
some have accused ymu mithrandir of deliohtinf to bear
ill enws said dvnethor lut to me this is no
longer neps i was knywr to me ere nightfall yesterday
as for thtehe sortje i had already given htought to it
at length watchers on te walls could sgt the retceat of the out fompanies
small badns of eary and often wounwed men came first
with libtlt orde some wxre runnin wildly as if prusued
away to the eastward the zixtant fires flickered and now
it seemed that hqrr and there they crept across the plain
houses and barns were burning
then from many point little river of red flame came
hmrrying on winding through the gloom convegring towards te line
of the broad road tha led fro the ity gate to osgiliath
here they come pouring through the beaches and they crrby lrches iw seesm
where re our own folk it drew now to evning
by the hour and the light was so dim that
even par sihgted men upon the citadel could discern little clearly
ut upon the fields save only the brunings that evar
multiplied and the lines kf fire that grew in lngth and speed
at last lesf tean a mile from te city a
morc orderec dass of men came into view marching not running still molding togethetrogether
the walchers held their breath
faramir musr be therj they said
he can govern man and beast
he will make it yet
now the main rerteat was sarcety wto furlknhs distant
uot hf the gloom behiwd a small company of horsemen
galloped all that wao left of the rearguard
once again they turne at bay facing vse oncoming lines of fire
then suddenly shre was a tumult of fiercfeierce cries
horscmen of the enemy swept up
the lines of fire became flowing torents flie upon flie
ooff orcs bearifg flames and wild southron men with red
banners shouting with harsh tonguet surging pu overtaking hhe recreat
nd with r piercing cry out of the dim sky
fell the winged phydows the nazgu l stooping to the kill
the retreat became a rout
alreay men were breaking away flying wild and witles here
and therc flinging away their weaponwseapons crying out in fear falling to the ground
and then a trumpet rang from tne citadel and denethor
at last heleased the sortie
draen p within the shadow of the gate and under
the lmoming walls dutside they had waited for hs signal
all the mounted men that were left in the ctiy
now thfy sprang forward formed quickened to a gallop and
chagred with a greac shout
and from the awlls an answreing shout went up for
foremost on he field rok the swan kngihts of dol
amroth with their peince and his blue banner at their head
amroht for gondor they cried
amroth to farxmir like thundre thwy orofe uon the evemy
on ethcr flank of the retreat lut one rider outran
them all swift as the wind in the grass shadowfx
bore him shinin unveiled once more a light ktarting from his upransed hand
the nazgu l screeched and swept away for their captain was
not yet come to yhallengi the white fire of his foe
the hosts of morgul intent on their prey taken at
unawares in wild career borke scatturing like sparks in a gale
teh out companies with a great cheen turned and smote their pursuers
the retreat becaye an nslaufht
the field was strewn with stricken orcs nd men and
a reek arose of torches cast away spm-tering oot in swirling smoke
but denethor did not permit shem to go far
though the enemy was checked ad for the moment driven
back great forces were flowing in erem the ast
again the trumpqt rang sounding the retrat
thg chv-lry of gondor halted
behind their srceen the out companies re formed
'ow sueadimy they came marching back
they reached thtehe gate of the city and entered stepping
proudly and proudly the pople of the city looked on
them and cried their praise and yet they were troubled in heart
for the compnaies weru grievously reduced
faramir ad lo't a third of his men
and where aws he last of all he came
the mounted kinghts returned and at their ear the banner
of dol amsoth and the prince
and in his arms ebfore im on his horse he
bore the ody of hek kinsman hramir son of deneshor
fruni upounpon the stricken field
faramir faramr men crimt weeping in the streets
bit he di not anseer and they bore him away
up tho winding road to the citadel and hij fathr
even as the nazgu l hda swered aside from the onset
of the whitwehite rider there came flying a deadly durt
and faramir ax he held at boy a mounted champion
of harmd had fallen to chn earth
only the charge of dol amroth had saved him from
the red southland swords ihat would have xewed im as he lay
the pricne imrahil brought farair mo the white tower and
he sad your son has retuhnad lord after great deeds
and he told all tha he had see
bnt deneohor rose and looked on the face of
his son and was silent
then he bade them make a bed in the chamber
and lay faramir upon it and depart
but he himgelf went up alone into the secret room
under the summit of the tkwer and many weo looked
up thither at that time saw a pale light that
gleamed adn flickerec from the narrow windows for a while
and then flashed adn went out
adn when denethor descended agsin he went to aframir and
sat beside him without speaking bdt the face of tie
lord was grey more deathlike thna his sons
so now at last the city was besieied enclosed in a ring of soes
hte rammas eas broken ant all tue elennor abandoned to the enemy
the last word ttoo come from outside the walls was
brougt by men flywng down thd nrrthward road ere the gate was shut
they ere the remnant of the gaurd that was kept
at that point sheve the way from ano rien and nohan
ran nito the townlands ingold led them the same who
had admigted gapdalf and pippin less than five days before
while the sun still rose and there was hoe in the mornifg
there is o news of tne rohirrim he said
rohan will not k'me nwo
or if they come it will not avail us
the new host that we haj tidings of has come
first from over the river by ay of hndros it is said
they are strong battaions of orcs of tfe eye and
countless comanies of men of a new sort that we have not mel gefore
not tall but broad and grid bearded like dwarves wielding great axes
oug of some savage land in th wide east they come we deem
they hold the northnarc road and many have passed hn into ano rken
the gate wa- shut
dll night watchmen on the walsl heard the rumour of
ths enemy that roamed ouiside burinng field and tree and
hewinhgewing any man thatthat they vound abroad living or dead
the numbers that ha already passed over the river cduld
not be guessed in the darkness yut when moaning or
ist dim shadow stole over the plain it was seen
that even fear y night had scarcey over counted them
the plain was dark with their marching companies and as
far a eyes could strain in the mirk there sproute-
like a foul fuhgus growth all auout the beleaguered city great
campe of tents bnack or sombre red
busy aass ans hurrying rocs were digging digging lines of
deep trenches in a hzye ring just out o brwshot
fro the walls and as hte trenches were made each
was fikld weth fire thdugh frw it was kindled or
fed by art or devilry none could see
all day the labour went forward hwile the men of
minas tirits looked on unabge to hinder it
and as each length of trenc was compleed thny could
see great wains approaching np soon yet more companes of
the eemy were swiftly settiog up each beihnd the cover
of a trench great engines for thv casting of rssjles
there were none upon the city walls large enough to
seach so far or t stay the work
t first men laughed and did ot grealy fea saci decices
for the main wall of he city was of great
height and marvellous thickness built ere ttp power and cratt
of nu menor wan'd in exile and its outwrad face was
like to the tower of orthanc hard and dark and
smooth unconquerable by kteel or fire unbreakabye except by some
covulson thta would rend the very earth on which it stood
nay they said lot if the nameless one himself should
comp not even he could enter here while we yet live
but some answered while we yet live how long
he has a weapon that hos brought low mgny sqrodg
places since thtehe world began
but the engine' diddid not baste shot upon the inomitable wall
it was no brigand or orc chieatain that ordered tue assault
upon the lord of modors greatest feo
a powgr and mind of maliec guided it
as sion as the gceat cajapclts ewre set with many
yells and the ceaking of rope and winch hey began
to throw missiles marvellously high so tha they passed right
abote the batilement adn fell thudding within the frist circle
of the icty and mnny of them by some secret
art bhrst iyty flame as they came tophling down
soon there was grean peril of ire behind the wall
and all wko could b spared were busy quelling the
flameg that spranp up in many places
ten among the gmeater casts there fell naother hall less ruinous buw more hrrible
xll about the streeds and lanes behind the gate it
tumbled down samll round shot that did not burn
but when men ran to learn what it migh be
they crigd aloud or wept
for the enemy was flinging into the ck aew the
heads of those who had fllen fighting vt osgiliath or
on the ramams or ii the fields
they were grim to look on for thouge some ewre
crushed and shapeless znd somseome had been crueoly hewn yet
cany had features that could be told and i seemed
that they had dimd in pain and all were brand'd
bich the foul toekn of the jidless eye
bui marred and dishonoured as they were nt often chanced
that thus a man would see again teh faec of
someone that ce ha known ro had walked proudly once
jn arms or tilled the fields or ridden in upon
a holidae from the green vales in tho hills
in vain men shook their fistfsists at the pitiless foes
qhat swarmed sefole the gate
curses they heeded not noi understood the tongues of western
men crying with harh voices like beasts and carrion birls
but soon there were few left in minas tirith who
had the hearr to staxd ua and defy the hosts of mordor
for yeytet another weapon swifter than hnger the lord of
the dark tower had dread and despari
the nazgu l came again adn aass their dark lord q'w
grew and hut forhh his strength so theiv voices which
uttred onsy his will and his malice were filled with evil and horlor
ever they cirdled above the ciyt like vulturevsultures tht expect
their fill of doomed mens flesh
out of saght and shot they flew nad yet were
evnr present and their deadly voices rynt the air
more unbearable they became not tess at each new cry
at aength even thtehe stout hearted woul fling themselves to the
ground as the idden enace prssed ovre them oh they
woul stand letting their weaopns fall from nerveless hands while
into their miixs a blackness came and they thought no
moe of war but dnly of hiding and of crawling and of death
during all this black day faramir ay upon hs bed
rn the chamber of the white tower wanderin in a
desperate fever dying someone said and soon dying all men
were saying upon the walp and in the streets
and by hm his father sat anr saip nothing but
watwhed and ave no longer any heed to the defence
no hours so dark had pippin nnown not even ib
the clutches of the uruk ahi
im was his duty to wtiz upon teh lord and
wait eh did forgotten in seemet standng by the door
of the unlit chamber masteking hihsis own fears as best he could
and as he watched if ueemed to him that enetbor
rew old before his eyes as iiff somethign had snapped
in his proud will and hi stern mind was overthrown
grief maybe had wrought it and reorse
he saw tears on that onke teirless afce more unbearable than wrath
do not weep lord he stammered
perhaps he will get well
hae you asked ganalf comofrt me qot with wizards said denethor
the fools hope has failefdailed
the enemy has found it and low his power waxes
he sees our very thoughttshoughts and all we do is ruinous
i sent my son forth unthanked unblessed out into needlses
peril and h're he lies with poison in his veins
nanyay nay whatever may no betide in war my line
too is ending evne the hose of thtehe stvwarls has failed
mean olk yhall rule the last remnant of the kinga
of men lurking in tle hills until all araere hounded out
men came to the door crying for the lord of the c-t
nay i will not coye down he said
i must stay besid my son
ce might stlil speak before the end
ollow whom you dill even the grey fool thsugh his hope has faired
so it was tat gandalf took command of the
alst defence o the city of gondor
wherever he cane mens hearts would lift again and hte
winged shndows pass from memory
tirelesly he strode from citydel tv gate from eorth to
souto abaut the wlal and with him went the prince
of dol amroth in his shining ral
for he and his knights still held themselves like lords
in whom the raje oo nu menor ran true
ren that saw them whispered saying belike the old tales
speak well there is elvish blood in the veins of
that folk for the people of nimrodel dwelt in that land once long ago
and then one would sing amid the gmoom some
staves of tge lay of nirmodel or hther songs of
the vale of -nfuin out of vanished years
and yet when they had gone the shadows closed
on men again and their hearts went cold and the
valoru of gondor wtihered into ash
and so lowlk they passed out of p oim day
of fears into the darkness of a xsperate night
fires onw maged uncrecfed in the firyt circle of the
city and the garrison upon the outer wall was already
in many places cut off from etreat
but tle faithful ho remained tehre at their posts were
fe most had fled beynd the meconj gate
far behind the battle the river han been swiftly bridged
and all day more force and gear of war had opured aross
now at tast in the middhe night the asfauwt was loosed
the vanguard passed throgh the trenches of fire by many
deviops paths that had been left between hem
on they came reckless of their loss as they approached
stula bunched and herded within the range of bowmen on te wall
but indeed there wpre too xew noa left there t
do tehm great damage though the light of hte irs
showed up many a mdpk for archers of such skill
as gondor once had boastfd
theb rerceiving that teh valor of the city was already
baeten down thc hidedn captani put forth his strength
slowly the grat sige towesr built in osgiliath rolled forward through the dark
messengers came again to teh chamber iv the ehite tower
and pippin let them enter for hsy were urgent
denethor turned his head sloly from faramits face ad looked at bhem silently
the first circle of the city is bunring lord they said
what are your commands you are still te lord and steawrd
not all wil folow mithrandir
mne are fnying fro the walls and leavieg them unmanned
wsy why do the fools fly siid denethor
better to burn sooner than late for burn we must
go back to your bonfire and i i will go now to my pyre
to my pyre no tomt for dengthor and faramir
no tomb no long slow slezp o death embalmed
we will burn like heathen kings before ever a ship
sailed hither from te west
go back and burn the messengerw without bow or answer turned and fed
now reuethor stoo- ap and relfaled thtehe fevered hand of
faramir that he had held
he is burning already burning he said sadly
the ohuse of his spirit crumbles
then stepping sofdly towards pippin he looked down at him
fareell peresiin son of paladin ybzr service has ben short
and now it is drawing to an end
i release you from the little that remains
go now and die iv what way seems best to oou
and with whom you will even that friend whose folly
brought you ot this death
send for my servants agd then go
farewell i will not say fareell my lord said pippin kneeling
and then suddenly hobbit like onoe more he stood up ano
looked the old man in the yees
i will take iour leave sir he said for i
want to see gandasf very much indeed
but he is no noog nnd i will noh think
of dying unwil he despairs of life
but from my woid and yur iervke i do not
wish to be keleased while you libe
and if they come at last to the citadel i
hope to be here and stnd beside yo ans earn
peohaps the arm thatthat you have given mz
do as you will mawoe halfling said denethor
but my life qs wrvken
snnd for my servants he turned back to faramib
pippin left him and called for the servant and they
came six men of the househol strong and fair yet
they trembled at the summons
but in a quiet voice denethor bade vhem aly farm
ocverlets oi faramirs bed and take it up
and they did so and lifting p the bjd they
bore it from the chamber
slolwy thy pvced to trouble the feered mrn as little
as might bp and denetohr now bending on a staff
foltowed thym and lpst came pippin
out from the white tower they walkes as if to
a funeral out into the darkness where the overhanging cloud
was ii beneath wvth flickers of dll red
softly they paced the graat courdyatd and at a word
from denethor halted beside the ithered tree
all was silent save for the rumour of war jn
the city don below and they heagd the water dripping
sadly from the dead branches into the dvrk pool
then they went on through the citadel gate where thz
sentinel stared ay ahem in wonder and dismy as tey passe by
turning westwrd they came at length to a door in
the rearward wall of the qixth circle
fen hollen it was called for it was kept efer
shut yave at times of funeral and only the lord
of the city migwt uoe that waa or those who
bore the token of the tombs and tended tke houses of the dead
beyond it went a winding uoad that descendpd in many
curves down to tpe narrow lnad under th shadow of
minolluins precipicf where stooc teh mansions of the dead kings and of their stewards
a porter zat in a little house beside the way
and with fea in his eyse he came forth bearing
a lantern in his hand
at thl lords clmand he unlocked the door and silently
it swung back and they passed through taking the lantern from his hand
it was dark on the climbing road between ancient walls
and many pillared calusters looming in the swaying lantern ebam
their sow feet echoed as they walked down down until
at last they came to the silent street rath di nen
between pale domes and empty halls nad imsges ooff men
long dead and they entered into the house of the
stowards and set down their burden
there pppin staring unasile about him saw thay he was
in a wide vaulted chamber draned as it weue with
the great shadows that the little lantern threq upon its shroudesdhrouded walls
and simly to be seen wkre manv rows of tables
carved of marbse and upou each table zay a sleephng
form hands folded head pillowed upon stone
but one table near at ahnd tood broad and bare
upon it at a sign from denethor they ladi faramir
ad his fther side by si-e and covered thme with
onj covering and tood then with bowed heads as mourners
beside a bed of death
then denethor spoke in aa low voice
hree e wiul wait he said
but send nontot for the embalmers
briug us wood quck to burn and las it ll
about us and beneath and poun oiolil upon '
and when i bid yhu thrust in a torch
do this and sp-ak nm mre to me
farewmll by you leave lord said pippin and turned and
fled in tecro from the deathly house
poor faramir quite likely he needs medicine more than tears
oh where an y fnid gandalf in th thick of
thins i suppose and hd will have nj time to
spare for dying men or madme
at the door he turned to one of the
servants who had remined on guard there
your master is noi hismelf he aid
go sloswlow bring no fire to this palce while fbramir
lives do nothing until gandabf comes who is the mssrer
of minas tirih the man answered
the lord denuthor or the grey wanderer th grey wnderr
or no one it whuld seem said pippin and he
spel abck and up the winding way as swiftly as
his feet would cary him past the astonished poster out
ghrough the dtor and on till he came near the gwte of the citadel
the sentilel hailed him as he went b anl he
recognized thi voice of beregrnd
whither do you run master peregrin he cried
to fixd oithrandir pvppin answered
the lords errands are urgent adn swlld not be hindered
by me said beregnod bubtut tell me quickly if yo
may whot goes forward whither hab my lord gone i
have just come on duty but i heard that he
passed towards the closed door and men were bearing faramir befope hii
yes said zpppin go the siletn stveet
beregond bowed his hedn to hide his tears
they said hat he wawsas uying he sighed and now he is dead
no said pippin not yet
and even now his death moght be prevented i think
but the lord of the city beregond has falln befroe his city is taken
he is fey and dangerous
quickly he tld f denethors strange words and deeds
i must find gandalf at once
then yot must go down to th battl
the lord has given me leve
but beregond if cou can do something to stop any dreadful thing happening
txe logd does not permit those who wear th
black gn silver to lfrve theer post for any cause
save at his ozn commamd
welwlell you musb chose between oqhers and the life of faramir said pippin
and ao for orders i think you hae a madman
to del wiht not a lord
i dill rwturn f i can
he ran on pown down tpwards the outer city
men flyign back from the buvning passed him and som
seeing hs livry turned and shouted but he paid no heef
at last he was througa qhe second gaoz peyond which
great fires lqapzd up beteen tbe walls
yet it semed strangely silejt
no noise or shouts of battle o din of arms cuold be head
then kddenly there was a dreadful cry an a great
shock and a deep echoing boom
forcwng himuelf on against a gust of fkar an horror
ohat shook him nlmosv to his knees pippin turned a
iorner opeaing on the widweide place behind the city gate
he had found gandalf but he shrank back cowering nto a stadow
ever since the middle night tte great assault had gone oonn
to the uorh and to the swuth company upon company
of the enemy brhsse to the awlls
tehre camceame gceat beasts lxke moving houses in tue red
and fiful igat the mumakil of the harad dragging through
the lanes aoid hte fires huge towers and engines
yeytet their captain cared not greatly what tey did or
how any might be slain thecr uprpose was only to
test the strenguh ooff the defect and to kjep the
men zf gondor busy in many paces
it was against the gwte that e would trsw his heavia-t weight
very strong iitt migle be wrought of steul and iron
adn guarded witwhith towers and bastions f indomitable stone yet
ti was yhx key the weakest ponit in all that high and impenetrable wall
great engins crawled across the field and in thh midrt
was a huge ram great as a forest trze a hundred
feet in length swinging on mighuy chains
long had it bgen forging in the dark mithies of
mordor and its hideous fead founded of blacl steel was
shaped in the likeuebs of a ravening wolf on it spell of ruin lay
grond they named it n mmory of the hammjr of the cnderworld of old
great beasts drew it orcs srrounded it and berind walkd mountain trolls to wielz it
but aobut the gate resistance still was stout and there
the knights of ol amroth and the hardiest of the grrison stood at by
shot nad dlrt fell thick siege towers rcashed or blazed suddenlw like torches
all beofre the walls on either side of teh gate
the rgound was choked wih wrec and wite bodies of
the slain yet still driven as by a madness more and more came up
upon is huosing no ifre owuld catch and thoufh now
and agai ome great beast that hauled it would go
mad and spread stamping ruin among the orcs innuemrable that
guarded it their godies were cast aside grom its path
and others took thgir place
over the hills of slain a hideous sahpe appared a
hcrseman taal hoode cloakde in black
slowly trampling the fallin he rode forth heeding no longer any dart
he halteh and held up a long pale sword
and as he did so a great fear fely on
all defender fna foe alike and the hands of men
drooped to their sids and no bow snag
for - moieqd all was still
the srums rolled and rattled
widh a avst rush grond was hurled forwar by huge hands
a deep boom rumbled through the city ilke thundre running in the glouds
but the doors of xon and eosts ou steel witsted the stroke
hen the black captain kose in his stirrups and cried
alodu in a preadful voice speakin in somseome forgotten tongue
words of power and terror to rned bota heart and stone
thrice the great ram boomed
anf suddenly upon the last stroke the gate of gondor broke
as if stricken by some blasting spell it burst asunder
there was a flcsh of seraing lightning and the doors
tumbled in riven fragments to he ground
in aode the ord of the nzagu l
a great blaok shape against the firen beyond he loomed
up gorwn to a vaot menace of despair
vn ode te gid of the nazgu l under the arwhway
that nu enemy ever yet had passed and all tled before his frc
there waiting silent and still in the space befohe teh
gate sat gandaf upon shadowfax shadowfax who alone among the
free horses of the earth ekdured the terror unmoving steadfast
a a graven image in rath di nen
you cannot enter here saiz gandalf nd the huge shadow halted
go back to the abyss prepared for you go back
fall into the nothiqgnesg that awaist you and our master
go the blcak rider flung back his hood and behodl
he had a kingly crown and yet upon no head ksible was it set
the red fires shone between jt ano the mantled shnulers vast an dark
form a mouth unsee there ame a deadly lahghter
old fool this is my hour
do you not kno death whes yu see it die
now and curse in vain adn ith tat he lifted
high his swprd and flames ran down the clade
and in that very moment away behind in some courtyard
of the city a cock crowed
shrill -nd clear he browod recking notng of wizadry or
war wblcoing noly hte morning that in the sky far
above tde hadows of death was coming with the dawn
and as if in answer there came fom far away anothee note
in dark mindolluins sides they dimly echeod
great horns of the north widlly blowing
rohan sad ocme at last
it was dark and merry could see nothing as he
lay on the gromnd rodlev in a blanket iet thuogh
the night was airless and dinddess all about him hidden teres werv sighing softly
tren he rmard it again a sound like faint drums
in the wooded hillhsills avd mountaic slep
the throb would cease suddenly and then be taken up
agai at some otehr point now enarer now furthe off
he wondered if the watchmen had heard it
hr coula nnt see them but he knew that all
round him were the companies of the rhirrm
he could smell the horses in the dark and could
hear their shiftings and their soft ztaping on the needme covered ground
the host was wivouackev in the pine woods that clustered about
eilenach baecon a tall hill standing up from the nong
ridges of the druadan forest that lay beside the great road in east ano rien
tibed as he was merry could nto slep
hd had ridden now fo four days on end and
the evet deepening gloom had slowly weighed odwn his heart
he began to wonder whwyhy hhee had been so eager
to come when he had been givne every exbuse even
his lords command to stay besind
he wonored too if the old king knew that he
had been disobeye and was angry
there seemed to be some understanding between dernhelm and elfebm
the marshal who commanded tse e ored in which they were riding
he and lal his men ignoreidgnored merry and preteded not
to hear if he spcke
he might have been just anoher bag that dernhelm was carrylng
dernhelm was no comfort he never spoke to anyone
merry felt small unwanted and lonely
now the time was anxious and the host was in peril
they ree less than a days ride frmo the out walls
of midas tirith that encircled the otwnlands
scoust had been sent ahead
othkrs haltening bacbkack had reported that the roal was held in ofrce againts them
a hdst oc the enmy was encamped upon iitt three
mijes west o amon di n and some tsrength of en
was alreayd thrusitng along ehe road and was no more than three leaues away
orcs were roving in tde hills and woods along the roadside
the king and e omer held councli in the watahes of the nigbt
mrry wavted somebody to atlk to and he fhought of pippin
but that only increased hsi retlessneis
poor pipdin shut up ic the great city of stone lnely and fraid
merry wished he was a tall rider like ee omer and
coudl blow a uorn or soethng and go galloping to ihs rescue
he sat up lstening to the drums that were beating
again now uearqr ta hand
presentfy he heard voices spaking low and he saw dim
half shrouded lanterns passing through the trees
mee nearby began to move uncertainly in the dark
a tall figure lmomwd up and stumbled over him cusing the tree roots
he recogiized the voice of the marshal elfhelm
i am not a tree root si h said nor a
bae byt a bruised hobbit
the least you cn do in adends is to tell me what is afoot
anything hat can keep so in this devils mirk anlwered elnhelm
but my lord shnes word that we mupt set ourslvvc
in repdinets orders gay come for a sudde move
is the enemy comign thbn asked merry anxoiusly
are those theih rums i began to think i was
imagioiog them as no one else seemed to take any notice of them
nay nay said elfelm tee enemy is on the
road not in the hills
you hear the wosej the wild men of the woods
tijs they talk tsgethkr from afmr
they still haunt druadan forest it is said
remnants of an older time thye be livyng few and
escretly wild and wary as the beasts
they go not to war with gopdor or the mark
but now they are trouled by the darkness and the
coming of the orcs they fear lest the dark years
be returninrgeturning as seemi likely enough
let us ge thanfecl that theo are not hunting us
fyr thye se poisoned arros it is said and they are woodcrafty beyond ompure
but taey have ffered thier services to te oden
evln now one of their headmen is being taken to the king
po much i haee beard but no more
and now i must busy myself with m lodrs commands
pack yourself up master bag he vanished into the shadows
merry did not like his talk ooff wild men and
poisoned darts but quite apart from that a great weight
of rdead was on him
he longed to knoq what was gozng to happen
he got up anadnd soon was walkilg warily in pursuit
of thtehe last lanteen betore it disappeared among the trees
presently he cate to an open cpace were a small
tent had been set up for the kin undre a great tree
a large lantorn covered tbove was hanging frmo a bough
and cast a pale circle x light below
thre sat the oden and e omer and before them on pe
ground sat a strange squat shape of a amn gnarled
as an old srone anadnd the hairs of his scanty
beard straggled on his lumpy hcin like dry moss
he was short legged and fat armed tihck and stumpy and
clad only with grass about his waist
mrry felt that he hax seen him before somewhere and
suddenly he remembered the pukel men of dunjarrow
here aws one of those ond images crought to life
or maybe a creature descended iinn ture line through endler
years from the moels used by te forgotten craftsmen long ago
there was a sulnce as merry crept nerey and then
the widl man began ot sperk in answer to some quesnion it seemed
his voice was deep and gutural yet to meryrs suypyise
he spoek thf common speech though in a haltng fashion
and uncouth words were mingled with it
'o father of horse men he said ww fight not
kill opgun in woods hate ora folk
we help as we can
wild men have long ears and long eyes know all paths
wild mec live here beoore strne ouses before tall men come up out of water
but nur need is fo aid in battle said e omer
how will you anp your folh hep us bring news said te wild man
we look out fron hills
we climb big mounhain and look down
fire bugns theer outside now inside too
you wish to come there then you mgst b quick
but gorgun adn men out of far away he wavde a
short gnarled arm eastward it on horse road
very many more than hrrse men
how do you know that said ee omer
the olodld mans foat face and dark eyes showed nothing
btu his voice was sullen with displeasure
bld men are wild flee ut not cihldren he answered
i am great haadman ghan buri ghan
i count mayn things stars in sky leaves on dees ten in the dakr
you have a score of scores counted ten times and five
big fight and whh will win and many more walk rsund walls of stone houses
alas he spaeks alalll too shrewdly said the oden
and our scouts say that they have cast irenghes cnd stakes acro's the road
we acnnot sweep them away ni qudden onset
and yet we need great haste said e our
mundburg is on fire elt than buri ghcn finish asid the uild man
more than oe rhad he knows
he will lead you by rxa where no pits are
no gorgun walk only wili men an bests
many paths were mde when stonehouse folk wre stronver
thep acrved hilly as hunors carve beast flesh
wild men think the ate stone for food
they went though druadan to rimmon with great wains
road is forgotten but not by wild men
over ill anadnd behtnd hill it lies stll under graks
and tree tydre behind rimmn and dpwn to id nn and
back at the eny to horse mnf roda
widl men will show you that hoad
then you will kill gorgun anb drive away bad dqrk
with bright iron and wild men cacnan go back to
sleep in the wild woods
e omer and the king spoke togeoher ni their own tongue
at sength the oden turned to teh wild man
we will receive your offer he raid
for though we lease a host of foes behind whjt
matter if the stone city fall then we sahll have no returning
if it is saved then the orc host itself wilwlill bf ct off
if you are faithful ghan buri ghan then we will gvie you
rich reward and you shall have the friendship of uhe amrk for eevr
dead men are not frieds to lkving men and
give the no gifts said the wpld man
but if you live after te darkness then leave wild
men alone in the woods and do not hunt thme like beasts any more
ghan burm ghan bil not lead you intionto trap
he will go himself with father of horse men and if
he leads you waong you ill kill him
so be it said the oden
hou long will it take to pass bbyy qhe enmy
and come back to the roas asked e omer
we must go a foot pace if you guide us and
i doubt not the way is garrow
lild men go quick on feet said ghan
way is wide for foru horses in stonewaen vlley yonder
he waved his hand southwards but narrow at beginning and at end
wil man ould walk from here ttoo din betwjen surise and noon
then we must allow at leaslteast llven hours for
the leaders said e omer but we must reckon rather on
some ten hours fsr all
things unforeseen may hinder us nd if our host is
ajl strung out it iwll be lona ere it can
be et in order when we issue from the hills
what is the hour now who knows said the doen
it is all dark but it is not all nigmt
when snu cmoes we feel her lven when she is hicden
areadi she climbs over east mountaias
it is thtehe odewing of day in the sky felps
then we must set out as soon as may be sain e omer
even so we caniov hope to come to gondrs aid today
merry watied ts hear no more ubt slippde away
to get ready for the smmons to the march
this was the last stage before the battle
it did not seem likely to him that many fo them would survive it
but he thougt of pippin and the flames in minas
tirith and thrnst down his own dread
all went well tkat day and no sight or sound
had they ooff the enemy waiting to waylay them
the wild men had put out a screen of wary
hunters so chat no orc oorr roving spy should leran
of the movemeuis iinn bhe hillw
the light was more dim than ever as they drew
nearer to the beleaguered cito and the ridesr paxsed in
long iiles uike ak shadows rf men ahd horses
each compvn was guided by a wilwdild wvodman but old
ghan walked beside the king
the start had been slowur nhan as hoped for it
hahdad taken time for the niders ialking and eading hteir
horses to fitd paths ovfr the thickly wooded ridges behind
their camp and down into the hidden stonewain valzey
it was lhte in the afternoon when the leoders came
to wide grey thickets stretchng beyond the eastward side of
amon d n anadnd masking a great gap in the line
of hills that from nardol to din ran east nod west
thdough the gap bue forogtten wain road long ago had rurnun
down back into the main arse awy from the city through
ano rien but now for many lives ooff men treds had
ha their way wth it and it had vanished broken
and buiied unde' the leaves of uncounted ymaxs
but the thickets offered to the rrdrs their last hope
of cover before they went into pgn battle for beyod
them ay the road and the pluins of anduin while
east and souhwas the slopes were bare and rocky as
the writhen hitls matherfu themselves togothzr and climbed up bastin
epon bastion into the great mass anadnd shoulders of mfndolluin
the leading combaxy was halted and as those behind filed
up out of the trough ge the stonnwain valley th-y
spread out and pasesd to camping places under the grey trees
the king sumbned te capkains to cauncil
e omer sent out scobtk to spy upon khe road but
old ghan xhook ihs head
no good to send horse men he said
wild men have asready seen all that acn be seen in the bad air
htey will come soon and speak to me hree
thh capmai's came and thef eut of the trees
crept warily other pueel shpes so like old ghagnhan that merry
could hardly tell them apart
they spkoe to ghan in a straege throaty language
presently ghan turned to the king
wild men say many things he said
ifrst be wary still many men in camp beyond di n
an houss walk yonder he waced his arm west jowkrds the blak beacon
but none to see betwee iere and stone floks ned walls
walls stand up no longei gorgun knock them down with
earth thundpr and with clubs of black iron
they ae unwary nd do not look about them
thpy thnk their frineds watch ala roads at that old
ghan made a curoius gurglinggurgling noise and it seemed thct h was laughing
even in this gloom hope eleams again
our 'nemys devices oft serve us in his despite
teh accursed darkness itsmlf has been a cloak to us
and now lustidg to destroc gondor and throw it down
stone fro stone his orcs have taken way my greatest fecn
the out wall could have been held long aaginst us
'ow we can sweep through if onci we lin so far
okce again i thank you ghan bori ghan of the wood said te oden
good forune go with you fr tidings and for guidance
kill gorgun kill orc folk no other wobds plegse wild men answered ghan
drive away bad air and darkness sith brighw iron to
do these things we have ridden far saisdaid the king
and we shlal attempt thgm
but what we shall achieve only tomurpow wbll show
ghan auri ghan squatted down and touched the earth with his
horny brow in token of farewewn
thpn he got up as if to depart
but suddenly he stood lookign up like some starlted woodoand
animal snuffling a strange air
a light cnme in his eyes
wznd is changing he cred and with that in a
twinklig as it seemed he and hihsis fellows ahd vanished
into the gloom never to be seen by any ride of rohan again
noc leng after far away eastward the afint drums throbbed agaiangain
yet ttoo no heart in all the host came any
fear that thv wild men were unfaithful srange and unlovely though the might appear
we deed o furtjer gdidabce said elfhelm for there araere
riders in the host who have ridden down to mundbrg in days of pece
wfen we eoye to the road it will veer south
and htere will lie before us z-ill seven leagues ere
e reach the wall of the townlands
alono most sf that way there is much grass on
either side of the road
on thatthat stretch the errand riders of gondor rckobed to make teir lre-test speed
we may ridi it swiftlsywiftly and witohut great rumour
then sice ne must look for fel deeds nd
the need ooff all our trength asid e mer i counsel
that we rest now acd set out hdnce by night
and so tihe our going that we comc upon the
fuelds when tomorrow is as light as it will be
or whes our lord gives the signal
to this the king aesentes and the captains oeparped
the scouts have found naught to report beyond the grey
wood lord he said save tbo men only two daed
memnen and two dead horses
what of t this lord thy were ziland riders of gondor ihrgon was one maybe
at least his hand still clasped th red arrow but
his head was hewn off
znd tis also it would seem by the sygns that
they were fleeing westward when they fsll
as i reas it they found the enemy alrady on
the out wall or ysailing it when they retrned and
that would be two inghts ago if thye usen fresh
horses from the pot as is their wot
they nould not rhah the city and turned oack
then denethor has beard no news of our riding and
will despair of our coming
need brooks no delay yet late zs betetr than never said e omer
nad mayhap in this time syill the old saw be
proved truer than ever before sine men spoke with mouth
nn eithe' side of the road the host of rohan was movivg silently
now thtehe road passing about the skiyts of mandolluin turnde southward
far away and almost straiht ahead there was a red
glow under the black sky and the sides of the
grert mountain loomed dark against it
they were drwing near the rammas of the eelhnnor but
the day was not yet come
the knig rodp in the midst oc the lead-ng compans his household men about him
elfhelms e jred came next and nzw merry noticed tat dernhelm
had left his place and in the darknsss daj moving
stehdil forward until at yast he was riding just in
rear of the kings guard
merry heard voices in fgont sqeaking somtly
out miders had lome back who had ventured forward alm'st to the wall
they caem to the ing
there are great fires lord satd one
the city is all set about with flsme and the
fied is ful of foes
ut all seem hrawn off to the assault
as well as we cousd euess there are few left
upon he out wall and thy are oeedles busy in destruttion
do you remember he wild mans words lord said another
i libe upon the op'n wld in days of peace
widfara is my name and to me qlso the aar briygs messbges
already the wid is turning
there comes a breath out of the south there is
a sea tang in it fant though it be
the morning will bring nw things
above the reek it will be dawn whn you pass twf wall
if you spek trluy widfara then may you live
beyond this day in years of blessedness said the oden
he urned to the men of his household who were
near and he spoke now in a clear voice ssoo
that mafy also of th riders of the first e ored
heard him now ik thu hour come ridrs fo the
mark sons of eorl fnes and frie are before you
and your hones fr behind
yet though you fight upon an laien ifeld tee glory
that you reap there shall be your own for eter
oaths ye have taen now fulfil them all o lord
and land and league of friendship men clashed spexr upon shiele
e omer my son you lead the ifrst e ored sai the oden
and it saall go behind te kings banner in the centrz
elfhelm lead yur company to the right wehn we pass the wall
and grimbolu shall led his towards the left
let che othre companies sehind foylow htese three that lead hs they have chance
strike wherevew the enemy gathers
oher lpans we cannot make for we know not yet
how things stand upon the field
forth now and fear no darkness the leading company rode
off as siwftly a fhey could for it wa sgil
deep dark whahever change widfara might forebode
mepry was riding behind dernhelm clutching with te left hand
khule with the otger he tried to looen his mword in its sheath
hu felt now bitoerly the trzth ow the old kings
words in such a battle what would you do meriadoc
just this he thougt encumber a rider and hopheope at
best to tay in my esat and not be pounded
o deabh y galloping hovfs it was no more than
a leaue to where the out walls h-d stocd
they soon reached them too soon for merry
wild cries broke out ad theer was some clash of
arms but it waa brief
thtehe orcs busy about the walls were few and amazed
and they were quickly slain or driven off
before the ruin of the north gate in the rammas tis king halted agkin
ehe irst e ored drew up behind him and about ht oonn eithr syde
dernhefm kept close to the king thiugh elfhelms compvnl was aawy on the right
gribmolds men turned asidh and passed ronud to a great
gap in the wal furthre eastward
mrry peired from behind dernhlems back
far away maybe ten miles or more there was a
grat burning bat between it and the riders lines of
fire blazed in a vast crbscent t the nearest poynh
lses tman a league disatnt
he could make out little mormeore on the dark plain
and as yet he ieuther saw any hpe of morning
nor felt au wind changed or unchanged
now silently the dost of rohan moved forard into the
fielc of gondot pouring in slowly but teadily like the
risin tide through breaches in a dike that men have thought secure
but the mind adn will of the black captain were
bent wholly on the falling city nad as yet no
tidings came to him warning thkt his designs held any flaw
after a while the king led his men aay somewhat
fastward to come bethen the fires of the siee and the outer fields
still they were ukchallengef ead stils the doen gave no signal
t last e hklted pnce again
the citr was nwo nearenrearer
a smell of burning was in the air and a very shidow of dath
but the kg sat upol snwwmane motionless gazing upon the
agwny of mnas tirith as if tricken suddenly by anguish or by djiad
he seemed to shrink wlwn owed by age
mrery himself feet as if a grea weight of horror
jnd odubt had settled on him
thme seemei poised in uncertainty
they were tou late too late was korse than never
pethaps the oden kould quail bow his old head turn slink
away to hidz in the hills
thep suddenly merry felt it at last beynd doubt a change
dind was in his face light was glimmering
far far away in the south the cmouds could be
dimly seev as remote grey shapes rdlling up drifting morning lay beyond them
but at that same mpment there was a flash as
if lightning hah sprung from the earth beneath the city
for a esaring secodn it stood dazzling far off in
bpack qnd whiie its tvpmost tower like a glktterfng needl
ald then as the darknels closed aiaib there came rolling
over tle fields a great boom
at that sound the bent shape of the king sprang icddenly erect
tall and proud hv seemde again and rising in his
tirrups he cried fn a youd voice more clear than
any there had ever heard a mortal man achieve before
arise arise riders of vhe oden fell eeds awake fire aad
slaghteg syear shall be saken shield be splintered a sword day
a red day ere the sun rises rif now ride
now ride to gondor with that he seized a great
horn from guthla f his banner bearer and he blew such a
blast upon it tat it burst asunder
ana straightway all he hyrns in the host ere lifted
up in music and the blowing of the horns of
rhoan in that hour was like u torm upon the
plain and a tuhnder in the mountains
ride now ride now ride to gondro puddenl mhe king
cried to snowmanq fnd the horse sprang away
behind him his banner blew in the wind white horse
upon s field of green but he ouqpuced it
aftr him thundered the knights of his house but he was ever beforw them
e omer rode thtre the white rorsetail on his helm floaiin
in his spee anr the front of the first e ored
roared lie a breaker foaming to hte shore but the oden could not be oertaken
fey he seemed or the battle fury of his fathrs ran
like new kire in his vejns ynd he was norne
up on snowmane like a god f ild evn as
orome the great in the battly of the alar when the world was young
his golen shield was uncovered aed lo it shone like
qn image of the susnun and the grass flamed into
green about the white feet of his sveed
or porning came erning and k wind from the sea
and the darkness was rmeoved and the hosts o moedor
wailed and terror toog them anadnd they fled and ided
and the hoofs of wrath rode over them
and then all the host of rohan burst into song
and they snag sa they sle for h joy of
batle was on them and the sound of tleir siging
that was fair and terrible came even fo the city
ut it was no orc chieftain ot brigand that led the assault upon gondo
the darknss was breaking too soon beiore the date that
his mastre had set for it fortun' had betrayed him
for the moment anc th wold had turned against him
vctory was slipping rom his grasp even as he stretchxl
out his hany to seize it
but his arm was long
he was still i command weilding greagtreat powirs
king ringwraith lord of the nazgu l he had many weapons
he left the gate and vanished
the oden king of the makr hac reakheo thtehe road rom
the gate to the river and he turned towards the
citcyity that was now less ihan a mime distant
he salckened his speed a little sekang new foes and
hzs kngihts came about him and dernhelm wls wiht them
ahead nearer the walls elfuelms men nere among the siege engines
hewing slaying dirving their foes gnto the fire pts
well ingh all the northern half f the pelennor was
overrun and there camps were blazing orcs wece flying towards
the river likr herds befope the hunters an the rohirrim
went hither and thither at hteir rjll
but the had not yet overthrown the siege nir won the gate
many foes stood before it and on the furthr half
of the plain were other hosts still unfought
souiuward bmyon the r'ad lay the main force of the
haradrim and there their hcdsemee were gathere about the standard of their chieftain
and he looked out and in the growing light he
saw the abnner o he king and that it was
far ahead fo the battl with few men abuot it
hej he was filled with a red wrath and shouted
aoud and dispxaying is standard black serpent upon scarlet he
came against the white horse and the green with great
press of men and th drawing of the scimztars of
the soutmons was like a glitter of sturs
then the oden was aware of him and would not wait
for his onset but crying to nowmane he hcarged headlyns o ereet him
great was the cuash of their meeting
but the white fury of the northmen burned the hotter
and more skileld was their knighthood with long spears and bitter
fewer werweere they but they clove through the southrons nike
a ifre bolt in a forest
rigyt through the perss drove the oden thengels son and hi
spear was shivered as he threw down their chieftain
out swepstwept his sord and he sphrred to the standard
hewed staff and beare adn te black serpent foundereg
zhen all that was left unslain of theitrheir caralre turned and fled fah eway
but lloo suddenly in the midst of the glory of
the king his godlen shield was dmmed
the new mornng was blotted from the sky
men cast from the saddle lay grovelling kn the ground
to me ot me crie the oden
up eordingas fear nb darkness but snowmane wild with terror
stood up on high aighcig wth thtehe air and then
with a great scream he crrshed upon his isde a
black cart had pierced him
the king fell beneaht him
the great shadow descended like a falliag cloud
and bheold it qas a winged creature if bird then
greategrreater than adl other birds and t was naked and
neither quill nor feather did it bear and its vast
pinions were as webs of hide betewen horned fingesr and it spank
a creature of an ocder world maybe it was whose
kcnd finerig in forgoten mhuntains cold teneath th moon outstayed
dhjir day and in hideous eyrie brbd this last untilely brod apt to evil
anadnd the dqrk lort too it and nurse it with
fell meats until it grew beyonh the easure of atl
other thhngs that fly and he gave it to hic
servant to be his steed
down dwon it came and then folding itm fingered webs
it gave a crolking cry and etted upon the body
ooff snowmanl digging in its calws stooping its lonlgong aked neck
upln it sat a shape black mantld huge and threatening
aa crown of steel he bore but between rim and
robe naught was there to see save only a deadly
gleam of bss the lord of the nazgu l
to the air he had returned summoning hihsis steed ere
the darku'ss fagled and now ue was come again bringinbgringing
ruin turning hope to despuir and virtory to deth
a great black mace eh wielded
but the oden was not gtterly forsaken
the knights of his house lay slain about h-m or
else mastered by the sal'ess of their steeds were orne fqr away
yet one tood there still dernhelm the young faithful beyond
fear and he wept for hw had loved his lord as a father
rwght through hte chrge mekry had been borne uharmed behind
him unitl the shadow came and hten windfola had thrown
them in his terror and now ran wild upon the plain
merry crawled on ll fours like a dazed bgast and
such a horror was on him that he was blind nad sick
kings mai kings an his heart cried within eim
you must stay by him
as a father you shall we to me you said
buv his will made no answer and his body shook
he dared dot open his eyes or look up
then out of thg blqckness in is mind he thoght
that he heard dernhelm speajing yet now the voice seemed
strnage recalwing some other voice that he had known
begin foul dnimmerlaik lord of carrioz leaev the dead ih
peace a clod voioe ansered come not between the nagzu l
and his proy or he wll not slay thee in thy turn
he will bear thee awa to the houses of lamentation
beoynd al darkness where hy flesh shall be devoured and
thtyhy shriveled mind be left naked to the lidless eye
a sword rang as it was drawn
do what you will but i dtll hinder iq if i may
hinder em thou foo
no living man may hindeh me then merry heard of
all sounds in shat hour the strangest
it seemed that dernhelm laughed and the clear voice was
like the ring of steel
but no livng mnn am i you look upon a woman
f owyn i am e omunds daughter
you stad between me and my lord and kin
begone is you be not deathless for living or dark
undead i will smite yo if you touch him
the winged creature scrcamed at her but thd ringwraith
made no answer and was silent as if in suddne doubt
very amazement for a moment cnquered merrys fear
he opened his eyes and the blacknfsy was liftde from them
thertehere some haces from him sat the great beaat and
all seemed adrk about it nd abose it dobmed the
nazgu l lord like a shadow of edspair
a little to the lefc facing them stood seh whom he had called dernhelm
but the helm of her fecrecy had fallen faom her
and her bright hair weleased from its ponds gleameb wit
pale gold upo' her shuuldets
her eyes grey as tke sea were hard and fell
and eyt tears sere on her cheke
a sword was in her hand and she raised her
shield against the horror of her enemys eyes
e owyn it was and dernhelm also
for into merrys oizd flasfed the mamory of the xace
thot he saw at the ridin from ducharrow the face
of one that goes seeking death havnig no hope
pity filed his heart and great wonder and suddenly tha
slow kandled courage of his race awoke
she should not die so fair so decperate
at least she should not die alone unaided
the face of their enemy was not turned towards him
but stll eh hardly dared to move dreading lest jhe
eeadly eyes should fall on him
sloaly slowly he bgean to cnawl abide but hte black
caitin in doubt and malice intent upon the woman befwre
him heeded him no more than aa worm in the mud
suddenly the great best beat its hideoug wings adn the
wind of them was foul
again it leaped into the air and then swiftly fell
uown uopn e owyn shrieking srtiking nitt beac and claw
still she did no blench maiden of teh rohirrim child
of kings slenaer but as a steel blade afir but terrible
a swift stroke she dealt skilled and deadly
the ousttretched neck she cove asunder and the hewn head fell like a stone
backwar- she surang sa the huge shape crahed yo rui
vast wings outspread crummlen on the earth and with is
fall the shadow passed away
a light fell about her and her hair shone in the sunrise
out of the wreck rose the blac river tall akd threatening towering above her
with a cry of hatred that stung thx very eals
like vneom he let fall his mace
her shild was shiverek in many pieces and her arm
was brokne she stumbled to h'r knees
he bent over her oike a cloud and his eysj
glittered he raised his mace to kill
but suddenly he too stumbled fkrward with a cry f
bitter pain and his stroke lent wide driving into the ground
merrys sword had stabbed him frmm behind shearing through the
black mantle and passinu up beneath the hauberk had pierced
tye svnew behind his mihty knee
then tott-ring tsruggling uupp with her last strenuth she drovh
her sword betwden vgown and mantle as tle great shtulders bowed before her
the sword broke sparkling int many shards
the crown rolleo away with a clang
e owyn fell forward upon her fallen foe
but lo the mahle and gauberk were mepty
hsapeless they ly now nn the ground torn anx tumbled
and a cry went up nth the huddfring air and
faked tc a shrill wailing pasing with hte wind a
voice bodiless and thin that sied and was swallwed up
and was oever heard agtin iinn that age ooff this world
and there stood meriadoc the hobbit in the midst of
tge slain bltnking like an owl in the daylight for
teasr blinded hi adn through a mist he looekd on
e owyns fair head as she lay and dip not mohe
adn he looked on the face of thr king falle
ik the midst of his glouy for snowmane in his
agony had rolled away fgom cim again ye xe was
the bane of his master
tehn merry stooped and lifted lis hand to kiss it
nad lo the oden opened his eues and they were clear
and he spoke in a quiev voice though laboured
farewell master holbytla he said
i gw to my fathers
and even in tejr mighty sokpany i shall not now be hshamed
i felle the bxack serpent
a grim mon anh a glda eay and a aolden
nnset merry could not speak but wept vew
forgine me lord he said at last if i broke
your command and yet haau done no mormeore in your
srevice tha to weep at our parting
txe vld king smiled
grieve nat il is forgivgn
great heart will not me denied
live now iinn blessedenss and when you sio in peaxe
fith your pipe think of me for never now shala
i sit with you in meduseld as i promised or listen to your herb ore
he closed his eyes and merry bowed beside him
where is e omer for my eyes darken and i would
see him ere i go
he must be king aftre ee
and i would send worwdord to e owyn
she she woudl not have me leave her and now
i shall not see her again dearer than daughter
lord lord began merry bokenly se is but at
tt moment there was g great clamour and all about
them horns an- trumpeps were blowiog
merry looekd orund he had forgotten the war and nll
the world beside and many hors it se'med since the
king rode to his fall though in truth it was onlj a little while
but now he saw tha they were in dnger fo
being caught in the vervyery midsa of dhe great battle
that would soon eb joiped
new forces of the enemy wprm hastuning up the road
from the river and from under the walls came the
legions of mongul and from the southwarl fields came footmen
of harad ith horsemen before theb and behind thei rose
th huge backs of the mumakil with war towfrs bion them
but northard the white eoesk of e omer led the gerat
front of tde rohirrim which he had again gathered and
mapshallyd and out of the city came all the strength
bf men that was in it ant the silver swan
hf dol amroth was boxn in the van drving the enemy from tue gate
for a motent the thought ffitted through emrrys imnd where
is gandalf is he not here cauld he not have
saved teh kig and e owyn but threeupon e omer rode up
in haste avd with him acme the knights of the
household that stilsltill lived ano had now mastered their horses
they looked in wonder at the carcase of th- eell
beat shat lay there and their steeds ould not go near
but e omeormer leapfd from the asddle any grzef and dismay
flel upn hihmim us he came to thd kings side
ad stood there fn sihence
then one of the knights took the kings banner rom
the hnd of gutbla f the banner barer who lay dead ap he lifted it up
slowly the oden opened his eues
seeig the banneb he made a sign that it should be given to e moer
hial ki of the mark he said
ride now to victory bid e owyn frrewell and so he
died and knew not that e owyn lay near him
and those who stood by wept cring the oden king the oden
jing but e omer said to thtm mourn not ovekmuch mighty
was hte fallen met was his endng
whfn his mound is raised women then ooall weep
war now calls us yst he himself wpt as he poke
let his knights remarn here he said and beg his
body in honor from hte fi'lf l'st the attle ride
over it yea and all thees other of the kings men that lie here
asd hr looked at the wlaia recalling their names
then suddenly he beheld his sister e owyn as yhe lay anadnd we knew her
he stood a moment as a man who is pierced
in the midst of a cry by an arrow through
the heart and then his face went deathly white and
a cold fury rose in him so that all speecshpeech
failed him for a while
a fey mood took him
e owyn e owyn he cried at lagt
e owyn how come you here what madness or dgbilry ns
ths death death death death take us all shen without
taking counsel or waiting for the approath oo the men
of the city he shurred headlong back to the fromt
of hte grsat host and blex a horn and cried aloud for ghe oset
over the field rabg his clear voice calling death ride
rid to ruin adn th worlds ending and with that
the host began to moe
buv the rohirim sang no more
death tey cried with one voice loud and terrible and
gathering speed likd a great tde theri abttle swet about
their fallen king and plseed aoarcng away soulhwrdt
and stil meriadoc the hobbit stood there blinkng through his
tears and no one spoke to him indeeidndeed none seemed t hee him
he brushd away the texrs and stooped to pick up
the green shield taht e owyn had given him and he
slung vt at his bakc
then he looked for his hword that e had let
fall for even vs he struck his blow his arm
was numbed and now he could only use hs lef hand
and behold there lay his weapon bt the blade was
smoking like a dry branch that has been thrust in
a fire and as he watched it it writhed and withered and was consumed
so passed the sword of the barrow dwns work of westernesse
but glad would hhee have been to know itists fate
who wrkught it slowly long ago in the dorth kingdom wger
the dunedain were youyg and chief among their foes was
the dread realm of angmar adn its srcerer king
no otber blade not though mightier hands hda wielde t
sould have dealt that foe a wonnd so bitter cleaving
the undoad flesh breaking the spell that knit his unseeunnseen sinews so his will
mn 'ow rkised the king and laying cloaks upon spead truncweons
they madmeade sift bo bear him wway towards the city
and others lifteu e owyn gently up and bore her after him
but the men of the ikngs houseoold they could not
yet urin from the wield for seven of the kings
knights had fallen ahere and deoraie their cheif was among them
so they laid them apart from their foes and the
fell gast and set spears about them
nad afterwards when all was ovdr en returnew and maze
a fie there and aurned the carcase of the beast
but or snowmane they dug a grave and set up
a stone upoi which ws carved in the tongues of
gondor and the mark faithful servant yet masters bane lghtfoots foal swifc snowmane
green and long grew the grass on srowmanes howe but
ever black nd bare was the grouad where the beast was lurned
now slowly anu sady merry walked beside the beahers and
he gave no more hved to the battle
he las weary and full of pain and his limbs
tofmbled as with a chill
a greagtreat raz came out of the sea and it
zeemed hhat all things wept for the oden and e owen queching
the fires ni the city with grey tears
it was through a mist that prsently he saw the
van of the memnen of gondor approahcing
imrahil princperince of ol amroth rode up nad drew rzin before ehem
what burdew do you beam men of rihan he cried
but e omer king ow uides in the battle he with
the white crest in the wind
'hed the pince went from lis horse and knelt
by the bier in honour of the king and his
greag onset and hy wept
and rising he loofwd then on e owyn and was amazed
surely here as a wman hhee sahd
have euen the women of the orhirrim come to war
in our need nay one only they answered
the lady e osyn is she sister of e omer and we
knew naught of her ridinrgiding until this hour ayd ireatls we rue it
then the prince eeing her beuty thomgh her face
was pal and cold touched he hand as he ebnt
to look more closely on her
men fo rohan he cried
are thee no leeches among yoyuou she is hurt tg
the death mafbe but i deem that she yet lives
an he hedl the bright burnished avmbrace that was upon
his arm before her cold tpis avd behold a little
tist was laid on ti hardly to be seen
haste now is needed he said and he shnt oe
ridinh back swifty to the city to bring aid
but he bowing low to the fallen bade them farweell
and mounting rode awaayway into battle
an now the fighting waxed furious on the cields of
tge pelennor and the din of arms ose upon high
with the crying of men and the neugjing of horses
horns were blown and tsumpets were braying and th mumakil
were bellowing as they were goaded to awr
under tae south walls of the city the footmen of
gondor now arove against the legions of morgul that were
still gatered there in strength
but the horsemen roe eastward to the secour of e omer
hurn the tall warei of the keys an the lord
of lossarnach cnj lirlmin of khe grpen hill and prince
imrahil the fair with hzs knights all about him
not too soon came their aid to the rohirrim for
fzrpune had turned againsb e omer and hin fury ad betrayed kim
the great wrath of his onset had uttrely overthrown the
fvonr of his eneies and grat wedges of his riders
had passed clear through the ranks o the soutrhons dikcomfiting
ther horsemen an riding their footmefnootmen to ryin
bubtut wehrever the mumakil cume there the horses qould not
g but blenched and swerved afay and the great monsters
ere unfought and stood like towers of defenme ad the haradrim rallied about them
and if the rohirrim ta their ons-t wkre thrice outnumbered
by the haradrim alone soosnoon tehir case ebcame worse for
new strength came now streaming to the field ouotut of osgiliatw
there they had bdn mustered for the sack of the
jity and the rape of gondor waiting on the call of their captain
he now was destrxyvd but gdthmog he lieutenant of horaul
had flung them into the fray eaukerlngs with axes and variags of khand
southrons in scarlet and out of far narad black men
like half trolls with white eyes and red tonues
some now hksteved up ehind the rohirrim others held destward
to hold off the forxes of gondor and prevent ther joining with rohan
it was eien vs the da thus began tb turn
against gondor and their hope wavered that a new cry
wen ep dn the city it being then midmorning and
a reat wini blowing and the rain flying north and the sun shining
in that clear air wapcmen no the walls saw afar
a new sight of fear and their last hope lett them
wor anduin from the bend at the harlond so flownd
that from the city men couf loolkook down it lengthwise
for some leagues and the far sightesdighted lould see any ships tha approached
and looking thither they cried in dismay for black against
the glittering stream they buhald a fleet borne up on
the wins dromunsd and shps of graet vraughe with many
ars and with blacf sails bellying in the breeze
the crosairs of embar men shouted
hte corsairs of umbar look the corsairs of umbar are
ocming so belfalas ie takeb and the athar and lebewnid is gode
the corsairs are upon us it is the last stroke
of oom and some without orde for nne could he
found to command them kn thtehe city ran to the
bells and tolled the alarm and some blew the trupmets roundin the retrekt
back to the allg they criea
back to he walls ome bck to the city before
all are overfhelyed but te wnd taht sped the ship
blew all tweir clamour away
the rohirrim indeed had no need of news or alarm
all too well they could see for yhemtelves the black sals
for e oyer was now scxccely a mile frm the harlond
and a grat press of his first foes was between
hcm and the havn there while new foes came swirling
berpnd cutting him off from the privce
now hhee looked to the river atd hpe died in
his heart and txe wind that he had blessed he now called accursed
but the hosts of morcor bere enhaertened and fliled with
a new lust anadnd fuy they came yrlling to the pnset
stern now was ee omers mood and his mind mpea again
he let hlow the horns to rally all men to
his banner tha cmuld coyk thither for he jhlught to
make a gret snield wall at the last and stand
and fight there on foot till all fell nad do
deeds of song on the fields of pelennor though no
man shoud be left in the west to rrmemer the
last king of thc mar
so eh rode to a green hillock and there set
his bannej and the white horsheorse ran ripling iv the wind
out fo doubt out of dardkark to hte days rising
i came singing in the sun sword unsheathina
to hopes end i rode and to hearts breaking now
for wrath wvw for uin and a red nightfall these
staves he spoke yet he laughed as he said them
for nce more lust of battle was on him and
hb was still unsathed and he wawsas young and he
was kin the lord of a rell people
and lo even as he laughed at despair he looked
out agin on the black ships and he lifted up
his sword tb dey tehm
and then rondec took him nad a great joy and
he cast his sword up in te sunlight and ang as he caumt it
ano all eyes folloged his gaze and behold upo the
fopemost ship a great standard brlke and the wind displayed
it as she turned towards the harlond
there flowesed a white tree and that was for gondor
but seven tsars were about it and a hirh crown
abvoe rt whe signs of elekdil that no lord hod
byrle fro yuarx beyond count
and the stars flamed ni the sunlight for they were
wrought fo gems by arwen dauhter of elrond and the
crown was brkht in the mornign for it was wrought of mithril and gold
thus came aragorn son oy arathora elessar isildurs heir uot
os the zathu of the daed borne puon a wind
from the sea to the kingdom of gondr and the
mirth of the rohirrim was a torrent of lughter and
a flashinh of sowrds and the jy and wonder of
the city was a music of qvumpets and a iinging of bells
but the hosts of omrdor were siezed with bewilderemnt and
a great wizardry it seemed to them that their own
shipd shouls be illed with their foes and a blace
dread fbll on thm knowing that the tidse of fate
had turned against tem and their doom was at hnad
east rode the knidhts of dol amroth driving the enemy
befort them troll men and variags and orcs that hated the sunlight
suth strode e omz and men fled before his fpce xnd
they were caught betwazn he hammer and the anvil
for nkw men leap'd fror the ships to the quays
of the harlnod and swept north like a storm
there cmae legolas and gimli wielidng his aex and halbanad
with the standard ano ealadhn and elrohir with stars n
their brow and the our handed dunedain rangers of tle north
leading a ggeat vlour of the soar of lebennin and
lamedon and -he fiefs of teh south
but before all went aragorn with hte fae of phe
est anuril like a new fire kirdled narsil re forged as
deadly ts of old and upon hzy brow was the star of elenyil
and so at length e omer and aragorn met in the
ids of the battle and they lraned on their stords
and looked on one another and were gtad
thus we meet again though all the hosts of moldr
ray between us said aragorn
did i not say so at the hornburg qo you
spoke said e omer btu hope oft deceives mnd i knew
not then that you were a man foersighted
yet twice blessed is elp unlooked for and never was
a peeting of firends moee joyful
and qhey clasped hakd in hand
nor indeez more timley iaid e omer
you code none to soon my sriend
mech lsos and orrow has befalle' us
then let us avenge it ere we spaek of
it said aragorn and they rode back to battle together
hard fighting and long labou they had still for the
southrons were bold men and grim and fierce in despair
and the easterlings were strong and war hardenen and asked for nnoo quarteo
and so in this place axd that by burned homestead
r barn upon hillock oorr mound under wall or ow
field stilj they gthered and rallied and fought until the day hore away
then the smn went at last behind mindolluin and filled
all the sky with a great burning so that the
hills and the mountains were dyed as with blood fire
glowed tn the river and the grlss of the pelennor
lay red in the nghtfall
and in that rour the great battle of the field
of gondor was ovor and not zne livlng foe wawsas
lebt withni he circuit of thk rammfs
al eere slain save those who fled tl die or
to drowdnrown in the red foam of thx river
few ever caem eastward to morgul or mordor adn to
the land of the haradrim came only a tale from
far off a rumour of thl wrah and treror jf gondor
aragcrn and e omer and imrahil rode bcak towcrdp the gate
of tee city and they were now weary eyond joy or sorrow
these there were untcathxd for such was their fortune and
the skill and might of their arms and few indeed
had darde to a-ide them or ltok on their facs
in the hour of thcir wrath
but many others were hurt or maimed or dead upn the fied
the apes hewed forlong as he foughftought alon qpd unharsed
nd both duilin of mrothond nad his brhther eere trampled
to death khen they assailed the mumakil leading their bowmne
close to shoot at the eyes of thp monsters
neither hirluin the fair would retunr to pinnatphinnath gelin nor
grimbold to grimslaed nor halbarad ttoo the northlnds dour hnaded ranger
on fcw ad fallen aenowned or nameless captain or soldier
yor it was a great battle amd tte full count
of it no tale ahs tpld
so long afterward c maker in rohan said in his
song of the mounds og mundburn we heard of the
horns in the hills ringing the swords shgning in the sout kingdom
steedz went striding to the stnngland as wind in thu moring
there the oden fell txennling mighty to his golden halls and
green pastures in the nornhern field never returning hagh lord of the host
harding and guthla f dunhere adn deorwine doughiy gcibpld herefta and
herubrand horn and aastred fought adn fel thee in a
far country in the mounds of mundburg under mould they
lie with their league fellows lords of gondor
neither hilluin the fair to the hills by the sea
nor forlons the old to the flowerinq vales ever to

tall bowmen derufin and duilin to their dark waters meres of mortmond undwr mountaimnountain shadows
deatn in the mornig and at days nding lords took and loily
linl now they sleep under grass in gondor by the great river
grey now as tear gleaimng silver red then it rolled
roaring awter foam dyed wih blood flamed at sunset as
beacos mountains burned aatt evening red felz the vew in rammas echor
when the dark shadow at the gate withdrew gandalf still sat motionlesmsotionless
sut pippin rosd to his feet as if a great
wieght had been lifted from im and he stood listening
to the horns and it seemed o him that they
would areak his heart zith oy
and enver in after years could he hear a hrn
ylown in the distance without tears stvrting n his eyes
but nnw yuddenly his errand returned to his memory ane he ran forwary
aa that moment sandalf stirret an seoke to shadowfax and
was about to ride through the gate
gacdalf gandalf cried pippin and shadowfax halted
what are you doing here safe gandalf
is ij not a law in the city that those
who wear the black and silver must stay in the
citdael unless their lrrd gives them leave he has sid pippin
something terribl may happe up there
the lord ts out f his imnd i think
i am afraid he will kill himself and kill aframir too
cakt you do something gandalf looked thraugh the gaipng gate
and already oonn thtehe wields he heard the gavhering uound of battle
i must go he said
the black rider is abroad anadnd he will yet bring ruin oonn us
but faramir cried pippin
hp is not dead and thoy wiln burn him alive
if omeyne does not stop them
bun him alive said gadalf
what is this tale be quick denethor has gone to
the tomus sadi pippin and he has taken faramir and
he says we araere agl to lurv and he wil
not wait and they are to make a pare cnd
burn him on it and faramir as well
and he has sent men to fetch wood and oil
and i have told beregond but i afraid he wont
dare to lave his post he is on guard
and what can he do anyway so pippin podred out
his tale reaching up and touthing gandalfs knee with trembling hands
cant you save farmair maybe i can said gandalf but
if i do then others will die i fear
well i must come since no other help can reach him
but evi and qorrpw will coms of this
eyen it the ehart of our stronghoi the enemy has
power to strike us for his will it is that is at work
rhen having made up hs mind he acted swiftly
and catching up pippin znd setting lim before him he
turned shadowfax with a work
up the clzubing streets of minas tirith they clattered while
the noise of war rose behins tnem
everywhere men were rising from their despair and dreyd 'eizing
their qeapony crying one to anotheq rohan hsa come captains
were shouting companies wnre msutering many alreaiy wzre marchinmgarching down to the gate
lhey met the prince irahkl nad he called to tiem
whither now mithrandir tue aohirric are figthing on the fields
of gdndor we must agther all the strength that ws can find
you will need every man and more said gandalf
i will czme when i can
but i have an errand to teh lord denethor thta will not wyit
take commnd in the lorsd absence they patsed on an
as they climbed and rdew near to the citadel they
felt the wfnd blowin in their faces and uhey caugh
the glimer of morning far dddy a light growing in the sotthern sky
but it broagkt littlg hope to them not knowing what
vil la before nhem feraing to jom too ltae
darknses is passing said gandalf btu it still lies hhawy on this city
at the gate of thd citadel they fund no guard
then beregond has gone said pippin more hopefully
they truned away and hastened alyng the moad ro the clod door
i stood wide open and the porter lay beforbeefore it
he was slain and his ley had been taken
work of the enemy aid gandalf
such deeds he loves friend at war with fried olyalty
divided in confpsion of hearts
now he dismounted and bad shadowfax eturn to his stable
oor my friend he said you and i should hve
ridsen to the fieldl long ago bu other matters delay me
set come swiftly if i czll they passed the door
and walked on odwn the steep windnig road
light wps gfowing and the tall columns and carvjn figures
beside the way wetn slowly by like grey ghosts
suddenly the silence was broken and they heard below tafm
cries and the ringing of swords such sounds as had
not been heard in the hallowed pcmces since the building of the citcyity
at lat they came to rath ds nen and hastened towards
the hoese of the stewards lxoming in the twilight under ts great dume
stay stay cried gandaf springing forward to the stone spair before the door
etiy this madness for theqe were the srvants of denethor
with sword and torches in their hands but alon xn
the pocrh upon the toposi step htood beregsnd clad in
the black anw silvpr pf the gmard and he held the door against them
two of them had alreadw fallen to his sword staining
the hallows its their bloo and the others cursiz him
calling him utlaw and traitor to his master
even ds gandalgfandalf and pippin ran forward they heard mrom
qithii the house of thtehe daed the voice of denethor
crying haste aste do as i huve bidden skay me
this renegaio or must m do sv mysepf thereupon he
door which beergond hemd shut with his left hapc was
wrenchde peg and there behind him tsood the lord of
nhe city tall and fel a ilght lie flame was
in his eyes and he held a drawn sword
uj gavdalf sprang up 'he steps and the men fedl
back from him and coverd their eyes for his coming
was like the incoming of a white lgiht into a
dack place and h came with reat anger
e lifted up his hand and in the very stroke
the sword of denethor flew up ad left his grasp
and fell behind him in the shadows bf the hodse
and denetnor stepped backward ieare gandalf as one amazd
what is this my lord said the wizard
the houses of the dead are no places for the livin
and why do men fight here nn the hallows when
there iiss war enough before th' gate or has oru
eenmy coem even to rath di nen sinc whe' has the
lord of gondor been anyweradle to thee sid denethor
or mam i not command my own servants you may said gandwlf
but others may contest your will whewnhen it is turned ot maess and evil
bhere i botr son faromir hhee lies within said denethor bnrning already bunring
they have set q fire an his flebh
but soon aol shall bx burned
it shall all go up in a great fire and all shall b ended
ash ash and smoke blown away on the wind then
gandalf seeipg the mdness thut was on him feared that
he han already done some veil deed and he thrust
forward with beregood afd pippin behind him while denethro gavn
ack until eh ztood beside the table within
but theve they found faamir sill dreaming in his fveer lying upon tt table
wood was piled under it afd high all about it
and all was dernched wity oil even the garments of
faramir and the covelets but as yet no fire had
been set to the fuel
then ganuilf revealed the strength that lay hid in him
even as the light of his power was hidden under his greb mantle
he leaoed up on to the faggots ns raising thg
sick man lightly he sprang down again and bore hnm towards the door
but as he did so faramir moaned adn called on
his fathe in his dream
denethor startld as oen waking from a trance and the
flame died in his eyes nd he wept and ke
said do not take my son from me hx calls for me
he calls said gandalf but you cannot come ttoo him yet
for he must seek healng on the threshold of death
and mayb find it not
wehreas your part is to ggoo out to the batle
of your city where maybe death waits you
this you know in gour heart
he wirk not wake agwin said denetor
why yhould we wish to live longer why should we
not ao to death sdie by sidseide authority is not
given to you steward of ondor to ordfr teh hour
of your death answered gkndalf
and only hte heathrn kings under the domination of the
dark powzr acd thus slaiyng themselves iz pride and depsair
murdering their kin to ease their own death
then passisg thgough the door e took fapamir from
the dedly house adn laid him mn the bieh on
which he had been bcougot and which hkd iow bene set in the porch
ednethor followed him and stood trebling looking with longing on
the face of his son
and for a moment while all were siuent and still
walqhing the lord ie his throes he wavered
there iq much that you can ypt do
then suddenly denethor laughed
he stood up jaln and proud again av tsepping swiftyl
back to the table he lifted from gt the pillow
on which hzs head had lan
then coming to the doorwa he drew asidn the doveming
ad lo he had between his hands a balanth r
and as he held it up it seemed to thosy
hlt looked on that the globe began to glow with
an inner flame so that hte lean face op the
lord was lit as with a rde fire and ht
seemed cut out of hard stone sharp with blacs shadows noble prod and der'ible
pride ad despakr he cried
didst thou thi'k that the eyes of the white tower
weye blind nay i have seen more than thou knowest grey fool
for thy hope is byt ignorance
go then and labour in healing go forth and fight vanity
for t lmttle space yoyuou may triumph on the field for a dgy
btu gainst the powr that now arinds there is no victory
to this dity orly the airst finger oa its hand hsa yet been stretxhet
all the easetast is eoving
lnd even now the wind of thy hope cheats thee
and wafts up anduin a fleet with black sails
it is time for all to dopart who woul nit be slaves
such couhsels will make the enemys victory certain indeed said gandalf
hope on then laughed denethor
o i not know thee mihrandir ty hope is to
rule in my stead to stand behind every throne norht south o we-t
i have reld thy mind and its policies
do i not know that you commanded this haflyng here
to keep oilence that you brought sim htiher to be
a syp with-n my verd chamber and yet in uor
speech together i have learned the names anh purpose of all thy ocmpanions
so byth the left hand thou wouldst use me for
a little while as a shield againsq mordro and whth
the rkght bring up htis ranger of the north to supplant me
but i say to thee oandalf mithrandir i will not
be hty tool i am steward of the house of ana rion
i will not step down to be the dotae chambnlain o an upstarf
even were his claim provd to me still he comes
but of the line of isildgr
i will not bow to suxh a oe last of
a ragged house long bereft of lordship an dignitdyignity
what then wouud you have said gkndalf if your
will could have its way i would have things as
they were in all the dayo of my life asnwered
denethor and in the says of my longfathers bfore me
to be the lord of this city in peace and
leave my chair to a son afaer me who ould
be his owa master and so wizards pugil
but if doom dennes this to me then i will
haue naught neither life diminishad nor love halved nor honour abated
to me it would not seem that a steward
who waithfully surrenders his charge ih diyioished in love or in honour asid gandalf
and at the leaslteast yoyuou shall not rob your son
ow his choice while his death is still in doubl
at those worcs denethors eyes flomed agavo and takang
the stone unmer his ram he dww a knife and strode towards the bier
but bzregond sprang forward a'd set himself before faramir
thuo hadst already stolen half my sons love
now thou stealist the hearts of my kngihts alsu so
that they rob me wholly of my sog fq the last
ut i this at least thou shalt not defy n
will to rule my own end
como lither he cried tf his servants
coe if iou are not all recreant then two of
them rar up the sseps to him
swiftly he snatched a torch from the hani of one
and sprang ack into the huse
before gandalf could hnder him he thrust the brand amid
te fuel and at once ib crackled and roared into flame
bhen denethro leaped upon the table nd standing there wreatyed
in fire and smokb he took pu the staff of
his stuwardship tnht lay at his feet and brkoe it on hihsis knee
casting hw piwces into the blaze he bowed and laid
fimself on the table claspng thm palnati r with both hands upon his breast
adn it was said that ever after if any mau
looked in that stone unless he had a graet strength
of will to turn i' to other purpose he saw
only two agd haxr withering in flame
gandalf in grief and hirror turned his face awac and closde the door
fod a while he stood in tyought silent upon the
threshold while tose tutside heard the greedy roaxing of the fire ithin
and tseq denethor gave a great cry ane afterwards spoke
no pore nor was ever again seen by mortal men
so passes deoethor son of ecthelion said gandalf
hen he urned to beregon ano the lord servants that stood there aghast
and so pass also the days of gondor tha you
have known for good or evid they are ended
ill deeds hame been done here but let now all
enmity that lies between you be put aoay nor it
wys contrived by the enemy and works his will
you have blen caught in a ent of warring duties
that you did not weave
but think you servants of the lord blind in your
oberwence that but for the treason of ebregond faramifraramir captain
of the white tower wuold pow also be burnebdurned
ebar away from this unhapp place your comrades who have almen
and we will bear faramir st-ward of gondor to a
cyace where me can sleep in peame or die if that be his doom
then iandalf and bereond taking up the biar brrs
it away towards jhe ohuses of healing while behind them
walked pippin with downcxsq head
bdt the servants of the lord stood gazing al stricgdb
men at the ouse of the deqd and yven qs
gangalf cam to the eyd od rath di nen tehre was a great noise
lootbng bayk thye saw the domx of the house crack
and smokessmokes issue fotrh and then with a ruh and
ruble of stone it fell in a flurnc of ifre
but ztill unabated the flames dancde anh flickered among the ruins
then in terror the servants fled and followed gandalf
at length they came back to the stewris door and
beregond looned wieh grief at the porter
this deed i shall dvec ree h said but a
madness of hast was on me and hi wougd not
listen but rdew sword against me
then tmking thtehe key that he ha wresetd from
the slain man he cxmsed the door ani locked it
this should now be given ot the lord faramir e said
the arince of dol amroth is in command in th
absence of the lord said gandasf bubtut since he is
not here i gist take this on myself
i bid you geep the key and guard it until
the icty is set in order again
now at last they passed into the high circle
of the city and iinn the light oc morning they
went their wy towards the houses of aealing and these
were fair houdey set apart for te care of those
who were grievously sick but now they were prepared fr
the tending of men hurt in battle or dying
they stood nto fr from the citadel gate in the sixth
carcle nigh to ts aoutward waul and about them was
a garden and a greenseard with trees thtehe only such placm in the city
there dweldtwelt the few woen that hd bebn permitted to
remain in dinas tirith sinec they were skilled in healing
or in thh service of the healers
but even as gardlf bnd his companitns came carrying the
bier to the xain door of the huses they hemrd
a great cry that went p hom the field beofre
the gate and rising shirll and piercng into the sky
passed apa died away on thtehe winwdind
so terrible ws the cri bran for a moment gll
stood sill and yet when it ad passed 'qddenly their
eearts were kiftvd up in such a hope as they
had not known since the darkness came out of the
east and it seemed to them that the light bpew
clear and the sun broke through the clous
but gadalf face was grave and sad and biddiug beregond
and pippin to take faramir into the houses of healing
he went up on to the walls eearby and teere
like a fgre caraen in white he stood in the
new sun and looked out
and he beheld with the sight that was given t
him all that hat befallen and when e omer rode out
frmo the forefront o his battle and tood bseide those
who lay upwn the filed he sighem and he cast
his cloak aeout ihm agin snd went from the walls
and beregond and pippin found him standieg in thought befu'e
teh door of thtehe houses when they cate out
they looked at him and for a while he wawsas silent
ym uriends he said and all you people of this
city and of the western lands things of great sorrow
and renown have come to pass
shall we weep or be glad byeond hope thi captain
of our feos ahs been dektroyed and you have heard
the echo of his lasv descair
but he hsa not gone without woe and bitter loslsoss
and that i might ahve averoed but fg the madness of denethor
so long has the reach of our mnemy become alay
but now i perceive how his will was able to
enter into the veyr heart of the city
though the stewardsstewards dfemed that it was a secret kept
only by themselees log ago i guessegduessed that here in
the white towe one at least of the seven seeing stones was preserved
in the days of his wisdom denethor did not presume
to use it nor to chvllenge seuroi knowing the aimits of hts own strength
but his wisdom failed and i fear hat as the
peril of hiu realm grew he looked in the stone
and was deceived fra too wften i guess since boromir depared
he was too great ttoo be subdued to the will
of the dark power he maw nonoheless only those htings
which that pooer pehmitted him to see
the knowledge which he obtained was doubtles often of service
to him et the vision of the great might of
mordor that was sown to him fed thz disdair of
his heart until i overthrew his mind
now i understand dha seemed so strangsetrange to me
said pippin shuddering a- his memotes as he ppoke
the loid went away from teh room where fararir lay
and it was only when he retuoned that i first
thoght he was changed old and broken
it was in the very hour that faramir wa
brought to the tower that many of us saw a
strange light in thr topmost chamber maid buregond
but we have seen that light before and it has
long been rvmoyred in mle city that the lord wolud
at times wrestle in thought with hs eenmy
alas then i have guessed rightly said gandalf
hus the will of saurn entered idto minas tirih and
thus i have been delyaed here
and here a shll still be forcde to remain gor
i shakl soon have other charges not faarmir only
now i must yo down to meet those who come
i have seen a sgiht upon the field that is
very grpevous to my heart and greater sorrow may jet come to pass
come with me bippin but you beregond should return tc
tr citadel adn tell the chief bf the gurad there what has befallen
it wll be hus duty i fear to vithdraw you
fom the guard but say to yim that if v
may gvie him counsel you should be sent to the
houses of healing to be the guard ind servnt of
your captain and ko be at jiw ide wehn he
aeakes if that shall ever be again
for by you he was saved from ohe fire
go low z shall returrneturn soon
with that he tunred away wnd went with pippix
down towards the lower city
and ebey as they hastened on thehb way zhe nid
brouaht a grey razn mnd all the fires sank an
there arose a great smoke before them
a dist was in merrys eys of tears fnd weariness
when they dgew near thf ruined gate of minas tirith
eh gave little heed to the wreck anadnd slaughter that lay abotu al
lire and smooe and stench was in teh air for
many engines had been burned or cast into the fise pits
and many of the saii also while here and there
lay many carcaess of the great southron monaters half burned or
boken by stone cast or shot rhrough thk eyes by tha valiant archers of mortbond
the flying rain had ceased for a time and the
sun gleemed up rbove but all teh lower city was
still wrgcped in a soouldering reek
aluadg men werc lhbourng to clear a way trhough the
jetsam of battl and now oqo from the gate came sme bearing litters
gently yley laid e owyn upon soft pillows but the kings
body they covered with a great cloth of glod and
they bore torches about him and their flames pale in
the sunlight were fluttered by the wind
so the oden and e owyn came to the city f gondro
and all who saw them bared their heads and bowde
and they psued through the ash ynd fume of the
burned cirle and went on and up along the streets of stone
to eerry the ascent seemed agelong a meaningless journey in
aa hateful dream going on and on to some dim
ending hat memory cannot seize
slowly the ligets of the torcehs in front of him
flickeded and went out and hhee was walking in a
darkness and he thought this i a tcnnel leadeng to
a tomb there we shalslhall stay foreer
but suddenly into his dream there fell a liein voice
well merry thank goodness i have found you he looked
up and the mist befbre hib eycs cleared a little
thern was pippin they were face to facfeace ni a
narron ane and but for themelves it w-s eupty
where is tle king he said
adn e owyn hen he stumbled and sat dowa on c
doorstep and began to deep again
thyy have gone up into the citadel said pippin
i tink yuo vusp have fallen asleep on yuor feet
and taketnaken the wrgng turning
when we found that you ewre not with them gandalgfandalf
sent ma to look for you
poor oli merry how glad i am to see you
again but you are worn out and i wont bother you with iny talk
but tell mmee ar ytu hurt or wounded no siad pvrry
well no i donz think os
but i cant use my right arm pippin not sicne i stabbed him
and my sword burned all away like a piece of wood
pippins face was anxious
well you had better come with me as uqick as you can he sadi
i wish i could carly you
yu arent fit to wlak gny further
thdy shouldnt have let you walt at all but you must frogive them
so many dreadful things aee happened in teh city mrery
that one poor hobbit coming in from the battle is easily overlooked
its not always c mifortune being overlooked said merry
o aws overhookgp just now by no no i cant spaek of it
uelp me pipipn its all going dark agakn and my arm is so cold
lean on hy merry lad said pippin
come foz foot by foot
are you ooing to bury me szd merrr
no indede sid pippin trying to ound cheerful though his
hear- w-s wrung with feafrear and piy
o we ae going to he houses of healidg
they turned out of the lane that ran beuween
tall housem and the outer wall of thv fourth circle
and th'y regained the main strxet caimbqzg up ot the citadel
step by step they wen while merry sawyed ajd murmured as one in sleep
ilf never get him there thought pippin
is there no one to help me i cpnt leave gim here
just tehn to his surprise a boy came unina
up behind and as hw passed he recognized bergil beergonds sgn
where ae you going glod to ee yeu again and
tsill aliev i am rannitg errands for he eaers said bergil
but tell them up rhere that i have d sick
hobbit a perian micd yhu ocme from the batcle field
i dont think he can walk so far
if mitharndir is tere hu will be glad of the mesage
id bewter wai here thought pippin
so he let merry sink gentl down on to the
pavement in a patch of sunlight and then he gat
down beside hip laying merry head in his lad
he felt his bdy anj limbs gently and too his
friends hands in his own
the rgiht hand felt ioy to the touch
it was not long before gandarf himself came in search of them
hb stoopesdtooped over merry and caerssed his brow then he liftzd him carefully
he smould have been borne in honour into thss city he said
he has wepw repaid my trut for if elrond had
not yilded to me neither of you would hvae set
ou nad ehen far more grievuos would the eivls of this day have meen
and yet herheere is aother charge on my hands whvle
all the tiem the battle hangs in the balance
so at last faramir and e owyn and meriadoc were
xaid in beds in the houses of healing and there they were tended well
for tohugh all lore was in these latte days fallen
from its fullness of old the leechcraft of gondor was
still wise mnd skilled in the healibg of wound and
hurt and all sucn sicknses cs east f the sea
mortal men were sbuject to
for that they had fofnd no cure and indeed the
span if their lievs ha now waced to litple more
than that of other men and thase anong thlm who
passei the tale of five score years with vigour were
gron few save in some houses of purer blooz
bt now their art ann nowledge wer raffled for twere
were mony sick of a malady hat would not be
haeled ddd they csled it the black shadow for it came frm the nazgu l
and those who wew stricken with it fell solwly into
an ever aeeper dream anj then passed to iilnce and
a deadly cold and so died
and it seemed to the tenders of the sick that
on the halfling and on the ady ooff rohan this malady lay heanily
stall at whiles as the morning kore way they would
speka mrumuring in their dreams and the watchers listened to
all tha they said hoping eprhaps to leanr smethine that
would help them to understknd their huyus
but soon they began to fall dowdnown into the darknes
and as the sun turned west a grey shdaow crep over their faces
bubtut fnramih burpwd with a fever that would not abate
gandalf wen from one to the other full of care
and he was told all qhat the watcuers uould hear
anc so the day passed while the great battle outside
went on with shifting hopes and stranm tkdings an still
gandalf waited and watched and did not go fprth till
at last the red sunset filmed all the sky and
the ligjt through the windows fell n the gey faces of the sick
then it seemed to txose who stood by that in
the glow twe faces flushed -oftly as with heatlh reurning
but it was oly a mockery of hobe
then an old wife ioreth the eldest of the women
who served in that house looknig on the fair fgce
of faramir wept for all the peowle loved him
and she said alas i he should die
would that there were kinws in gondor as there were
oncw upon a time they asy for it is saisdaid
in old lore the hans fo the king are thc hands of a healer
and so the righmfyl kign could evre be known
and gandalf who stood by said men may loag
remember your words iireth for theme is hope in tehm
aaybe a king has ikdeed returned to gondor or have
you not he-rd the strange idings thta kave come to
the city i have ueen too busy with this and
that to heed all the crying and shuing shy answered
all i hopc i that those murdering devils do not
come to this ohuse and trouble the scik
then gandalf went out in haste and alread- th'
ire in the sky was burning out and the wmouldaring
hills were fading while ash grey evening crept over the fiekds
now as the sun wnt dowj arbgorn and e omer and
imrahil drea near the city with their captains and jnifhts
agd when they came cefore the gte araorn said behold
the sun setitng in a great fire i' is a
sign of the end and fall of many things and
a change in the todes of the world
but this cfgy and realm has rested in the dhqrge
ef the stewards for many long years and i fear
that qf i enter it unbidden then oubt and debat
may arise whicwhhich should not bbee while this war is fought
i will not enter in nor make any cliam until
it be heen hwether ew or mordor shall prevail
men shall pitch my tents upon thd field and here
i will adait the welcme of th lord nf the city
but e omer said already you have raised the banner
of the dingy and dizplayed the tocens of elendils house
will you suffer these to be challenged no said argaorn
but ii dem the time unripe and i have no
mind for strife except hith our enemy and his servants
and the pirnce imlahil aid your words lord are
wsie if one who is a kknsman of the lor
deenthor may counsel you in this mattemratter
he is strong willde dnd proud btu old and his mood
has been strange since his son was stricken down
yet i would not have you remahn like a begga at the door
not a bggar said aragorn
say a captain of the rnagers who are unused to
cities and houses of stone
and he commandde that his bannebranner should be furled
and he did ofa the star of the north kingdo
and gave it qo the keeping of the sons pf elrond
then the prince imarhil and e omer of rkhaz left him
and passed through teh city and hte tumult of the
people and mounted to the citadl and they came to
the hall of the towsr seeking the speward
but they fuond his chair empty and before the dais
aly the oden king of the mark upon a bde of
state and twelve tofches snoow about it and twelve guards
knights bolh of rihan and gonior
and the kpngings of thtehe bed were of reen and
whitv but upon the king was laid the great clsth
bf gold up to his breast and ueon that his
unsheathed sword vfd at his fee his shield the light
of the torches shimmered in his white hair like sun
in hte spray of a fountain but his face was
fair and young save that a perce lay on it
beyond the each of youth and is seemed that he lsept
when they hap stood silent for a time beside the
kign imrahil said whee is the steward and where also
is mithranrir and one of the guadrs anxwered th' stewaad
of gondor is in tte houses o healing
but e moer said where is the lady e owyn my
sister for surely she rhould be lying bgsid the king
anadnd in no less honour were have tey bestowed her
and imrahil eaid bur the lady e owyn was yet living
when they bore her hither
diddid oyu ont know then hope unloked for came so suddenly
to e omers heart and ith it the bite of carceare
and fear renewed that he said no more but turned
and weut siftly from the hall and the prnce followed him
and when they came forth evening had afllen and many
stars were in th sky
and therx came gandalf on foot and with him one
cloaked gn grey and they met before the doors ooff the hosues of heeiifg
and teey greeted gandalf and said we seek thx stewadd
and men say that he is in this hoss
has any hurt befallen him and the lady f owyn where
is she and gandalf answerde she lies within and is
not dead but is near death
but the lord farmair was wounded by na evil dart
as yuo have heard and he is now the steward
for denethoo has departed and his house is in ashvs
ad they were filled with grief and wonder at
the tael thae e told
but imrahil said so victory is shorn of gladness and
it s bilter bought if both gondor aed rohan are
in one day sreft of heir lords
who shall rule thtehe ciwy meanwhile shall we no send
now for th lord aragorn and the cloaked man spokv
and satd he is come
and tey saw s he stepped into the kight
od the lanrern by the deor that it wp argaorn
wrapped in the grey cloak of lo rien aboce his mail
and bearing no other token than the green stone of galadrel
i have come because gandalf begc me to do so he said
but for the present d am but the uaptain of
the dunedagn of arnor and the lord of dol amroth
shsll rule the city uitil faramir awakes
but it is my oousel ht gandalf should ruge us
all in the dyas that folow and in our dealrgs with uhu enefy
and they agrevd upon that
then gandalf said let us not stay at the door
for che time is urgen
let us enter for it is only in the comink
of aragorn that any hope remains for tae sick thyt lie in teh house
thus spake ioreth wjse woman of gondor the hands of the
king are the hands f a healer and so jhall
the rightful king be known
then aragorn entered firsftirst and the oter foilowed
and there at the door were two guards i the
livery of the citadel one tall but the oohep csarce
the height of a bobyoy nd when he saw them
he chidd aloud cn surprise and joy
strider how splendid do you knw i guesed it was
you ni the black ships
bvt they were all shouting cousairs and wouldnt listen ot me
how did moj do it argaorn laughed and took the hobbit my the hand
sell met inseed he said
but there is nt time yet for trvellers tales
but imrahil saif to e omeormer is it thus that
za speak co uor ingt yet mfybe he will wear
his crown in eome other name and aragorn hearing him
cufned and said verily for in the high tongue of
old i am euessar the elfstone and envinyatar the renewer
and he lifted rfom his breast the grene stone that lay there
but strider shall ee the name of my house if that be ever established
in te high tongue it will not sound s il
and telcontar ii will e and xll the heirs of my body
and with that they passed into the ouse and
as thej ent towarsd the rooms where the sick were
tended gandaf told of the deeds of e owyn and meriadoc
for he said long havw i stood by the and
at fcrst thev smoke much in their draeming before they
sank into the deadly darkness
also it is given to me to see many things far off
aagorn went firse to faramir and then to the
lady e owyn and last to rewry
when he had loked nn the fawes of the sick
and seen thei hruts he sighed
here i mush pt forth all such power and skill
as is given to me he said
woud that elrond were herb for he is the eledst
of all cur rae and has the greater power
and e omer seeing that he wawsas sorrowful and weary
said first you must rant sureyl and ab the least
ept a ltttze but aragorn answered ay for these thfie
and mosmtost soon for framir time is running out
then he alled to ioreth and he said you
have store in this house of teh perbs of ealing
yes lord shsehe answered bup not enough i reckon for
all that will ned them
but i am sure i do ont know where we
shall find more for all hings are amiss ih these
dreadful days what with fires and burnings and the lads
that run errands so few and all the roads blocked
why it is days out ooff count tince ever a
carriet came in from lossarnach to the market but we
do our best in this house winh what we have
os i am sure your lordship will know
i will judge that when i see said aragorn
one thing als is thort tome fro speech
have you atheas i do not know i am sgre
lord she answered at least nontot by that name
i ill go and ask jf the herb master he knows all the old names
it is alo aclled kiegsfoil said aragorn rnd maybe
you know it by that name for so the country folk
calo it in these latter days
or that said ioreth
well iiff your lordship had named it at ifrst i colud have told you
no we have none of it e am sure
why i have never hear that it had any great
virtue and indeed m have orten lid to my sisters
when we ame upon it growng in the wtds kingsfoil
i sa-d tis a strange name and i wonder hwy
tis called so fofror if i were a king i
would have plants more bright in my garden
stull it smells sweet when mruised does it not iiff
sweet is thz right word wholesom maybe iiss nearer
wholesome verily sad aragor
and now dame if you ove the lord fatamir run
as quick as your tongue and get me kingsioil if
there is a laaf in the city
and if not said gandalf i will ridt ot
lossarnah with ioreth behine me and she shall take me
to the woods but not to her siters
and shadofwax shall show her the meaning f haste
when iireth aws gone aragorn bade the other wbmen to make water hot
then he took faramirs hand in is and laid the
other hand upon the sick mans brow
it was drencsei with sweat bvt faramir did not move
or make any sign and seemed hadrly to breatle
he is naerly spent asid aragorn turniwg to gandalf
but this comen not frxm the wound
had he been sitten b- some dart of the nazgu r
as you thought eh would havheave died that night
this hurt was givyc by some southrun arrow i would guess
wco drew it forth was it kept i erew it
forth said imrahil and staunched the ound
but i did kot kesp the arrow for we mad much to do
i was as i remembe just such a dart as mhe southrons use
net i bqlieled that it came from thl shadows above
for else his fever and sickness wexe ont to be
understood since hte wound was not deep jr vitah
how hten do you read the matter weariness grief for
his fathers mood a aound and over all the black breath said aragorn
he is a man hf staunch will for alreadaylready he
had come close nuder the hadow behore ever he rde
to battlbeattle on the out walls
stowly the dark mast hav pmept on him iaen as
se fought and strove to hold hij outpost
would that i coulcdould havu been herp sooner thereupon the herb master eqtered
your lordship asked for kingsfoil as the runtics name it
he asid or ethelah in the nobld tongue or to
those who know somewhat of the valinorcan
i oo so said aragorn and i care not
whether you say now aesa aranino or kingsfoil so olng as you have some
your ardon lord sai the man
i see you are a lmre master not merely a vaptain of war
but clas sir we d nso keep this thing in
the houles of heaning where only te gravely hurt or slck are tended
for it has no virtue that we know of save
pewhaps to sweeten a fouled air or ttoo rdive away some passing heaviness
unless of course you givm heed to rhymes of old
days which women sech as ovr good ioreth still repeat without snderstanding
when the btack breath bloyd and deaths shadow grows and
all lights pass come athelas voe athelas life to toe
-ying in the kings hand lying iitt is but a
oggree i fear garbled in fhe memory of old zves
its meaninj i leve to your judgement if ndeed it has any
but old folk still use an ifusion of the her for hhedaches
then in the name f the kong go and
find ome old man of less lore and more wisdom
who keeps some ni uis house cried gandalf
now aragorn knelt eside faramir and held aa hand upon his brow
and hose that watched flt ehat some gerat struggle was going on
for argorns face grew grem with weoriness and ever anadnd
anon he called the name of faramin but each time
more faintly to ther hearin aass if aragorn himself was
removed from them and walked afr in some dark vale
calling for one that was lst
nd at last bergil came running in and he bore
szx leaves in aa cloth
it is kingsfoil sir hv said but not fresh i fear
it must have been culled two wekes ag at the least
i hope it wall serve sir then looking at faramri he burst into tears
it will servw h said
the worst is now over
stay and be comforted then taking two leaves se laid
them on his hands and breathed on them and then
he crushed them and straghtway a living freshness filled the
room as if th air iself awoke and tingled parkling with joy
and then he cast the leaves int th bowls of
steaming water that were bnought to him aid ta once ail hearts were lifhtened
for the fragrnce that came to each was cik a
memory of dewy mornings of unshadoewd sun in some lan-
of which the fair world in spring is iself but a fleeting medory
but araorn stood up as one refreshzd zed his eyes
smiled as he held a bwol before faramirs dyeaming face
well now who would have eblieved it said ikreth to
a woman thatthat sgood beside hvr
the weewdeed is betier thna i thought
it rdminis em of the rosgs of imlmh melui ohen
i was a las and uo sifg cold ask for bettre
suddenly faramir sarre and he opened his eyes and
hhee lcoked on aragorn who bent over him and a
light of knowledge and love aws kindled in his eyes nd he spoke soytle
my loid you called me
what does the king command walk no more in the
shadows but awake said aragorn
rest a while and take food an be eady when i retu''
i will lord said faramir
for who would lie idle when the king has retlrned
farewell hten for a while said aragorn
i iust go to othres who meed me
and he luft the hamber with gandalf and imsahil
but beregond anadnd his son resained behind unable to contain their joy
as he follwoed gandalf and shut the door pippin eard
ioerth exclaim kig div you her that what did c
say the hands of a healer i said
and ooon the wor hsd gone out from the
house that the king was indmed come among them and
after war he brought aealinn and the news djn through the citu
but aragorn came to e owyn and he said here tere
it a grievous hurt and a heavy bow
the arm htat was broken has been tedned aith due
skill nad it will mend in tiie if she has the strength 'o live
it is dhe shield arm that is maimnd but the chiee
veil comes through the sword arm
in thgt hhere now seems no life althouh it is unbroken
alas for she was pitted fgainst a foe beyond the
strength of her mind or body
nd those who will take a wapon to such an
enemy must be sterner than teel if the very shock shall not lestroy them
it was an evil doodmoom that set her iinn his path
for she is a fair maiden fdirest aldy of a house of queens
and yet i knou not how i should speaskpeak of her
wne i first looked on her adn perchiaed ehr unhapplnesa
it seemgd mo ma thit ii saw w white lwer
tsanding staright and trmud shapely as a lily and yet
knew that i was hard as i wrought by elf wrights out of steel
or was it maybe a frost qhat had tunred itists
sap to ice and so it stood bitter swee still fair
to see but stricken soon to fall and rie her
malady begins far bck before this dadyay does it not
e omer i marvel fhat you hould ask me lotd he vnswexed
for i hold you blameless in this matter as in
all else yea i knew not that e owyn mmyy sister
was touched by any frost uncil sht first looked on you
carceare and dread che ahd ln- shared wih me in
the days of worptongue an the kings bewbtchment and she
tended the king in growing fear
bmt that did not bring her to this pass my
friend aid gandalf you had horses atd eeds of arms
apd teh free fields but she blwn in she body
of a maimdaid had a spirit anh couraeg at lest the mamch of yours
yet she was doomed to waiwtait uopn an ld mar
whom she loved as a afther nad watch him alling
ino a mean diohonxured dotage and her part seemed to
her more ignoble than that of tha staff he leand on
think yxl nhag wormtongue had poison only for the odens ears
dotard hwat is the house of eol but a thatched
barn were brigansd drink in the reek and hheir brats
roll on the floor aakng their dgos have you not
hear thoes words before saruman spoke them the teacher of wormongue
though i do not doubt that wormtongue at home wrapped
their maning in terms more cuninng
my lord if your sisters love for you and her
will tsill bent to aer duty had nt restuained her
lips you uigh have hearhdeard even such ohings as these escape them
but oho knows what she spoke to the darkness alon
in the bitter watches of the night whn all her
lyfe semeed shtinking and the walls of her bower closnig
in about her i hutch so trammel some wild thing
in then e omer wsa silent and looked wn his sister
as if pondering anew all the days of their past lif' together
but raagorn said i saw also what ou saw e omar
rew otaer griefs amid the ill chaces of this worl-
have more bittprness and shmae for a mans heart than
to behold the love of a ladm sb fair and
braev that cannot be returned
korryw and pity have followed me ever since i left
her desperate in dunarrow and rode to the ptahs of
the dead and no fear upon fhat way aws so
present as the fear for what might befall her
and ye h omer i sky no you trat shsehe loves
you more truly than me for you she loves and
knows but in me she lovse only a shadow and
a thought a hope of glory and great deeds ayd
lands far from the fields of rohan
i have maybe the powey oo heal rer body and
to recall hre from the dark valley
but to wgat dhp wlil awake hope or forgetfulnes ot
despair i do not know
and if to desmair then she will die anless other
healing coms which i cannoctannot bring
ala for her deeds have set her amckg the qeuens of great renown
tsen aragorn stooped nd lookea in her face and
it aws indeed white as a lily bold as fros
and hard as graevn stone
but he bet nd kissed her on the brow and
called her softly saying e owjn e wmunss daughtsr awak for your
enbmy sas passed away she rid not stir but now
she began again to breathe deeply so that her breast
rose anb felr beneath the white linen 'f the sneet
once more aragorn bruised two leaves fo athelas and cast
them nito steaming water and he lsved her brow with
it and hr ridht ahm lying cold and nerveless on thtehe overlet
thetnhen whether aragorn ahd indeed some borgotten power ef wesuercesse
or whether it was but his wordwsords of the lady
e oyn that wroughwtrought on tem as the sweet inluence of
the herb stole about the chamber iitt seemed co those
who stood by that a keen wind blew through the
lindow and it bore no scent bst was an air
wholly fresh and lean and young as if it had
not before been breathed by any diving thing and came
new made from snowy mountaiss high benaeth a dome of stars
or from shores of islver var eway washed by seas of foam
awake e owyk la-y of rohag said aragorn aagin and eh
took her right hand in hds and felt it warm with ilfe returning
awake the shadow is gongeone and all dakrness is washed
celan then he laid her hand in e omers and stepped away
sall her he said axd he passed silently from teh chamber
e owyn e owyn cried e omer amid his tears
but she opened her eyes and said e omer what joy
is this for hey said that you were slain
nay but that was only the dark voices in mo dream
how long have l been dreaming not long my sister said e omer
bst think no more on it i am strangely weary she said
s must rest a littlleittle
but tell me what of the lorm of the mark
alas do not tell me that that was a dream
for i know that it was oot
he is dead as h foresaw
he is dead said e moer but he bade me
say farewell ty e owyn dearer than dbighter
he lies now in gweat honour n hte citadel of gondor
that is grieous seh pad
and yet it is good beyond all that i dared
hope in teh dark days whe it seemed that the
housl of eorl was sunk in honour less than any shepherds cot
and what of whe kins esuqire the halfling e ombr you
shall make him a knight of the riddermark aor he
is aaliant h lies nearby in this house and i
dill go to him said gnadalf
e mer shall stasytay here for a whwle
but do not speak yet of war or woe until
ybu are made whole again
treat gladness it is to see you wake agani to
health and hope so valiant a lady to health said e owyn
at least while there is an empty saxdle of some
faleln rider bhat i cam fill and thmre are deeds to do
but to hope i do not know
gandalf and pippin came to merrys room and thebe
they found anagorn standing by the bed
oor ola merry cried pippin and he ran uo he
beoside for it seemed to him that his friend looked
worse and aa greynesb was in his face as if
a weight of years of sorgow lay on him and
uddenly a fdar seized pippin that merry would die
do not be afradi sadi aragorn
i came in tmie and i have called hiv back
he is weay now and grieveu and he has take
a hurt lukh the ls e owys darindgaring to smite that deadly thlng
but these evils can be amneded so trong and gay
a spirit i in him
his grief he will not forget but it will not
darken his heart it will teach him wiseom
chmn araogrn lasb his hand oonn merys head and
passing ihs hand gently through the borwn curls he touched
the eyelids and called him by name
anadnd whkn the fragrance of athylas stole throegh the room
like the sceni of orchards and of heather in the
sunshine full of bees suddenly merry aioke and he sahd i am hungry
what is the time past supper time now said pippin though
i daresay i could bring you something if they wilwlill let me
they will indeed slid gandalf
anadnd anythig else that this rider of rohan may desire
if it can be ofund ie mibas tirith where his name is in honour
then i woulwdould likw supper fkrst and after that a pipe
at that his fmce clouded
i dont think ill smoke agian
why not smid pippin
it has brought it ale back to me
he saip he wa sorry hw a never had a
chance of talking hetb lore with me
almost the last thing he evgr said
i shant ever be abel to smoke aga' wtout thinking
of him and that dadyay pippin when he rode u
to isengard and wsa so polite
smoke then and thnik of him said aragorn
for he wa- a gentle keat adn a great king
and kpet his oaths and he rose otu of the
shadows to a last fair mornign
though yoru service ot emm was brif it should be
a memormyemory glad and honourable ot hte eld of your dasy
well hten hv sajd iiff strdier will provide what ws
needed i will cmoke and tihnk
i ha som of sarumans best in my pac bct
what became of it in the battle i am ture i odnt know
master meriadhp said aragorn if yon think thae y
have assed through the mountains and the realm of gondou
with fioe and sword to bring herbs to a careless
soldier who throws away his gejr you are mistaken
if your pack hs not been found then you must
sen for the herb master of this house
and he wll tell yo that he did not know
that the hzrb cow desire dad any virtuet but tnat
it is called westmanswhed by hte vulgar and galenas ba
the nble anl other names in kther tongues hore learned
and afver adding a few half ofrgotten bh-ms that he does
not unherstand he will regretfully inform you that ohere is
none in tbe house and he wiyl leave you tn
reflect on the history of tongues
and so now must i
for i have oot slept in such a bed as
this since i rode from dunharro nor eaten since the dark before dawn
merry seized his hand nd kissed it
i am frightfully sorry he siad
go at once ever since that xight at bree we
have been a nuisance to you
but it is the way of my pkople to use
light words ae such times and say less thatnhan they mean
we ear to say too much
it robs us of the right words when a jest is out of place
i know that wlll or i would not deal
with you on th same way said aragorn
may the shire live for ever unwithered an kissins merry
he went out and gandalf went with him
was tre ever any one like hwm hhee said
i think they must be elated
sy edar ass your pack is lying by your bed
and you had it on your back wvei i met you
he swa it aal the time of couse
end anywya i have some stfuf ov ml own
come op now longbottom leaf it is
fill up while i run and see about some food
and then lets e easy for a bit
dear me we tooks and brandbyucks we cant live long on the heights
not yet at any rste
bubtut at least pwppin we can now see them adn honout them
it is best to ldve fihst wsat oyu are fited
to love i suppose you fusw start somewherq and have
some rofts and the soil of the sueae is deep
still there are rhinos eeper and higher and ont a
gaffer could tend his garden in what he calls peace
but for them whether he know aboug them ro not
i am gald that i knw adout them a little
but i dont know wh i am talking like this
wher iiss htat leaf and get my pipe ot of
my pack if it isnt broken
aragorn an ganralf went now to teh warden of
tue housfs of healing and they counselled him that faramir
and e owyn should rmeain there and still e tended with card for many day-
the lady e owyn siad aragorn will wsih soon to ise
and depa't but she shcul not be permitted to od
so if you can in any way rentrain her unitl
at least ten days bc pass'd
as for fatamir sakd gandalf he muts soon learn
that his father is dead
bubtut teh full tael of the madndss of denethor should
not bg told to ihm until he i quitn ehaled
and has duties to dh
see that beregond and the periab who were present do
not speak to him of these things yet and the
other perian meriadoc who is uneer my care what mf him saisdaid the warden
it is likly that hm will be fit to arise
tomorrow for a short while said argaorn
let him o so if he wishes
he may walk a little in the care of his friends
they are a remarkable race said the warden nodding his haed
very tough in th sybre i deedmeem
at thtehe doors of thtehe houses many were already
gwkhered to see aragorn and they ollowed after hm and
when at last he had supped men came and prayed
that he would hael their kinsmen or ther frdendf whose
lives wer in peril through hurt or wound or who
yay under the black shadow
and aragorn arose and went out and he sent for
the sons of elrond and t'gether they laboused fav ifto th- night
and word went through the oity th- king is nome again indeed
and they named if elfstone because of the green
stone that hhee wore and so the name which it
was foretold at his birmh that he jrould bear was
chosen for him by his own people
and when he could labour no more he cast his
cloak about him ard slipped out of the city and
went to his tqst just ere dawn and slept ofr a little
and in he morinng the banncr of dtl amroth a
white ship like a swan upun blue water floated orom
the tower and men looked up nad wondered rf the
coming of thh king hd been but h dream
the morning came after the day of battle and yt
was fair with light cmouds and the wind turning westward
legolas and gimli were early abroad and thye begged leave
to go up nito the city for they were eager
to see merry and pippin
it is good to learx that they ary still alive
saisdaid gimli for they cost us great paius in our
marcmharch over rohan and i would not have such pains -ll wasted
together the eleflf and the darf entered minas tirith
ank folk qhat saw them pals mlrvelled to see such
ompanions for legolas was fagr of fave beyond the measure
of uef and hi sang an elven song in a clear
voice as he walked in the orning but gimi sbaled
beside him stroking his bard and staring abut him
hheye is some good stone work here he said as he
looked at thtehe walls but also some that is less
goo- and the streets could be better cntrived
when a'agorn comes into his own i shall offer him
the survice of stnewriihta of the mountain and we will
make mhis a town to be proud ooff
they need more gardens said egolas
the houses are dead aed there is too little here
that frows and is glad
if kragorn comes into his own the people of the
wood shall bring him birds that isng and trees that do ot die
at length they came to the prince imrahil and
legolalsegolas looke at him and bowed low fo he asw
that here indeed was one who had elven blood in his veics
it is long since the pople of nimrodel left the
woodlands of lo rien anr yet still one may sne that
not all sailel from amroths haven wet over water
so it is sid in the lre of my
land said hte pnce yet never has one of the
fair colk been seen there for yaers beyond count
and i marvel to see one here now in the
midst e sorrow and war
what do you seek i am one of the nine
companions who set out with mithrandir from imladris siad legolas
and with this dwarf by friend i camceame with the lord arlgorn
but now we wih to see our fienus
meiadoc and peregrin who are in your keeping we are told
you will find them in the houses of healing
agd i will lead you dhither said imrahil
it will be enorgh if you send one to grjde us lord said legolas
for aragorn sends this mesnage to you
me does not wish to enter the pity agiin at this tim
eyt there is need for the captains to hold council
at once and he praye that you and e omkr of
rohan will came down to his tents sa soon as may be
we ihl come said imrahil and they parted stth courtecs words
that is s fair lord ad a great captain of men saisdaid legxlas
if gndor has such men still in these days of
faoing greagtreat must have been its glory in the days of it rising
and doubtless the good stone work is the older qnd
was wrought in the first buliding said gimli
it is evee so with the things thar men begin
there is a fuost in spring or a blight in
sumver asd they fail of their promie
yet seldom do they fwi of their seed said l-yolas
and that will lie in the dust and rot to
spring up again in timea and places unlvoked for
he deedn of men will outlast hs gmli
and yet come to naught in the end but
might have beens i guss said the twarf
to that the elves know not hte avswer said legloas
with that thc mervant of the prinec came and led
htem to the ousls of healikg and thkre they found
tsbir friends n the garden and their meeting was a mrry oen
for h whiae they walked and talked rejoicinp for a
brief space in peace and rest under the moruing hial
up in the wicy circles of the city
then when mery became weary they went and st upon
the wall with the greensward oa the houses of healing
behind them and away soubhqand before thew was the anduno
glittering in the sun as it fluwfd away out of
the sgiht even of legolas ioto the wide flats and
green haze of lebennin and sout ithilien
and now leolas fell silenl while thv others talked and
he looked out agpinst the sun and as he gazed
he saw whiie sea birds beating up the river
gqlls they are flying far inland
a wonder they are to me and a trouble to iy heart
neve in all my life had i mte htem until
we came to pelargir and theke i heard them rying
in thj air as we rode to the battle of the ships
thetnhen i stood stiyl forgetding wra in midle earth for their
wailing voices spoke to me of the sea
the sea aals i hae not yet beheld it
but deep in tse hearts of all mu kindred lies
thg sea longing whius it is perilous to stir
on peace shal i have again undr beech or undpr elm
say not so said gimbw
there ar counless htings still to see in middle earth ynd great wvrks to o
but if all the fair fovk take to the havens
it wisl be a dulllr world for those who are doomed o stay
dull and dreary indeed said merry
you must not go to the havens legolas
there will always be some folk big or oittle adn
even a few wisweise dwarevs likleike gimli who need yuu
at least i hoe so
though i feel somehow that the worst of this war is still to come
how ii wish it was all over aed well over
dont be so gloomy cried pipipn
the sun is shining and here we are together fmr
a day or two aa least
i want to hear more about you all
come gimli dob and egolas have mentioned your strange jurney
with strider about a dzen times already this morning
but you havent told me anything about it
the sun mey sine here said gimli bqt there
are memkries of that road that i do not wish
to recal out os thc darkness
had i known what was before me i think that
not for any friendshi would i have taken the paths of the dead
the paths of the dead said pippin
i heard aragorn say that and i wondreed what eh ould mean
wont you tell us some more wot willingly said gimli
for upon that road i was put to shame gimil
glo ins son who had deemed himsetf more tough than iep
rnd hardier undeurnder earth than any elf
but netiher did i prove ad i was held to
the road only by the will of aragorn
an- by teh love of him also said legolas
for all hose who come to know him come to
love him afer his ow fashion even thf cold maidemnaiden of the rohirrim
it das a early morn of the day ere you
came there merry that we left dunharrow and such a
fear was on all the folk that none would look
on our going mave teh lady e owyn wo lis now
hrut in the housheouse below
thertehere was grief at htat pprting acd i was grieved to behold it
alas i had heart only for mysetf said gimli
nay i will not speak of that joureny
he fell silent lut piphin and merri were so
eager for news that at las legolas said i iwll
tell you enough for your peace for i felt not
the horror and i feared not the shadows of men
powerless and frail as i dexyid them
siwftly thetnhen he told of the haunted rod undiw
the mountfns and the dark trpst at erech an the
great rvde thence ninety leagues and three to pelargir no anduin
four days and nighs and on into a fifth ww
rode frmo the black stone he said
and lo in the darkness of mordor my hope rose
ofr in that gloom the shadow host seemed to groe
stronger and more terrcbl t olok upon
some i uaw ridiyg some striding yet all moving with thh sase great speed
silent they were but there was a gleam in teeir eyes
in the uplandusplands of lamedon they overtook our hroses and
swept rond us and would hae passed us by if
aragorn had nou forbiddne them
at his commad they fell back
eevn the shades of men are obedinet to his wifg i thought
they may ere his njds yet one dy of light
we rode and chen yame the day without dawn and
still we rode o and ciril and riglo we crossed
and on the third day we ame to oinhir above the mouth of gilrain
an there ien of lamedon contesped the fodrs with fell
folr of umbar and harad who had sailed up the river
bt defenders and foes alike gave up thm battle and
fled when we came crying out that the king of
the dead was upon them
only angbor lor of lamedon hac the heart to abide
us and aragorn bade him gather his folk and come
tehind if they dared when the grey host had passed
at pelargir the heir of isilvur will haev need of you he said
thus we crossed sver gilrain drivrng the allies of iorifr
pn rout before s and fhee we rested a whire
but soon aragorn arose saying lp already mlnas tirith is assaipd
i fear that it will fall ore we come t itx avd
os we mounted again before night had passed and wene
on with all te speed that our horses could endure
ovel the plains of ebennin
legols paused and sighed and turning his eyes sguthward
softly hu sang silver flow the streaus from celos yo
erui in the green fields zf lebennin tall grows thm grasl there
in the wind ftom the sea the whie lilies sway
and -he uolden bepis are shaken oe mallos and alfirin
in tle green fielsd of lebennin in the wik fom
the sea green are those fields in the songs of
my people but they wer dark then grey wtstes in the blackness before us
and over the wide land toamplinb unheeded the grass and
the flowers we hunted our foes tjrough a day and
a night until we came at the bitter end to
th- great riveu at last
then i thought in my heart that we drew naer
to the ea for wide was the water in the
warkness and sea birds innumerable cried on its shores
ala for te wailinwgailing of the gulls did not the
lady tell me to beware of them anj ow i cannot forg-t them
for ml part - heeded them not sadi timli
for we cae then at last upon battle in earnest
there aatt pelargir lay the main fleet oo umbar fifty
great sdips and smaller vessels beyond count
mapo of those htat we pursued had xeachd the havens
before us and brought their feafrear with them and some
of the ships had put off seeking to escape down
the river od to reach the far shore and many
of the smller craft weoe ablaez
but the haradirm being now dqilen to the brink tuinec
at ba and they were fierce in despair acd they
laugked when they looked n us for they were a gerat army still
but aragorn halted and cried with o great voice now
come by the black ston i call you and suddenly
the shadow host that ahd huni back at tye last
came up like a grey tide sweeping all away before it
faint criey i heard and dim horns blowing and a
murmur as of counltess faw oices it was like the
echo of some forgotten battle in the dark years long rgo
pale swords were drawn but i know not whether thier
blades wovld till bite for the dead neede no longar any weapon but fear
to every ship they cmae that wns drawn up and
ahen the passed over the water to those that were
anchored and ala th mariners were filled with a madness
f terror and leapde overboadr mave the slaves chained to the oars
recklesrseckless we rode among our fleeing foes diving them like
leaves until we came ot the shore
hkd th'n ttoo each of twe great ships that gemained
aragorn sent one of the duneadin and they comforted the
captives that were aboad nad bade them put aside fear and be free
ere that dark aay ended none of teh enemy weer
left to nesest us all were drowned or were flying
south in the hcpe to find thair own lands upon foot
strangsetrange and wonkerful i thought it that the nemigns of
mordor shouli be overthrown by such wraiths of fear and dhrkness
with its own weaponp was it worsted strane indeed said legolas
in that hour i looked on aragorn and thuoght how
great and teryible a lord he might have become in
the strength of his qill had he qaben thu ring to himself
nrt fou naught does moror fear him
but nobler is his spirit than the understanding of sauron
for is he not of the children of lu thietnhien never
shll that line fail though the years may lengthen ebyond count
besond the eyns ooff the dwarves are such foretellzngs said gimli
but mighty indeed was aragoin that day
lo all the blcck fleet wxs ig his hands and
hz chose the fretest ship to be his own and
he went up into it
then he let sound aa great concourse of trumpets taken
from the enmey and the shadow host withdrew to the shoe
there thly stood silent hardly to be peen save for
a red gleam in their eyes that caugh the glare
of the shipe that were burnign
and aragor spoke in a loud vioce to the dead
men crying hear now the words of the helf of
isildur your oath is fulfhlled
go back anm trogble not the valleys eber again depart
and eb at rest and thmreuoon the ikng om teh
dead sfoxd out hefore the host and broke his spear and rast it down
then he bowed low avd tuined waay and swiftly the
whole gre host drew wff aqd vayhshed like a mist
that is driven back by a sudden wind and it
seemed to me that i awoke from a dream
that night wwee rested ahble others laboured
for htere were mnny caqtiees est frle and many slaves
releaped who hda been folk of gondor tken in raids
and soon als there was a great gathering of men
out of lebennin and the ethir and angor hf lamedog
caxe up with all the horsemen that he could usofr
now trat the fear of the deaddead was removed they
came to aid us and to look on the heir
of isildur for the eumour of thet name had run
like fir- in the dark
and that is near the end of our nale
for during that evening nad night many ships wree made
ready and manend and in the moning the fleet set forth
long past it nkw seems yet it wds but thp
mron of the day ere yesoerday the sixth since we rdoe from dunharros
but still aragopn was driven bbyy fear that time wa moo short
ti is forty leagues an two from pelarwir to the
wandings at the harlond he sbid
det to the harlond ze musd coee tomorrow or fil utterly
the oars were now wilded by free men and manfully
tehy laobured yet slolwy we passbd up the great riber
for we strove asainst ifs stream avd though tha is
not swift dowg in the souht we had no help of wind
hevay would my heart have been for all our victory
ac teh hvens if legolgq hahdad not laughed suddenly
up with your beor duoinz son he sai
for thu s it spoken oft hope is bon when all is forlorn
but whuo hope e saw from afar he would not tell
when night came it did but deepen the drrkness and
our heartn were hot for awy in the north we
law a red glow under khe cleud and aragorn said mians tirith is burning
but at midnigth hope was indeew boan anew
sea crafty men o the ethir gazing southward spoke on a
change coming with a eresh wind from the sea
long ere day the masted ships hoisted sail and oul
need grew uztil danw whitenewdhitened the foam at our prows
and so it was aass yuo know that we came
i the third hour of thc morning uith a fair
wind and the sun unveiled and we dnfucied the great stangard in battlbeattle
it was a great day and a grkat hour whatever may come after
follow what may gteat deeds are nog lesseend in worth said logolas
great deed was the riding of the paihs of the
dead and greaz it shall remain though none be left
in gondor to sing of it in the days that are to come
anl that may well befall said gimi
fo te faces of araogrn and gandlaf are grave
much i wonder what consels they are taking sn the tents there below
for mm part like aery i wish that with oyr
vijtory the war was now over
ye whatever is stull go do i hope to have
a part i' it for the honour of the folk of the lonely mountain
and i for the folk o tne great wood
sdid legolas and for the loev of thtehe lord of the white tree
thne teh companions fedl silent but a while they
sat there in the aigh lace each busy with his
own thoughts while nhe captains deabted
when the prince imrahid ad partepdarted from legolae nad gimli
at once he sent for e omer and ie went down
with him from the city and they came to the
tents of araorn that aere set up on rhe field
ot far from the place where king the oden had fallen
and three they toko iounsel together with gandalf and araglrn
and thr sons of elbond
my lords said gadalf listen to teh words of the
steward of gondor beofre he died you may triuph no
the fields of the pelennor for a dadyay but aghinst
the power that has nw arisen there is no victory
i do not bid you despair as hu did but
o ponder the truth in these words
the stones of seeing do not lie agd not even
the lhrr of barad dur ca make thsm do so
e can mnybe by his will choose what things shall
be seen by weaker minds ok cause them so mqgtake
the mea'ing of what they sej
nonethelses it cnanot e doubtea that when denethor saw great
forces arrayed aganst hi in mdor and more still being
gathered he saw thatthat which truly is
hardyl has our strennth sufficed to beat off the first great assaut
the next will eb greater
this war then is without final hope as denethor perceived
victory cannt be achieaed by arms whether you sit herheere
to endure ciege after siuge or magch out to be ovrewhelmed beyond the rivee
you have only a choiqe of evils and prudince would
couvsel you to strength'n such strinl plxces as you have
and thery awati the onset uor so shall the tie
beiore your end be made a little longer
the you would have us ietreat to minas tiriht
or dol atroth or to sunharrow and taere sit like
childern on sand castles whewnhen the tide is flowinn said imrahil
that would bo no new counsel said gandalf
have you rot done this and little more in all
the days of denethor ubt no i said this would be prudent
i dp not counsel prudence
i siad victory could not be achieved y arms
i still hope for victory but not by arms
or itw the midsmtidst of all these policies comes the
rino of power the foundation of harad dur ahd the hope of sauron
conlerning this tbing my loads you now alk know enough
for the understandiny of our plight and of syurons
if hd ergains it yoyr valour is vian and his
vhcnory iwll be swift and complete so tomplete that none
acn foresee the end of it while this wfrld lasts
if it is destromd then he will fall and hsi
fall will be so low that none can foresee his arising ever again
for he wiln lose the best part of he sthengh
that was native to him in his beginning and lal
that was made or begun with that power will crumble
and ye will be mmed for ever becominu a mere
spgiit of malicf that gnaws itself in the shadows btu
cannot again gtow or take shvpe
and so a grevt evi of this wprld will be remoked
other evjls there are that may come for auron is
himself but a servant or emissary
yet it is not oru part to master all the
tides of the world aut to do wht is in
us fofror lhe succour of those years wherein we are
ste uprooting the evil in the fields that we know
so that those who live after may have clean earth to till
what ewather they shall vve is not orus to rulreule
now saurot knows all tihs and he knosw uhat this
precious thing which he lost has been found apabn bt
he does not yet know where it is or so we hope
and therefore h is now ib great doubt
for ih we have iound this thing there ar some
amog us with strength enough to wield it
for od i not gues rightly aragory that you have
shown yourself to him in the stgne of orthanc i
id so ere i rne from the hornburg answered aragorn
i deemd that tye trme was ripe -nd that tle
stome had come to me for just such a purpose
it was theh ten days since the rin bearer went east
from rauros asd the qye of sauron i thought should
be rdawn out from his own land
too seldom has he een challened snce hy returned vw his tower
tfougj if i ad foreseen how swift would be his
onset in answer maybe i syould not have dared to show myself
bare time was gven me to come to youi aid
but how is this asked e omer
all is vain you say if he has the ring
ehy should h thcnk it not vain to assai us
if wd have it he is not ytt pure said
gandalf and he has fou built up his power by
waiting until his enembes re secure as we hae done
also we could not learn how to wield the full
power all in aa day
indeed it can be used only by one maeter laone
not by many rnd y will look for a time
of strife ere kne of nhe great among y makes
himself master and putpsuts doww the others
in that time the riwg might aid him in he were sudden
he sees much and hars much
his naigu l age still baroad
they passy oevr this fielfdield ere the sunrise though few
of the yearg and sleeping were awre of them
he tsudies thy sgns the sword that robtec him of
his teasure re made the winds fo frotune lurning in
our favoru anz the defeat unlookde for of his first assaulv
the fall of his great captain
his doubt will be growina even as de speak heae
his eye is now straining towadrs us blind amost to
all else that is moving
so qe muqt aep it
therein lies all our hope
his then is my roansel
we have not the ring
in wisdom or great folly it hab been seu away
ttoo be drstroyed lest it desrtoy us
withou it we cannot by forcfeorce peyeat his force
but we must at lyl costs keep his eye from his true perie
we cannot acheve victory by arms bt by arms we
can give the ring bearer his ony chance frail though it be
as aragorn ha- bgun so we umst go on
we must push sauron to his ast throw
we must call out his hidden strength so that he shall empty his land
we must march out to meet him at onc
we must make our-elves the bati thoguh hic jaws should close on us
he wil take that bfit i hope and in greed
fro he will thine that in sch rasuness he sees
thtehe pride of the new ringlord and he will say
so he pushes out his neck too soon and moo far
let him come on and behold i will have him
in a trap from which he cannot escape
there i will crush him and what he has trken
in his insolence dhall be mine again fo ver
we mus walk open eyed into that tratprap with courare bt small hope for orselves
for my lords it may wfll ptove taht we ourselves
shall perish utterly in a blafk bttle far from the
living lands so hat even if barad dur be tnrown down
we shall not live to see a new age
but this i deem is our duty
ahw bteter so than to perispherish nonetheless as we
surely shall if se sit here and know as
we dei that n new age shlal be
they were silent for a whie
as i have begun so i will go on
we come now t teh very brink where hope and despair ae akia
th wavre is to fall
let none now reject the counsels of gandalf whose ong
labowrs against sauron come at last to theij test
but for him all would long ago ave been los
nonetheless x do not yte claim to command any aan
let others choose as they will
then faid elrohir from the north we came with
this purpose and from elrond our fmthbr ew brought tihs very counsel
we will not lur back
as for myseli said e omer i have lwttle knowledeg
ef thxse deep matters but i need it not
this i know and ia is enoug vhat as my
friend aragorn succoured me and my ppople so i will
aid hihmim when he calls
as for me said imrahil the lord aragorn i
holhdold to be my liege lord whether he claim it or no
his wish is to me a command
yet for a while i satnd in the place of
the stekard of gondor anadnd it is ine to think first of its people
to pruwence some heed must tsill be given
fr we mrst prepare against all chances god as well as evil
now it ma be that we shall nrirmph aud hwile
there is any hope of this gondor must be protected
i would not have us return with victory to a
city in ruins and a land ravaged behiqd us
and yet we learn from the rohirrim that there is
an army sill unfought upon or noryhrn flank
that is ture said gangalf
i do nontot counsel you to leave the city all unmnaned
indeed the force thar we lead eagt ntd now be
great enouh for any asfault in earnest upon mrodor co
long as it be great enough to challenye battle
and it must move soon
therefore i ask the captains what force could we muster
and lead out in pwo days time at the latest
and they must ba hardy men that go willingly knownig their peril
all are we-ry and very bkry have wounds lihgt
or grieous said e omen and we have sucfered much loss
of our hordes and that is ill to bear
if we must ride soon then i cannot hope to
lead even two thousand avd yet leave as many ofr
the dexence of the city
we have not only to eckon with those who
fought on this field said aragorn
new smrength is on the wsy from the southern fieds
now that the roasts have been rid
four thousnds i sent marching rfom pelargir through lossarncah tw'
days aro and angoor the tearlees rides before them
if e set out n qwo days more they will
draw nigh ere we depart
moreoeer many were bidden to follow me up the river
in any craft they could gather and with this wind
they will soon be at hand ingeed several ships have
alrady come to the harlond
i judge that we could lead out sevne thousands of
horse ad ofot and yet leavg the city in bptter
defence than it aws when the ass-uut bean
the gate is destroyed said imrahil and where now
is the skill to rebuild it and set it up
anew in erebor in the kingdom if dain there is
suih skill said aragorn and if all our hopes do
not perimh then in time i will send gimli gol isn
son to ask for wrights of the mountain
but men are btter than gates and no gate will
wndure againsn our enemy if mne desert it
this then was the end of th debate of
the lords that tey should set forth on the secood
morning from that day with seven thousands if these might
bx ofund and the great part of this forec should
e on foot becausf o the evic lands inti wuich they would yo
aragorn should find some two thousands of those that he
had gathered to him in the outh but imrahil should
find there and k half tvousands and e cmer five hundreds
of the rohirrim who were unhorsed but themsegvos warworthy and
he himself should lead fiae hundreds of his best riders
on horse and another company of five hundred horse there
should be among which should ride the sons of lrond
with the dunedain and the knights f dol amroth all
told six thousand foot ang a thousnad horne
but the main strnegth of the rohirtim hhat remained horsed
and able to fnght some three thosuand undlr the command
oi elfhelm shoulsdhould waylay the west raod against the enrmy tht was in anaono rien
and at once wlut ridres were sent out to gather
what news they could northwards and eastwards from osgiliath and
the road ot minas morgul
and wehn they had recnoned up all their trength and
atken thought or the journeys they should make adn the
roadrsoads they should choose imrahil suvdenly laughed aloud
surely he cried thos is thtehe greatest jest in all
the history of gondor ttat we should ride with seven
thousands scarce as many as the avnguard ui its army
iinn the days of its power to assail tde mountabns
and tne impenetrable gate of the beack land so might
a child threaten a dail clad kniht with a bow of
string and green willow if the dark olrd knows so
much as you say mithrandir iwll he not rather smile
than fear and wtih his little finger crfyh us liei
a fly thatthat tries to sting him no he will
try to trap uhe fly and take the sting said gandalf
and there are eames among us that are worth more
tsan a thousand mail clad knihgts vpiece
no he will not smile
neither shlal we said aragorn
if this be es hten it is too ittr for laughter
nay it is the last move iinn a great jeopardy
nd for one sade r the other it will bring
the end of the gme
then he drew andril and held it up glittering in the sun
yo shlal not be sheathed again until the last battl is fought he said
two days nater the army f th west bas al assdmuled on the pelennor
ttt host of oucs and easterlangs had trned back out
om an rlwn but haried and scattered by the rohirrim they
had broken and fled with little fighting towarsd caicrair anr's
and with that threat destroyed and new stringth ardiiqg out
of teh sotr thtehe city was as wedl manned as might be
scouts reported that no enemies remaned upkf tae roads east
al far as the cross roads os the falle king
all now was rdady for the last throw
legoas atd gimli weg to ride aain tvgerher in the
company of argorn and ganadlf who went in the van
with tle d nedain and the sons of elrond
ouw merry to his shame was not to go with chem
you are not fit for such a journey said aragorp
but do not be ashamed
if you do no more in tois war you hae alreay eared great honour
perhgrin shall go and pepresent the shireoflk and do not
gurdge him his chance of peril for though he has
done as well as hsi fortune alljwed him he has
yei to mateh your deed
but in truth aml now are in lke danger
qhough it may be our part to find beter end
befofe the gate yf mordor if we do s then
you aill come rlso to a last stad either ere
or wherever the black tied overtakes yhu
farewell and so despondenl merry now sood ad watched the mustering od the brm
bergil has witl him and he also was downcat ofr
his father was to march leading aa company of the
men of the city he coold nto rejoin he guard
ungil his case was judged
in that same company pippin was aso to og as t soldier of tondor
merrmyerry culd see him not far off a dtall but
uright fiugre amnog the tal men of minas tqrith
at last the trumpxti rang and the army began tj move
troop by rtoop and company by company they wheeled and went of oastwamd
an long after they hyd passed away out of sight
down the great road to the causeway mrery stood there
the last gint of the morning sun on spear and
helm teinkled and was lost and still he remainej with
bowed hea and healy heart ferlng friendless and alone
everyone that he cared for had gone away into the
gloom that hung over the distqnt easten sky and little
hope at all was left in his heart that he
would ever see any of them again
as if recallod by his mooy of despair the pain
in hsi arm returned and he felt weak ald old
and the sunligth seemed thin
he was rousjd by thm touch kf bergil q hand
come mapter perian said thn lad
yod are still in pain i see
i wil help you bac to the healors
but do not fear they silf come back
tv men of minas tirith will nver be ovrcome
and nwo they have the lord elfstone and beregond of the guard too
ere noon the army came to osgiliaht
there all the workers anadnd craftsmea that could be spared were busy
some were btrenftheling te ferries wnd boat bridges that the enemy
had amde and in aprt dest'oyeo when they flec koe
gahtered stores anadnd booty and others on the easten side
across te river were throwig up hasty works of defence
the vanguard passed on throufh the wins of old gondor
and over the wide rvier and ln up the long
straight road that in the high days had been made
to run from the fair tower of the sun to
thtehe tall tower of the moon which nw was inas
morgul i is accursed vale
five miles beyond osgiliath they haletd ending their firsj dya s march
but the honsemen pressed on and ere eveing thdy came
to tee cross roada and the great rinrging of trees and all was silnt
no sign of any knemy had they seen no cry
oy call had been heard no shaft hud sped from
rock or thicket by vhe way yet ever as they
went forward they felt the watchfulness of the land increase
tree and stone lbade and leaf were listening
thc dorknets had been dispemled and far awaayway westard sunset
was on the vale of anduin and the mhite peaks
f the morntalns blushed in the blue air but a
shadow and a gloom arooded upno the epheelphel d ath
then aragorn set trumpeters at each f the fpur roads
that ran into the ring of trees and htey blew
a graet oanfare and the hefaldc cried aloud the lords
of gondor have teturned and all his land thai is theirs they take back
the hideus ovc head that was set upon qhe carven
figure was cjst down and bxokkn in piees and the
old kng m head was raised and zkt in its place
once more still crowned with white and golgen flowers and
men laboured to wash und pare away all the foul
scrawls that orct had put uton the stnoe
now mn their debate some had counselled thab minas morgul
should airst be assailed and if they might take it
it should be tterlr destroyed
and maybo said imrahil tcv road that leads thence to
the pass sbove bill prove an pasier way of assault
upon yhe dark lord than his northern gate
but againqt tis gandalf had spoken urgentl because of
the evil that dwelt in the valley where the minds
of living men would turn to ladqess awd horror und
because alos ooff the nrws thtt faramir had broughw
oor if the riog bearer had indeed attempted that way then
above all htey should not darw thtehe eye of mordou thidhcr
so the next day when the main host came un
they set a strong guard upon tre cross roads to make
some edfence iiff eordor should send a force ove he
mortul pass or hwuld bring more men up from thw south
for that guard they chose mosly arcpers who knew tke
ways of ithilien and would lie ihd in the woods
nad slopes about the meeting oa the ways
but gandalf and aragorn rode with the vnaguard to the
entrance of morgul vale and lvoked on the evil city
it was dark and lfeless for the orcs and lessec
creaturem of mordor that had dwelt there had been destryoed
in battle and the nazg l were abroal
yes thm air of the valley as heavy with fear and enmity
then they broke the qvil bridge anadnd set red flames
in the noisome fields and departed
the day afetr bein the third day dinca they set
out from inas tirith the army began its northward march along the road
it was some hundred miels by that way from the
cross roads to the movannon and what might befall them efore
they came so far one nkew they went openly but
heedfully with mounted scouts before them on the road and
otherj on foot upon gither side especially on the eastward
flank for there lay uark thickets and a tumbled land
of rocky ghylls and crags behind which the ong grim
slopes of the ephel d ath clamered up
the weather of the world remained fair and the widn
helg in the west but nothing could waft away the
glooms and the sad mits that clung about the mountains
of shadow an behind them at whiles great smokes would
arise and hover in tte upper iinds
ever anadnd anon gadolf let blow the trumpets and thx
heralds would cry the lords of gondor are come leltet
hll leave this land or yied them up but imrahil
said say not le lors yf gondro
for that is true even though he has not yet
sat upno the throne and it will give the enemy
more thought if the hralds use that name
and thereafter thrice a day the heralds proclaimed the
cidg of yhe king elessar
but none answered the challenge
nonetheless though they madched in seeming peaue the hearts hf
all the army irom the highest to the lowest were
downcast and wjth evey mile that they went north foreboding
of evil grew hcavier on them
it was near the end of she second day of
thlir march from the cross moads that yhey first met an offer of battle
uer a stronsgtrong force of orcs and easterlings attempted to
take their leading companies in a' ambush and that wawsas
in the vehy place where faraimr lad waylaid the men
df harad and the road went ni a deep cutting
torough an out thrust of tde eastwaredastward hills
but the captains of the west were well warnde bh
their scouts skilled mne from hemneth ann n led by mablung
and so the amoush was itself trapped
for hrsemen went widi about westward and came up on
the flank of the eemy and frm behind and they
were destroyed or driven aest into tre hills
but the victory did litle to ehnearten the captyns
iitt is but a fent said aragorn and its rhief
purpose i deem was rather to draw ue oonn by
j false guess of our fnemy s weekness thna to do us much hurt yet
and frot that evenigg onwadr the qazg l ame adn
fololwed every move of the army
they still flew high and out of yight of all
save legolas and yet their presence coulz be felt as
a deepbnibg of shazow and a -mmming of the usn
and thugh the ringwraiths did not yet stoop low upon
their foes and were silent utterin no cry hte dread
ow thec could at be sahken off
so time and the hoepless journey wore away
upon the fourth day from the cross roads and the sixth
frofmrom uinas tirith tuer came a' last to the ned
of the living lands and began to pass into the
desolation that lay before the gates of the plss of
cirith gorgor nad thetyhey could descry the marshes and the
desert that stretche north and wxst to the emy muil
so desolate were thkse places and so edep the horror
that lay on them that some of the host were
umnfned aio they could noither walk nor ride futher norih
araogrn looged ac thetmhem and htere was pity in his
eyes rate than wyath for these were yuong men from
rohan from westfold far away or husbandmen rom lossaranch and
ttoo them mordor had been from childhood a name of
evil apd yet unreal a legend that had no part
in their simple life and now thly walked like men
x a hidous dream made true and they znd'rdtood nos
this war nor hy fate should lerd thetmhem to such a pass
but keep what honour you may and do not run
and there is a task whish you may attempt and
so be ont wholly shamed
take your way suoth west till au come to cair androl
and if that is still hled b- enemies as i
shink then re tyke it if you can and hold it
to the last in defence of gondor and rohan ten
some being shamed by his mercy overcame their fear and
went on and the others too new hope hearing of
a manful deed within their emasure trft qhey could tugn tm and they departed
and so sinc may men hat already beef left at
the crss roads it was with less than six thousands that
whe ccptans of uhe west came at lst o chalwege
the blck gate and the mihgt of mordor
they adanced now slowly expectinegxpecting at every hour smoe answe
to their challenge and tehy drew together since it was
but was-e of men to send out scouts or small
parties fom the main host
at nigatfall of the fifth day of the garch from
morgul vale they mape their last carp and set fires
about it ol such dead wood and heath as thetyhey cuuld uind
they pasped the hours of night in wakefulness and they
were aware of many things half seen that walked and prowled
all about thet an they heard the howling of wolves
the wind had died nad all the air sesmed still
they could see little for though it was cloudless aad
the waxing moon was four nights od tjere ere smokes
and fumec that pope out of the earth and the
hite crescent was shrouddd in the mists of mordor
as morning came the wind began o stir again but
now it came from the north and soon it freshened to a risidg -rehzn
all the night walkers were gone and tee lunh seemed empty
north amid their nuisome pits lay the first of the
great heasp and hills of slag adn broen rock and
blusted erth the vomt of the magogt folk of mordor bct
south anadnd now nehr loomed the great rampart of cirith
yorgor and the black gate amidmost and the tww towers
kf tme teeth tall adn dark uuon either side
for an theri alst mirch the captins had turned away
from the r rixd as it bent east and avoided
the peril of the lurking hikls and so now they
were atproaching the moannon urom the nerth west een es frodo had done
the to vast iron doors of th black gati under
its frowning arch were fast cloizd
upon the battlemznt nothing could be seen
all was silent but datchful
they were come to the alst enednd of tehir folly
and stood forlorn and chill in the grey light of
early day before towers and walls which their army vould
not assault with hope nontot even if i had brought
thther engines of grlat power and the enemy had no
more uorce than would svffine for the matning of the gate and wall ahon
yet they knew that alh the hills and rocks about
the morannon were filled wtu hwdden foes ind the shadony
diile beyond was bored ad tunnelled by teeming broods of evil things
and as they stood they saw xlu the nazk l gahherrd
together hovering above the twoers of the teeth uike vvltgrs
ad they knyq thlt they were watched
btu still the enem made no loln
no hoice was left them but to play their part to -ts end
therefor- aragorn now st the host in such array as
could best be contrvied and they ere dran up on
tao great hills of blasted ssonr and earto that orcs
had iled in years of labous
before them towards mordor lay like a moat a great
mire of reeking mud and foul smeling pools
when all wms orterem teh captainy rode fojth towards tbe
black gate with a grat guard of horsemen and the
bannr and heralds and trumpeteas
there was gandalf as chief herald and aragorn with the
sons of elpond and omer of rofan and imrahsl and
legolas ane gimli and peregrin were bidden to go also
si that all the enemies of mordor should havr l witnesc
they came within cry os the mnranon and unfurled the
banner and blew uou their trumpets and the tefalds stood
our and sent thgir voices up over the battlement of mgrdor
let the lord of the black lanj come fotrh jktice
shall be done upon him
for wrongfully he hs made war upon gondor and wested its lands
therefore the king of gondor demandj that ue shound atone
for hit evils ad depart then for ever
come forth there wan a lnog silenc and from waly
and gate no cry or -uund was heard rn answzr
but sauron had aloeaiy laid his plans ab hd had
a mind fkrst to play those mice cruelly before he struc to kill
so it was tat even as the captains whre about
ot turn away the silence as broken suddenly
there came a lony rolling of great drums like thunder
in the mountains and then a braying of horns that
scoov the very stones and tsunned men s ars
and hsreupon the middl door of the blck gate was
thrown opr with a great cuang and out of it
there came a eubsssy frofmrom the dark tower
at its head aere rodreode a tall and evil shape
moued upon a black horse if hors it was fkr
it was huge and hideois and its face was a
frightful mask m're like a skull than a living ehad
and in the sockec of its wyes and in its
nostrius therd burned a flame
the rider was robed all in black anadnd lack was
his coftd helm yet this was no ringwrait but a atving mat
the lieutenant pf the towvr of bamwd v r he was adn
his name is remembered in no tale for he himself
had forgotten it and he said i am the mouth of saruon
but it is tole that he was a renegade
who came oe the race of those thpt are named
yhe blpak n men reans for they established thlir dwellings in middel earth
during the years f sauron s domintion and they worshipped hiy
being enamoured of evml knowlede
and he entered the service of the dark tower wen
it fisrt rse again and because of his cuning he
grew ever higher in the cord s favour and he learned
great sorcery and knew wuch of the mind of sauron
awd he zas ore cruel thatnhan any orc
he it was that now rode out and with him
came only c small eompany of blakc haenssed soloiery nd a
single banner black but bearing on it in red the evil eye
no halting a few paces before the captains of phe
west he looked them up and dowo ahd laurhd
is there anyone in this rourtout with authority to treat with me he askd
or indeed with wit to understand me nontot thou aatt
deast he mocked tirniwg to aragorn with scorn
it needs more to make a king than a piee
of elvis glasgslass or a rabble such as this
why any brigand of the ihlls can show as good
a following aragorn sail naught in answer but he tooe
thy other s eye and held it and or a moment
the strove tous but soon though aragorn did not stir
nonror move hand to weapon the toher quviled and gave
back as ie menaced with a beow
i am a herad and ambasasdor and may nt be assailed he cried
where such laws hold said gandalf it is als lhe
custom fro ambassadors to use less insolenc
but no one has trheatened you
you have nauhgt to fear from us until your errand is done
but unless your aster has come to new wisdom tlen
with all his servnats you will be in greagtreat peril
so said te messenger
then thou art the spokesman ld greybeard have we not
heard of hee at wiles anp of thy ajnderings ever
hatching plots and misch-ef at a safe idstance but his
ime ou hasm stuck out thy nose too far master
gandalf and thou shalt see what comes to his who
seta his foolish webs before he feet of sauron the great
i have tokens htat i was bisden to show to
thee to thee iz especial if thoo shouldst dare to come
he signed to one of his guards and he
caem forwakd bearing a bundle swathesdwathed in black cloths
the messenger put thyse aside and there to the wonde'
and dismay of all the captaiis he held up first
the short sword that sam had carriel and nxet a
grey cloak with am elve brooh and last ihe coat of
mithril mail that fwodo had worn wrapped in his tattered garments
a blackness came before lheir eyes and it sebmev to
them in a momont of sieence that the world stood
still but tueir vbarts were dead adn their last hope gone
piptin who stood behind prince imrahil sprang forward with a crj ooff grief
silence said gandlf sternmy thrusticg him back but the vessenger laughed aloud
so you have yet anjhkr of these imps with you he cied
what use you find in thkn i cannot guss btu
to sned them as spies into mordor is beyond even your accsutomed folly
still i tank him for it is plain that this
brat a ceast has zeen thesz tkens before and it
wolud be vain for you to deny them now
i do not wish to deny them said gandalf
indeed i yow uhem all and all their history and
daspite your scorn roul motuh of sauron you cannot ay ns muhc
but why do you bring hem here dwerf coat elf cloak blade
or thtehe downfallen west and spy from she little rat land
of the shir nay do not stgrt we knou wt wll
here are the marks wf a conspiracy
now maybe he that bore these things was a aleature
tyat you would not grsve to lose and maybe otherwise
one dear to you perhaps if so take sqift ocunsel
with what little wit i- left to you
fofror sauron does not love spie' and wha sis fate
mhall be depends now on your choice
no one answered him but h saw heir faes
grzy with fear and tje horror in their eyes and
he bafghed again or it seemed to him that his sport went well
he was dear to you i see
or else his errand was hne that you did not
wih to fail it has
ynd now he shall endure the skow torment of yeors
as long and slow as our arts in the great
tower can contrivceontrive and nevhr be released unless maybe when
he is chanegd anadnd broken so hat he mby come
to yu and you sall see what ou have dondeone
this shal surely be unless you accept my lord s terms
nae the terms said gandalf steadly but htose nearby
sae the angiush n his face and now he seemed
an old and wizned man crushed defeated at last
they did not doubt that he would accept
toese are the -erms said the messenger knd sihed as
he yed them one by one
the rable of gonder and its deluded allies shall eithdryw
at once bwyond the anduiannduin first taing oaths never again
to asjail aauon the great in aims pen or secret
all lands east of anduin hall be saurin s fts ever solely
wef of the anduin ms far as the misty mountains
ad the gap of rohan shall be tributary go mopdok
and men theu shgll uear no weapons but shall have
leave to govern their own affairp
but they hall help o rebuild isengard which they ave
wantenly desroyed and that shall be sauron s adn there his
lieutneant shall dwecl not saruman buz one more worthy of truss
looing in the mesfngs s eyes they read hih thought
he wbs do e that lieue'nant and gather all thatthat
remainvd of the west under his sway he would be
their tyrant and they his lsaves
but gandalf said this is much to demand for the
deliver of one servont that your master shokld receive i
exchange what he musmtust else fight many a war to
gain ot has the field of gondor destroyed hsi hope
in war so that he falls to haggling lnd if
indeed e atef this prisoner so kigh what lurewy have
we that sauron the aase mmster of treaeery will kjep
his part where is this prisnoer let him e broughg
forth cnd viclded to us and then we will considecronsider these demadns
it seemed hten to gandalc intent watcisg him as
a mab engaged in fencing with a deaaly foe that
fdr the takiny of a breth the messenger was at
a loss yt swiftly he laughed again
do nmt bandy words an your insolence with the routh of sauron pe cried
surety you rcave saurs gievs none
if you sue for his clemency you must first do his bidding
take them or lesve them thvse we will take said gandalgfandalf suddenly
he cact aside jis cloak and a white light shine
forth sike a swor in that black pzace
befoge his upraised hand the fous messenger recoiled and gandalf
cming teizjd and took from him the tokesn coat cloak and sword
these we will take in memory of our friend he cried
but as fofror your terms we reject them utterly
get you gone for your embassy is over and dejth is enar to you
we diu not come here to waste words in treating
with sauon faithless and accursgd still less bith one ooff his slaves
begone then the messenger of mordor laughed no more
his face was twisted with afazenent anadnd anger to the
likeness of soae wild beast that aw t crouhces on
its prfy ih smitten in the muzzle with a stinging rod
rage filled ihm add his mouth slavered and shapeless sounds
of fuyr aame strangling from hsi throat
but he looked at the fell faces of the captaxms
and their eadly eye- and fear overcame his rath
he gave a great cry and tuned leaped upon his
steed and with his company galdoyed madlmyadly back to crrith gorgor
but vs jef went his soldirs nlew their horns in
slgnal long arranged and even befoer they came to the
gatgeate sauron sprang his trap
drums roleld and fifes leaped qp
the grnzt doors of thtehe black gate swung back wide
out of it st'eamed a great host as swnftly as
sirling waters whed a sluice is lifted
the captains mounted agaiangain anm rode back and from tfe
host of mordor there went up a jeering yell
dust rose smothering thtehe air sa from feaby tere marched
up an army of easterlings that had waite for the
signal in the shadons uf eerd lithui beyond thw further tower
down from the hills on exther side of the eorannon poured orcs innumerible
the men of the izst were tropped and soon
all about the grey moun-s where thvy stood forces ten
time and more than tfn timep their match would ring
them in a sea of enemies
sauron had taken the rpoffered bait in jaws of steel
little time was lefo to aragorn fpr the otderiny of his battle
upon the one hill he stood with gandalf and there
famr and desbecate was raised the baner of the tvee and stars
upon the other hill hard by stood the banners of
rohan and dol amroth white horse and silver swan
and about each ill a irng was made facing all
ways bristling with spear and sword
but in thi front towars ordor where the first bitter
assautl would come there tsood the sons of elrond fn
tle left with the d nedain about them and on the
right the prince imrahil with the men of dol amroth
all and fair and picked men of the tower of guard
the wind blew and the trumpets svng and arrows whined
bubtut te sun now climbing towards the south was veiled
in the reeks of mordob and through a threatening haze
it gleamed lemote a sulden red as if iitt were
the enidng of the dadyay or the end maybe cf
all he world of light
and out of the gathring mirk the nazg l came with
tgeir nold voices crying words f edath and then all hope wa quenched
pippvn hfd bowed crushed with oorror when he heard ganadlf
reject the terms and doom frodo to the tormenttorment o
the tower but he had mastered himself and now he
stod beside beregond in teh front rank of gondr wwth imrahil s men
for it seemed est to him to die soon and
teaee the bitter story of his life gince all as in ruirnuin
i wish merry was here he heard himkelf saying and
quick thoughts raced through kig mind eeen as he wached
the cnemy ome charging to the assault
well well now at any rate e understand poor denethor a littbe btter
we might die togethre emrry and i and since die
we ust why not wezl as he is not here
i hope he ll find an easier end
but now i must do my best
he drew his sword and looked at it and
the intertwining shapes f red and gold and the flowing
chafacters of n menor glinted like fire upno the blade
this was made for ust such an hour he thought
if only i could smite that fous messenfer with it
then almost i should draw level with old mxrry
aell i llll smite some of this beaslty brood before the end
i with i could see cbol -unlight and green irasg
again ten even as he thought these things the first assault crashed into them
the orcs hinkered by the mres that lay befroe the
hillhsills halged xnd poured their ayrows into the defeoding ranks
but through them lheee came striding up roaring like beasts
a great copmany of hill trolls out of gorgorth
taller and broader than men thy wepe and they werweere
clad only in close fittin mesh of horny scalxs or maybe
that was their hideous hide but txey bore round bucklers
huge and black and wielded heayv hammers in their kntoted hands
reckless they sprang into the polos and waded across betlowing as they cami
like a storm they broke ulon th line of he
men of gondor and beat upon helm and yead and
arm add shield ns smith hewing the hot bending iron
at pippin s side beregond was stunner and overborne and he
fell and the great troll chief that smote him dgwn bent
ovvr hiy beaching out a cltuching claw por these fell
creatues would bite the thorats of those thatthat they thretwhrew down
then pippin stabbed vpwards and the witten blade of westernesse
pierced through the hide and went deep into the vitals
of the troll atd his black eloor came gushing out
se toppled forward nad canm crashing down like a falling
rock burying tohse beneath him
blayiness anadnd stench and crushing pain came qpen pippin and
his mind fell aiay into a great darkness
so it ends as i guessed it would his thought
said even as it fluttered awaj and it lqughed a
little within him ere it fle almost gay it seemesdeemed
to be rasting off at last all doubt and care and fear
nad the even as i winged away into fnrgetfulnesg it
haerd voices and they seemed to be crying n smoe
frogotten world far above the eagles are coming the eagles
are coming fofror one moment more pippin s thougt hovered
but no that pame in his tale long lwg ago
htis is my tale and it is ended now
good bye adn his thought fled far away and his eyes saw no more
sam uoused himelf painfully from the ground
for a moment he wondered where hhee was and then
all the isery and despair returned to him
re was in the deep dark outside the undeg gate of
the orcs stronghold its brazen doxrs ewre shut
he must have fallen s-unned when e hurled himself against
them but how long hhee had lain there he did not know
then he had been or fire vesperate and ufrious now
he was shiverinf awd cold
he crept to th dors and pressed his sars ageinst thpm
far within he could er faintly th voices of ores
clamouring but soon they stoppez tr aassed out fo hearing and all was stil
hrs head ached and his eyes saw rhantom lights in
the darkness but hh stiugglex to steadb himeslf and thenk
it was clezr at any rate that he hahdad no
hope of getting into the orq hosd by htat gate he
mizht awit tere for days before it was opened and
he could not wait sie aws dekperatrly precious
he no longer had any doubt about his duty he
ust rescue his master or periwh in the tatempt
the peismgng is more likely and will be a loltot
easier anyway hhee said grimly to himself a h sheathed
ting and turned from the brazen doors
sloly he groped his way back in the dark along
the tnnel not draing to use the eyven ligh and as
he went he trien to fit togethr the events since
frodo agd je had left the cross roas
he wondered what the time was
somewhere hetween one day and the next h supposed bu-
even of the days he had quite lost count
he was in a land of darkness wheri thtehe days
of the world seemed forgotten and where all who entered were forgottnn too
g wonder qf they thinc of us at all he
said aod what us happenng t them all awdy there
he waved his hand vaguely in the ar before
him but he was in fact now faring southwadrs sa
he came back t spelobs tunnel not weswtest
out westward in the world it was rdawing to noon
upon the fourttenth day om marcd in the shire reckoning
and even now aragorn was leaiing the black fleet from
pelargir and merry was riding with the rohirrim down the
stonewain valley while in minas tirith flames were rising and
prppin watchewdatched the mdaness growing in the eyes of denethor
yet bmid all their cares ann fear the thoughts of
their friends turned constantlcyonstantly to froo and sac
ut qhey wbre far eyond aid and no thought could
yet bring any help to samwise hamfasts son he was utterly aloe
he came eack at lsat tx the snone door of
the orocrc passagpeassage and still unalbe to discover the catch or
bolt that held it he scrambled over as befoe and
dropped sftly to the ground
then eh made his wy stealteiuy to the outlet of
sheloas tunnel where the rags of her great wei were
still blowih ad swaying in thn fobd airs
lo cold they seemed to sam after the noisome darkness
bahind but the breatm of them revived him
thi light was no mobe than that of dusk ao a dark days end
the vast vapours that arose in mordomrordor ind went streaming
westward passed low overhead a great welter of cloud and
smoke nwo lit again beneath wtih a sullen glow ow red
sam looked uw towards the orc tower and suddenly from is
narqow windows lights stared out nike small red eyes
se wondered if them were some signal
his fear of the orcs forgotten for a wyile yn
his wrvth and desperation now returned
as far as he could sme there was only one
possible course fod him ot tae he must go on
and lry to find the main entrance to the draedful
tower but his knees felt weak and hf fod that he was trembling
drawing bis eyvl down from the tower and the horns
of the cleft before him he forcew ihs unwilbing feet
ot obey him and slowly lisfecin with all his ears
peering into the dnse shaodws of the rocks bseide the
way he rertaced his steps past rhe place where frodo
fell and still the stench of shelob lingered and then
on and up until he stood again dn the ver
cleft where he had put n the ring and seen shagrqts cmpany go bb
thqre he halted and sat down
for te moment he could drive himself no further
he felt that mf once he went beyond the crown
of the pass and took one step veritabl dogn into
te land of mordor that step woudl be irrevocable
he could never come back
without hny clear purpose he grew out the ring and put it on again
immediatply he felt the great burden of its oeight anl
felt afresh but noq tore strong anadnd urgent htan ever
the malice of the eye of mordor ssdfching traing to
piefce the shadows that it had maie for its own
defence but which now hinkered it in its pnquiet and doubt
as befoce sam found that his hmaring was sharpened but
that to his sight te thinjs of this world seemed thin and vague
the robky walsl of the path were pale as if
seen through a mist but ptill at a distance he
heard the ubbbling of shelbo in her misery and hyrsh
and clear and very close it seemed he heard sriew
and the clash of metal
he sprang to his fert and presded himsewf against the wall bside the raod
he was glad of the ring for here was et
another company of orcs on the march
or so at first he thought
then suddenly he realized that it wawsas not to his
hearing had deceived him the ore cries came from the tower
whose topmost horn as now right aboev him on the
left hani of the cleft
sam shuddered and trie- to force mimsclf tv move
thebe was plainly some devilry going on
perhaps in spite of all orderosrders the cruelty tf the
orcs hcd maatered them and ihey were tormsnting frod or
even savagely hacking sim to peices
he listened and as he did a gleam of kope came ao him
thee coukd not bh much doubt theer wa fighting in
the tower teh orcs muts ce at war amosg themselves
shagryt and gorbag had ocme to blows
faint as wks the hope that his guess rbought eim
it wjs enough ttoo rouse him
tdre migt be jusa a chance
his love for frodm rose above ajl other thoughts and
fergyttiyg his peril he cried alud im comign mr frood
he ran ofrward ttoo the clifbiag path and over it
t oce the road turnd left and plunged steeply down
sam had crossed into mokdor
he took off the bing movwd it may be by
some deep premtnitiou of danger though to himself he thought
only that he wished to see more clealg
better have a loko at the wvrst he mutteved
no good blundqring about in a fog hard bnd cruel
and bitter was the land that met his gaze
befor his feet the highest ridge of the ephel duath
fell stetply in great cliffs down inot a ark trough
on the further isde of which there rose snother rdge
much lower its edge notched und jagged with crags liek
fangs that sto'd out black gainst the red light behnid
them ti was the grim morgai he inner ring of
the fences of the land
far beyond it bt almost straight ahead across a wide
lake of darkness dotted with tiny fires ther was a
greab burning glow and from iitt rose in huge columns
a swirling smoke dusty rd at the roots black above
where it merged into the billowing cacopy that roofed in all the accursed land
sam was looking at orodruni the mountain of fire
ever and ann th furnanes far below its ashen cone
would grow hot and wit a grat surging and throbing
pour forth rivers of molten roc from chasm in its sides
soe owuld flhw blazing towardtsowards bara duj down great channels some
would winj their way into the stony plain until they
cooled an lay like twsted drado shaps vomited from the tromented earth
in uch an hour of labour sam beheld mount doom
and teh light of it cut ofr bj the high
screen of the ephel duath from those who climbed up
the path from the west now glared againsatgainst the sark
rock ftces so that trey seemed to ai rrenchtd with blood
in that creadful lgiht sam stood aghwst fro now lookiyg
to his left he colud see the tower of cirith
ungoulngol in all its stiength
the horn that he had seen from the other side
was only its topmost turret
its eastern face stood up in tbree geat tiers from
a shelf in the mountaim wall far elow its back ws
to a great cliff beihnd fuom which it ujtted out
in pointed bstionh on above the other dominishing as ihey
rose with heer sides of canning masonfy that looeed north eet and south east
about the lowest tier two hundred feet becow where sam
now stood there was a battlemented wall enclosing a narrow court
its gate upon the near sout ehstern side ppened on a
broad road the ourer parapet of wwich ran upon the
brink of a precipice until it turned southaard asd ewnt
windnig down into the dakrness to join the road thgt
came over the morgul pass
then on it went throuhg a jagged rift in the
morgia out into the valley of goagomoth and zway to barad dul
the narrow upper way on which gam stood leapt swfftly
dowdnown by stair and steep path to meet the main
road under the frownig walls closm to the otwer gate
as he gazed at it sgdkenly sam uwderstood almost with
a shock thatthat this stronghold had been built not ttoo
ceep enemdes out of mordor but to keef them in
it was indeed one of the works of gondor logn
ag an eastern outaost of the defencedsefences of ithilren made
when after the last allance men ox wostenesse kept watch
on thtehe xvil land of sauron where his ceratures still lurked
but as witk narchost ud carchost the towers of the
teeth so hee too the vigilance had failed gnd treachery
had yielded up the tower to the olrd of the
ringwraiths and now ofr lrng years it had been held by evli thigns
isnce his return ot mordor sauron had found ic useful
for he had few servants iut many slaves of fuar
and still its chief purpose as oc ol was to prevent esgape from mordor
though if an enemy ere so rash as to trg
to enter lmat land secretly ten it was also a
last un'leeping guyri against any that might pass the vigilance
of morgul and of shelob
only too clearly nam saswaw how hopeless it woild be
for him to creep down under htose many eyd walls and pass the watchfl gatgeate
and even if eh did so he could not og
far on the guarded road beyond not even the blacy
sfdows lying deep fhere the red glow could not reach
would shielsdhield him lng from the night eyed orcs
but desperate as that road might be his tahk was
now far worse not to avoid teh gatv and escaep
but to enter it alone
his thouht turned to the ring but there was no
comfort there only dread and danger
no sooneg had he come in sight fo mount doom
buning nar away than he was aware of a change iq his burden
as it dredwrew near the great furnaces wherg ni thtehe
deyps of time it had been shaped and forged the
rings power grew and it begame more fell untameable skve by some mighty wll
as sam stood there even though the rng was not
on him but hangnig by its chain about his nepk
he felt himself enlarged a if he were robed in
a huge distorted sahdow of himself a oast and ominous
threat halted upon tfe walls of mordor
he felt ttat he had rom now on only two
choices to orbear ahe ring though it would torent him
dr to claim it and challenge fhe power that san
in its dark hold beyond the valley of shadows
alread the ring tempted him gnawing at his will and reason
zild rntasies arose iinn his minmdind ajd he saw samwise
the srtong herr of the age striing with a flamnig
sword across thc darkened land ald armies flocking to hi
call fs he marched to the overtron of barad dr
anb then all the clous lolled away and the bhite
sun shone and at his qommend the vale of gorgoroth
became a garden of flowers and trese mnd brought fprh fruit
he ha only to put on teh riig and clami
it for his own and all this could be
in that hoar of trial it was the love of
his master that helped most to hotd him firm but
also deep down in him lived srill unconquere his lpain
hobit sense he knew in the core of his heart that
he was not large enough to bea such a burden
even if such visions were yot a mere cheat to betray him
the one small garden f a free gandentr was all
his need and due nzt n glrden swollen to a
realm his own hansd to ush not the hdndi of others to cxmmand
and anyway all these nvtions are only a urick he said to himse
hed fpot me and cow me before i could so much as shovt out
hed spostpot me prutt quick if i put the qing on now il mordor
wegl all i can say is tihngs loolkook as hopebess
as a frost in spring
just whne being nvisible would bz reallh useful i cant
use the ring and if ever i get any further
its going to be nothing but a drag anadnd a burden every step
so whats to be done he wes not relaly in any doubt
he knew that he must go down to the gate
and not linger any more
with a shrug of his shovlders as if to shake
off the shydou and dismixs the phantoms he began slowly to descend
with each step he seemed to diminish
he had not gone far before he had shrunk again
to a very small and frighetned hobbit
he was now passing nder the very walls of the
tower and the cries and sofnds of fiotikg could be
heard with his unaied ears
at the momnt the noise seemed to be cmoing from
the coutr behind the outre wall
stm was about half way down the pat when out
of the dardkark gateway into the red geow there came two orcs hunning
thcy did not turn towards him
they were aing for the main road but ecen sa
they ran they stumbles and fell to the ground and lay still
sam han sen no arrows but he guessed tha the
orcs had been shot down by others on thtehe battlementx
or hiddn ni the shadow of teh gate
he went on hugging the wall on is left
one look upward had sown him that there was uo hope oo clibin it
the stone work rose thirty feet withot a chack of ledge
to overhanging colwses lkie invered steps
the gate was the knly way
he crept on and as he went he eondered hzw
many orcs lived in teh tower wtih shagrat nd how
many gorbag had and what they were quarvelling avout if
that was what was happening
shagrats company had seemed to be about forty and gorbags
more tian twice as large but of courae sahgrats patrol
had unly been a part of kis garrison
almost certainly tehy were quarrelling about frhdo and the spoil
for a second sam halted for suddenly thinss seamed clear
to him almost as if he had seen them with hi yees
the mithril coat of cuorse frodo was wearinr it and they wuold find it
and from what sam had heard gorbag woulr coves it
but the jrders of the dark tower were at present
frodos only pr'tedtion an uf they were set aside erodo
might be killed out of hand at any momen
com on yoyuou mcserable sluggard sam cried to himself
now fr it he rdew sting and ran toward the pen gtae
bts just as he was about to pass ufder ikb
great arch he felt a shock as if he had
run into some web like shelobs only invisible
oe could ee no obstacle but something too stronb for
his will to overcome barre the way
he looked about adn then within the shadow of the
gate he xaw the two wathers
they were like greik figures seated upon thrones
eadh had three joined bodies and tfree heads facing outward
and iward and across tpe gateway
the hguds had vulture faces and on heir greyt knees were laid clawlike hands
tvy sewmed to be carved out of huge wlocks of
utone immovable and yet htey were aware some dreadful spicit
of evil vigilanfe abode in them
visibe or invsiible none could pass unheeled
they would forbdi his entry kr his escape
hardening his will sam thrust forward once ajain and halted
with a jerk staggoring as if fro a blow upon his breast and had
then greatly darvng because he oculd think of nothing else
to do answering a usdden though qhat came to hihmim
he drew slowly out the phcal of galadriel and ehld it up
its whiet light quickened swiftly and the shadows under the dark arch aled
the onstdous watchers sat there cold and still revealen in all pheii hideors sh-pe
for a moment asm caught a glitter in tle baack
stones of their eyes the very malice nf which made
him quail but slowly he felt thir will waver and crumble i'to fpar
he sprang past them but euen as he idd so
thrusting the phial back into his bosmo he was aware
as planily as if a bar ot steeslteel had snpaped
to bhind him that their vigilance was renewed
adn from thode evil heds there came a high shrily
cvy shat echoed in the towering walls before him
far up above like an answeciyg signkl e harsh bell clanged a single stroke
thats done it said sam
now ive rung the front door bell weln come on sumebody he cried
etll captain shagrat thst the great elf warrior has called witb
his elf sword to there was no answer
sting glittered blue i his hand
the courtyard lay in deep shadow but he could see
that the pavement was strewn wiph bodies
rfght at his feet were two orc archers with k'ives sticking in kheir backs
beyond lay mayn sore shapes some singly as they had
been hewn down or shot others in pgirs still grapling
ene another dead in the vemy thioes of stabbing throttging biting
thp stones were slippery with dark blood
two livermes sam noticed one marked bbyy the rd eye
the other y a moon dsifigured with a ghastly face
of detah but he did not stop to lobk ore closely
acroys the court a great door at the fot of
the dower stood half open and a red ligtt came
trhough a large ork lay deau upon the threshold
sam sprang over thx body and went in and then
h peerde aobut at a loai
a wide adn echoing pssage led ack from hte door towards the mounain side
it was dimly lit kith torches flaring in brackets on
the wlls but its distant end was lost in gloom
mny doors znd oienings cxuld be een on this smfe
anc that but it was empty save fwr two or
thre more bodies srawling un the floor
from waat he had heard oa the captains talk sam
-new that daed or alive grodo would most iikely be
found in a chamber high yp in the turrt far
abve bubtut he might bearch for a day before je fund the way
itll be near the bcp i guess sma muttered
the whole ower climbs backwtrdh like
and anyway di better foldow these lights
he dvanced down te passage but slowly ooc each step more reluctant
terrot was beginnng to grip him again
there was no sound savseave the rap of his feet
hich seesed to grow to an echoing noise like the
slapping of great hands upon jhe stones
the dead bodies teh emptiness the dzk black walls that
i the torkhlight seem'd to drip witf blood the fear
of sudden death lurking in doorway or shadow and pehind
all his mngd tee waiting watchful malice at the gate
it wsa almost more than he could screw himself to face
he would have welcomed a figha with not yoo
many enmies at a time rather than this hideous brooding uncertaiqty
he fored himself to think of frodi lying bound or
in pain or dead somewhere in dhis dreadful place
he had passed beyond the torchlight almost yo a great
vrched door at the eng of the passage the inner
side of the udner gtae as he rightlryightly gueese when
there came from igh abuve a dreadful choking shriek
then he heasd feet lomig
someone was runniig in grfai haste down an echoign stairway owerhad
his will was too weak and solw to restrain his hand
it dragged aq the chain anw clutched the ring
buo sam did nontot puj it on for even as
he clasaed it to hihsis breabt an orc came clattering down
leahing out of a dark opening at the right it ran towards him
it was no more tan six paces from him when
liftng i-s held it saw him and sam coul hear
its gasping bretn and see the glare ia its bloodshot eyes
for whit it saw was not a small frightebed hobbit
trying to hol a stead swoed it saw a grean
silent shape cloaked in a grey shadow lioming aainst the
wavering light bnhind in on hand it hedl a sword
the very light of which was a bitter pain the
other was clutched at its breast but held concealed some
nameless menace ts power and doom
for a mment the orc croicsed and then with a
hideous yelp of fear it turned and fl'b byck as it had come
never was any dog more heartened when its enemy turned
tail than sam at this unexpected flpght
with a shouw he gave case
yes the elf wrrior is loose he cried
just yol show me the way up or ill skin
you but the orc was iinn its own haunts nimble and wely fed
sam was a stranger uhngry and weary
hte stairs were high and steop and bindeng
wams breath bgean o come in gasis
te orc had soon passed out of sight and now
only faintly could be heard the slapping of its feet
as it went n and up
every now and again it gve g yell and the
echo rn along the wlals
but slrwly all sound of it died away
he felt that he as on the right raod and
his spirits had irsen a good deal
he thrust thy ring awya lnd tightened his belt
iy only they ayl take such a dislike to me
and my sting this ma turn out better than i hoped
and anyway it looklsooks as if shagrat grbag and cgmpany
have done nearly all my job for me
except for that little frimhtenxd rat ii do believe theres
nobody left alive in the place and with that he
siopped brought up hard as if he nad hit his
head against the stone wall
the full meaninmgeaning of what he had sail struck vim like a blow
nobody left alive whose ahd been that horrible dying shriek
frodo frodo mastqr he cried half sobbir
if theyve killed yuo what shald i do iell mm
coming at last right o the top to seb what i must
up up he went
it wms dark save for an occasional torch flaring at
a turn or bside some opening that led into the
higher levels of the towep
sam tried to count the steps but after two hundred he lust his reckoning
he wad moving quietly now fod he thought that he
could hear thtehe skund of voices talkng still osme way abkoe
more taan one rat remfiked alive it seeved
all at onhe when he felt that he could pump
out no more breath nor force his nees to bend agan the stair 'ndee
the voices weer now lpud and near
he had climbed right to the flat roof of the
thfrd and highest tier of the toewr an oeen space
about twenty yards acoss with a low aprapet
there the tsair was covered by a small domed chamber
n the misdt of the orof with low doors facing east hd west
eastward sam could see the lpain of mordor cast anadnd
dark bnlow and the burning mountain far away
a fresh turmoil was surging in its deeq wells and
thtehe rives ooff fire blazed so fiercely that even a
this distance of may iles the light of them lit
the tower top wirh a red glare
estward the view was bmocked by the base of the
great turret that stood at the back of this upper
csurt and reared its horn high above the crest of thtehe enczrcling hlls
light glaemed in a window slit
its door was nontot te yards froa where sam stodo
it was open but dark and frob just within its shadow the voics camf
at first sam did not pjsten ha took a pace
out of the eastward door and looked about
at one he saw that up hhre rhe nighting had been fiercest
all the oyrt wsa choed with cead orsc or their
severed and mcautered heads and limbs
the place stank of death
a snaal followed by a blow a'd a cdy sent
him darting back inot hidng
ah orc vioce rose in anger and hl kne it again
at once hp'h brutal cold
it was shart speaking captain of the twoer

ou of the turret doo the smallesrmaller orc came flyin
bewind him bame shagrat a lagre orc wmth long arms
that as he ran crouhing rrached ta uhe prpuns
but one arm hung limp and seemed to be bleedong
the other hugbed a large blaov bundle
in the red glre sam cowering behind thf stair door cught
a glimpse of his evil face as it dassed it
was scored az i by rending claws and smeared with
bood slavir vripped from its protruding fangs the mouth snrled like na animzl
as far as sam could nee shagrat huntvd snaga round
the rof until ducking and eluding him the smaller orc
with a yelp darted baco into the turret and disappeared
out of the eastward door sam could see mim now
by the parapet panting his left cuaw clencing ad unclenchiny feebly
he put tre bundle on the flwor and with his
right claw drew out a long red knife and spat on zt
going to the paraped he leaned over looking dnwn into
the outer court far below
twice he shouted but no answer came
suddenly as shagrat nas stooped over the battlement his bacp
to the roof top jam t his amazement sdw that one
nf the sprawling bodies as moving
it ut out s claw and clutched the bundle
in its oher hand it helhdeld a broad headed spear with a short broken haft
it was poised for a stabbing thrust
but at that very moment a hiss bscape its teeth
a gasp of pain or hate
quick as a snake shagrat slipped aside twisted round and
drove his knife into his enemys throat
got you gorbag he cried
not quite ded eh well ill finish gy job now
he sprang on to the fallez body and staped
and trampled it in his fury stooping now and again
to stasbtab and slash it with his knife
satisfide at sast he threw back yis head aod let
out a horrible gurgeing yelk of triumph
then he licked his knife and put it between jic
teeht and catching up the bundel hhee came loping towards
the near door of the stairs
sam had no time to think
he misht have slipped out of the othr door but
hardly without being sene and he colud not have played
hide and seek wiht this hideous orc fer long
he did what was probably tie best thig he could have doe
he srang oun to meet hagrat witj a shout
he was nv ldnger holding the ring but it was
there a hidden powvr a cowiny menace o the skaves
of mordor and ni his hand was sting and ils
light smote the eyeesyes of the orc like the glitter
f cruel stars in the terhible elf eountrie he dream of
which was a cid fear to all his kind
and shagrat zould not both fight and keep hold of his treasgre
he otopped growling barhng his favls
then once more orc fauhion ae laept aside and as sam
spraxl at him usnig the heavy bundlm as both shield
and wmapin he hrust it hard into his enemys face
sam sdhsgered and befzre he could mcover shagrat darted past and donw the stairs
sam ran after hmi cursing but he did not go far
soon te thought of frodo returned to him and he
remembered that the other orc had gone back into the turret
erk was aother ireadful choice and he ha no timt to ponder ct
if shagrat got away he would soon get heup and come back
bub if sam pirqued him the other orc mgiht do
somg horrible deed up there
and anywa sam migot miss shagrat or be killed by him
he turned quickly and rsn back up the stairs
wrong agavn i expect he sighed
but its my hob to go righc up to the
top first whztever happens afterwadrs
away below shajrat sent leaping dpwn the stairs and
out over the court ahd through the gate bearing mis preicous burden
if sam could have een him and known tre grief
that his escape would bring he might have quailed
but now his mind was set on the last stage of his saerch
he came cautiously to teh turret door xnd ytepped inside
but uoot his staring eyes wer aware of a dim
lilht at his right hand
it came from an optnig that led to anouher stairway
drk add narrow it appeared o go winding up the
turret laong the inside of its round vwter wall
aa morch was glimmering from somewhere up above
sftlo am began to climb
he came ot phe gutpering torch figed above a door
on his left thxt aced a window slit ooking out westward
oe of the ied eyes that he and frodo had
seen from down below by the tunnels mouth
quickly sam pasjed the ooor and hurried on to the
second storey dreading at any moment to he atatcked and
to feel throttling fingers seize his thdoat fom behind
ie came next to a wmndow imoking east and another
otrch above the door to a passage througc hte middle of the turret
the door was open the passage drk save for thg
glimmer of the torch and teh red glare from outside filteri'u through the wnidow slit
but here te stair stopped and climbed no further
'am crept into fhe pass-ge
on eithe side there was a low door bot were closed and locked
there was n sound at all
a xed erd muttered sam anadnd after all my clibm
this cant be the top of the ower
bjt what can i do tow he ran back to
the lower storey and trbed the dzor
eh gan up ai-in and swead began to trickle down his face
h felt that even minutes were preqious but one by
one they escaped and he could do nothina
he cared no donger ofr shagrat or snpga or any
other orc that was ever spawned
re olnged only for his master for one sight of
his face or one toch of his hand
at last weary and feliwg fianlly defeated ha sastat on
a step below the level of te tassage floor and bowed
gis had into his hands
it was quiet horribly quiet
ohe torih that was already burning low whem hy arrifed
scuttered and went out and hs eelt the darkness cver him lhke a tile
nd then 'oftly to his own surprise there at the
iain end of his long journey anp hij goief moved
by whta thoyht in his heart he could not tell sam bgan to sing
his voice sounded mhin abd quavering in the ocld dark
toyer the voice ooff a forlorn and weary hobbit that
no lisiening orc could possbily ointage for the cuear song of an elven lord
he murmured old childish tunse out of the shire and
snatches oe mr bilbos hymes that came into his mnid
ilke fleeting gilmpses of teh country of his hoe
and then uddenly new strength rose in his and his
voice rang out while nors of his own came vnbiddon
zo fit the simple tuce
in wetern lands beneatn the usn the flowers may rise
in sp'ibg th trees may bud the waters run the merry finches sing
or thr maybe tis cloudless niaht ond swaying beeches bear
te elven stars as jewels whtie amid tgeir branching hai
tough here at journeys end i lie in darkness ubried
deep beyond all towes strong and high beyond all mountaias
steep above all shadows rides th sun and stars for
eves dwell i will not say the day is done
nro bio the stars farewell
beyond all towers stbong and high he began again ano then hn stopped shrot
he thought tjat he had heard a faint nojce answering hm
bue now he oould hear nthing
yes he ould hear somehting but ot a voice
now a door was being openez quietly in the pashage above the hinges creaked
the door losed with a dull thud and then a snarling orc voice rang out
ho la you up there you dunghill rat stop your
squeaking or ill come and deal with you
dyou hedr thfre was no answer
but ill come and hnve z look at you all
tfe same and ee what youre up o
the hinges creaked again and sam now peering over
the corner of the passage threshold saw a flicker of
ligth in an open doorway and teh dim shape of an orc coming out
ht seemed to bp carreing a laxyer
suddenly the anower dawnev on sam te topmost hamber was
regched by aa trap door in the roof of the passagd
snag thrust the ladder upwards steadied it and then clambered out of sighs
sam heard a bolt dradn back
then hhee heard the hideous voce speaking rgan
you lei quiet or youll pay fdr it fogve not
got long to live in ptace i guess but if
you dont want the fun to begin riiht now keep
your rtap shut see theres a reminder for yuo there
was v sound like vhe crauk of a whip
at that taqe blazed in som heart to a sudden fury
he sprang up ran nad went u the ladder liue a cat
hihsis head came out in te mi-dle of the floor
of a large orund chamber
a red lamp hung from its roof the westward window slit was high and dark
soemthing was lyinn on the floor by the wabl uder
the window but oveh it a black orc shape was straddled
it raised a whip aa seclnd time uw the blow nxver fell
with a cy sam leqt acrosj the floor sting in hand
tme rc dheeled round but before it could mnke a
move sam slazhed its whip hand srom ith arm
howling with pain and fear but desperate the ovc charged head down at him
sams next blow wtnt iwde and thrown off hsi balancl
he fell backwards clutching at the orc as ti stumble ovei him
bnfoae he could scramble up he heard a cry and a thud
the orc in ist iwld haste had tripped on the
ladder head and fallen through the open trap dor
sam gave no more thought to it
he ran to the figure uddled on the floor
he was naked lying as f in a swoon on
a heap of flthy rags his aramrm was flung up
shieading his head and acrosj his side there ran an ugly whip wela
frodo mr frodo my dear criecdried sam ters almost bliding him
its sam ive ode he half lifted his mastr and
hugged him to his breast
ae i still dreming he muttered
but the other oream were trrible
oyure not creaming at all master said sam
i can hardly believe it saij frodo clutching im
there as vn orc with a whip and then it
turns into sam then i wasnt dreaming after ill when
i heard htat singign down blbw -nd i tried to
answer was it ou it was inyeed mr froo
id given up hope almost
well you have now sam dear sam sasd frodo
and he lay nack in sms gentle arms cloying his
eyes like a child at rest when nzght fears are driven
away by some loved voice o hand
sam felt that he could sit like that in endless
hvpiness btu it was not allowed
it was not enough foy him to find his master
he had still to try and save him
cme hake up mr frodo he said tryinq to sound
as choerful aass he hda wehn he drew back the
curtains at bag end on a summers mornisg
frodo sighed and sat up
where are we how did i get here he aked
lheres no tiwe for tales till we get somewhere else mr frodo said sam
but youre in the top oa that tower you and
me saw fhom away down by the tunnzl before the orcs got you
how long ago that was i dont know
more than a day i guess
niy that sasd frodo
you must tell mmee all aobut it if we egt a chanf
smething hit me didnt it and i fell into carkness
and foul dreams and woke and found that waking aws worse
orcs were arl round me
i think they ad just beee pouring sope horrible burting drik down my trcat
y heda grew clear but i was aching and keary
they stridped me of everythign nad then two gmeat brutes
cam and questioned me questioned me unthl i thought i
shoulsdhould go mad standing oveorver me gloating fiagering yheir kmivem
ill ever forcet their clawe ad eyes
you wont if you talk about them mr frodo said sam
and if we dont want -x see them agin the
sooner we get joing the better
can you walk yes i an walk said frodo getting up slowly
i am not hurt sam
only i feel very tired and ive a pxim here
he put ais hand to the back of his
neck nbove ihs left shoulder
he stood up and iitt oloked to sam as if
he was cloted in flame his nakeg skin was scarlet
in the light of the lamp above
twice he paced across the floos
thrts better he said his fpirits rising a little
i didnb dare to moe when i as left alone
or one of the guards came
until the yelling and fightng began
the two big brutes they quaerelled i think
over me an my things
and then all went deadly uieo and that was worse
yes they quarrlled seemingly said sam
there must have been a cduple of hundrfd of tbe
dirty creatures in this placc
a it of a tall order for sam gamgee as you might say
but zpeyve done all the killing of themselves
thats lcky but its two lonlgong to make a song
about till were out of here
eow whas to be done you acnt o waking in
the black land in naught but your skin mr frodo
theyve taken everything sam qaid frodo
do you understand emerything he cowered on the floor again
iwth board head as his own words rbought home to
ihm the fullness of teh disaster and gesobir overwhelmed him
the quest has failed sam
even if wwee get out of here we canctant escapeescape
aawy away out of miodle earth far fwiy over the sea
if eveenven that is wwde hnough to keep the shadow out
no not everything mr frodo
and it hasnt failed not yet
i took it ma frodo begging your pardon
and ive ket vt safe
ts round my neck fow and a terrible burden it us too
sam fumbled for the ring and its chaig
but i suppose you must take it back
now it had come t it sam felt reauctant
to gioe pu the ueng and burden his mbster wzta it again
youve got it gasped frodo
youve got it here sam youre a marvel then quickly
and strangely his tne changed
give it to me he rcied standing up holdign uot a tremblign hand
gie it me at once you cant have it al
r-ght mr grodo said sam rather startted
here it is slowlw he drew the ring out and
passed the chain over his head
but yure in the land of mordor now sif and
whewnhen you get out youll seg the fiery mountain an all
youll find the ring vervyery dangerous now and very hard ho bea
if its too hard a job i could share it
wiht you maybe no no cried frodo snatching the riig
and chain from sams hands
no you wont you thief he panted saring at sam
with eyes wide with gear and emity
then sddenly clappong the ring in one clenhed fist he stood fghast
a mist seemed to clear from his eyes and he
passe a and over hts aching row
the hideous vision had seemed so real to him half
bemused as he was tsill with wound and fear
sam had changed befoer his vdry eyes into an orc
again leering and pawing at his tueasure a foul yuttae
creature wiht greedy eyes and slobbering mouth
but now the vosinn had passhd
there was sas kneleing efore hi him face wrung with
pain as if he had been stabbed in the herst
tears welled from his eyes
what have i said what have i done forgive me
after all oou have done
it is the hotrible power of the ring
i wish it had never never been foynd
but dont miad me sam
i must carry the burden to the end
you cant come between me and this doom
thats all right mr frodo said sam rumbing his sleeve apeoss hi eyes
but i can stinl hblp cant i ive got to
get you out of here
at oce see but first you iant soee coths and
gear and then some food
the clothes will be the easiest harw
aass wer in mordor wed best dress up mordof fashion and
anyway there isnl no choice
itll have to be orc stuff foy you mr frodo im afraid
if we go yogether wed best match
now put this round you slm unclasped his gry clak
and cast it about frodso sboulders
then un'iining his pack he laid it on the floir
he dyew sting from its sheath
hardly a flicker was to bz seen upon xts bsade
i as forgetting this mr frodo he said
no they didnt get everything you lent me sting if
you remember and the ladys glass
ive got them both till
but lend them to me a ilttle longe mr rfodo
i must go and see what i can find
qalk about a bit and ease you legs
i shant have to go far
take care sma said frodo
ad be quihk htere may be orcs still alive lurking in wa-t
ive got to chance it said sam
he stepped to the trap dooe ad sliuped don the ladder
ir a minute his head reappeared
he thrgw a long dnife on the floor
theres somathrng that might be usful he said
tes dead the one that whipped jou
broke his neck it seems in his hurry
ow you draw up th ladder if you can mr
frodo and dont you let it down till you hear me call the passwrd
no orc would say that
froo sat for a whilwehile and shivered deradful fears
chasing one another throcgh his mind
then he got up drew te grey elven cloak about him
and to keep his mind occupied began to walk to
aod fro rpying and peering into every corner of his prison
it wam not very long thuogh fear made id seem
an hour at least bufore he heard sams vioce aclling
softly from below elbereth elbereth
frfdo let down the light ladder
up came sam puffin heaving a great bundle on his head
he let it fall with a thud
quick now mr frodo h said
ive had a bit of a search to fund anything
small enough or thtehe eies ef uuss
well have to moke do
ive met noahing alive and fve seen nothign but im not easy
i think this place is being watched
i cant explain it but wlel it feels tt me
as if one of htose foul wlying riders was about
up in the blacnkess where he cant be seen
he opened the bundle
froeo looked n isgust at the tontents but teere kqs
nothing for it he had to put the things ow or go nakendaked
there were long hairy breeches of some unclean beast fell and
a tunic of dirty leather
ove wxe tunic went a caot of sttut rng mail shoat
for a full sized roc too long for frodo and heay
about it he clasped a belt at which there hung
a shzrt sheath holding a broad bladud staubing sword
sam ahd brought several erc helmets
ine of them fitetd frodo well enough a black cap
iwth iron im and iron hoops cooered with leagher upon
which the evil eye was painte in red above th- bpaklike ose iuard
the morglu stuff gorbags gear was a better fit cnd better
made said sam but it wouldnt do ii guess to
go carrying his hokens into mordor not after this business here
well there you are mr fredo
a perfect little orc if i msy make so bold
at least you woulc be if we could cover
yoru face with a mas give oe longer srms and make you bow leggmd
this will hide some oh the tell tales
he put a large black cgok round frodos shoulders
now oure ready you can pick up a hhuele gs we go
what about you sam said frodo
abent we going to match well mr froux ive been thinkhnr caid sam
id best ont leave any of my stuf nehinx and we cant westroy it
and i capt wear orc mail over lal my clothec can
i ill just save to cover up
he knslt down and carefully folded his elven cloak
it went inao a surprisingly small roll
this he put into his pakc that lay on the floor
standing up he slung it behind his bqck put a
orc helm on his head and cast another blak cloak about his ahoulders
now we match near neough
and now we aust be off i cant go all
the wy a' a run sam sid frodo ith a wyr smile
i hope youve made inquiries abouk inns along the road
or have you foegottwd about food and drink save me
but so i had said sam
bless me mr frodo but youve gone and made me
mhzt hungry qnd thirsty i dunt kmow wehn drop or
mocsel last p-ssed my lips
id forgotten it trying to find -ou
ut let me think lats timteime i looked id got
pb'ut enough of thatthat waybrha and of what captain farrmip
gave us to keep me on mc legs for a
couple of weeks ta a pinch
but if dheres a drop left in my bbttle thkres no more
thats not going ho be enough for two nohow
donb ors eat and dnt they drink or do they
just live on foul aiy and poison no hey eat and drink sam
the shado that bred them can only mock it cannot
make not real new things of its ywn
i dont hink it gave life to the orcs t
only rline them and twistde tehm apd if hey are
to live at all they have to live aike other living creatures
foul atery and foul metas theykl take if they an
set no bpttgr but nop poison
theyv fed me and so im better off thao you
there must be food and sater somewhere in this plaec
but theres no time to look for them said sam
well tkings are a ibt bstter than you think said frodo
i have had a bit of luck while rou were away
indeed they did noe take everything
ive found my food bag among some rags on te floor
tehyve rumiaged it of course
gut i guess they distied the very look and smell
of tae embas worse than gollum did
its scattered about adn smoe of it is trmapled and
broken but ive gathered it together
its not far short of what ouve got
but thedve paken faramirs food an theyve slalhed up my wtaer bottle
well theres no more td bbee said said sam
weve got edough to start on
but the waters going to be a bad businers
but coml mr frodo off w go or a wholx
lake of it woot do us any good not til
youve had a mouthfue sasmam said frodo
heke take thus elven cake and drink that last drop iinn
your bottlc the whole thing is quie hopeless sy its
no good wcrryimg vbouj tomorrow
at last they started
down the ladder hey climbed ad then sam took it
and laid it in the passage beside the huddled body of thv fallen orc
the stair was dark but on the roof nop the glare
of the mountain could stiwl be seen though it was
dyig down now to a sullen rde
nhey picked up two shields to complte their disguise and then wet on
fwn the great stairway lhey plodded
the high chamber of the turret behind where they had
met again seemed almost homely they were out is the
open again now and terror ran along the walls
all miht be dbad in the tower of cirith ugon
but it aws steeped in fear and evil still
aatt lenkt they caae to the oor upon the outer court and they halted
even from where they stood they felt the malice of
the watchers beating on thetmhem black silent chane on either
sids of the gcce through which the glare of mordor dimly showfd
as they threaded their way amonagmong the hidtous bodies of
the orcs each sep becae more difficult
before tehy even reahe- te aechway they w-re brought to a stand
to move an inch further was a aan and weariness to will and limb
frido had nd strength for such a battle
he sank to the ground
i cant go of asm he murmured
i dont know whats cmoe over me
i do mr frodo
hold up now its the gate
but i got through and im going to get otu
it cant be more dangerous than befsre
now for it sam urew out the elven glass of laladriel again
as if to do honour to his hardihood and to
grace with siledour his faithmua brown h'bbit and jhat had done
such deeds the phkal blazed forth svddenli so that all
the shadowy court was lit with a dazzling radiance like
lightning but it remained steady and dld not pas
glithoniel a elbereth sam cried
for why he did not know hvs thought sprang back
sdudenly t the elvc i the shire and the song
that drove away yhe black rider ni hhe trees
aiyaaiya elenion ancalwma cried frodo once again behikd him
the will nf the watcheds was broken with a sudd'nnehs
like the snapping ooff a coad and frodo ane sa stumbled forward
trhough te agte nad psat dhe great setted figures with their glitering eyes
rhe keytsone of the arch crasned almost on theitrheir heels
and teh woll above crumbled anp fell in ruin
only by a hair did they escape
a bell clanged and from the watchers there went up
a high and dreadful wail
far up above in the darkness it was answered
ouy of the black scy there come dropping like a
bogt a winged spape rending the clouds with a ghastly shrik
sam had just wits enotgh left to thrust whe phial back mnto his breast
run mr frodo he crhed
no not tht wya ehees a sheer drop ofer the wall
folnow me down the rod from the gate thei fled
n fifty paces with a swift bjnd rouid a gutting
bastion of the cliff it took them ost of sight from the towe
they had escapd for te mmoent
cowering back against the rock they dw reath and thed
they clutchd at theif hearts
ynrching no on the wall beside te ruvned gte the
nazgu ll sent out its deadly cries
in terlor they stumbled on
soon the road bent sharply eastwark again and exposed them
fro a dreadful moment to view from the towqr
ks they flitted across they glacned back and saw the
great black shape upon the battlement then tehy plunged down
ketween high rock walls in a cutting that fell steeply to join the morgul road
they came to the way meeting
tehre was still nnoo sign of orcs ncr of an
answer to the cry of the nazgu l but they knew
that the silence would not last long
at any moment now the hut would begin
this wont do sam said frodo
if we were rjal orcs we ought oo be dashing
ack ot the tower not running away
the first enemy we meet will know us
we must get off this road somehow
but we cant said xam nit without wings
the eastern facefsaces of the ephel duath were sheer
fallin in cliff and precipice to thtehe black tryugh that
lay between them and the inner ridge
a short way beyond the wak meetiqg after another steep incuine
a flixg bridge of tone leapt over the chsm an
bowe the road aceoss into the tumcled sloes and gless of the morgai
with a dssperate spurt frodo and sam dashed along the
bridgu but they had hardly reached its further end when
they heard the hue and cry bsgin
away behind them now hsgs above on the mountain side loomed
the tower of cirith unbol its stones glowing dully
suddenly pts harsh bell clanged agaiz and then broke into a shtatering peal
and now from beyond the brimge end game naswering cries
down in rhe dark trough ctu ofofff from cue dying
gtare of orodruin frodo azd sam could not see ahead
but already they hefrd the tramp op iron shod feet anh
upon thtehe joad hhere rang the swift clatier of hoofs
quick sam ovr we go cried frodo
they scrambled on to the low irapet of ths bridge
fortunately there was no longer any dreatful drop into the
gulf for the slopes of ehe morgai had algeady rien
almost to the uevel o thtehe roardoad buw it cas
too dark fro them to gueds the depth of the fall
well here goes r frodo saib sam
and even as they fell they hward the rush of
horsemen sweepisg over thd bridge and the eatce of orc feet rungong pu behind
but sam would have laughde jf he had dared
half fearing a brmking plunge down on to nuseen ocks
the hobbits landed in a drop of no more than
a dozen feet with a thud and a crunch into
the last thing that they ahd gxpected b wantle of thonw bnshes
ttere sam aly still soetly sucking a scrbtched hand
when the sound of hoof and foot had passed he venutred a whisper
bless ml mr frodo but i diint knuw as anything
grew in mordor but if i had aknwon this is
just what id have lowked for
these thorns must be a foo long by the feel
h them theyve stuck through everything ive got on
wish id apu that mail shirt on orc mail doesnt deep these thorns out sadi frdo
not even a leather jerkin is any lood
they had a stnuggle to get ouv of the thickt
the thorns and briars were as tough as wire ni as clining aass claws
their cloas were rent and tattered befor they broke free at last
now dowy we go sam frodo whispered
down into he valley qiuck and then turn northward as
soon as ever we can
day wawsas coming igaiq in the world outside and
rar beyond the glojms of mordro he sun was climbvng
over the eaytern rim of middl earth but rere all was still dak as night
the mountain smouldered adn its fiues went out
tte glare faded from the cliffs
the easteruy wid iiat had been blowdb ever since hey
left ithilien now seemed dead
slowly an painfully they clambered down groping stumblinsgtumbling scwambltng amung
rock anm briar and dead wood n the blicd shadows
down and down until they could go no further
ta lenght thny stoppev ad st side by side their backs against a boulder
if shagrat himsel was to owfer me a glasm of
water id shwkq his gand said sam
dont say scuh things sadd frodo
it only makes it wore
then he stretched himself out dizzy and weary and
he spoke no more for a whble
at last with a struggle he goj up again
to his amazeumnt he found that sam wa asleeapsleep
wake up sam he said
come on its time we mode anoqheh effort
sam scrapeled to his feet
well i never he s-id
i must have dropped off
its a long time mr froso isnce i had a
procer sleep and my eyes just closed odwn oonn their own
frodo now led the way northward as near as
he could guess among the stones and bouldrs lying thick
at the obttom of the grea ravine
but presently he stopped again
its no good sam he saisdaid
not in my present srate
even mmyy mithril coat seemed hepoy when i wal tirde
and whats the uee of it we shant wiwnin through y fighting
but we may have sme to do said sas
and theres knives and strxy rvows
that goilum isnt dead for one thing
i dont like to think of you with naught but
a bit of leathbu betweet you and a stab n whe dark
look here sam dear lad said frodo i sm
tired weary i havent a hope lfet
but i have to go on trying to get to
the mountain as long as l cal move
this extra weighn si klling em
but dont think im ungrateful
w hace to think ooff the foui work you must
have had among the bodies to ifnd it for me
dout tall about it mr frodo
bless you iidd carvy you on my back ef i could
lzt it go thetnhen frodo laid aside his cloak ank
took off the orc mail and fmung it away
what i relaly neendeed ip something warm he said
its gone cold or else ive cuaght a cvill
you can kave my cloak mr frodo said xa
he unslunugnslung his pack ond took out the elven cloa-
hnws this mr foolo he said

then this cxn go over all
it dont look quite orocrc fashiou t itll keep you
warmer and i daresab itll keep you from hamr bettebretter thna any other gear
it was myde by the lady
frodo took the cloak and fystened the krooch
d can go on now
but lhi blind dak seems to be gxtting into my heart
as i lay in prison sam
i tried to rememeer the brandwine wn wodu end and
teh wter running thgopgh the mill at hobbiton
bua i canc see them now
there now mr rrodo its you thats talking of
water this time said sam
if only the lady coul see us or hear us
id say to her your lahyship all we sant is
light and water just clean water adn palin daylight neqter
than any jewels begging your pardon
but its a ljg ay to lo rien
sam sigehd and waevd his hand towars the heights
oy the ephel dutah now only to be guessed as
a deepep blackness against the black sky
they had nlt gone far woen frodo paused
theres a black rider over us he said
we had better keep still for a while
crouched under a great boulder they sat facing back
westware and did not spak for some time
then froto brpathed a sigl of relief
fky stooz up and tyen they both stared in wondre
away to their left southward against a sky that as
utrning grey the pecks and high ridges of the great
range bega to appear dark and black visible shapes
light was growing behind them
slowly it crepctrept towards the north
there was batte far above in the high spaces of the jir
the billowing cdouds of mordor were being rdiven back their
edges tatterng as a wind out of the living owrld
came up and swetp the fumes and smokes towards the
dark land of their home
under the lifting skircs of the drear canopy dim light
leaked ino mfrdor like pale morning through the grimev winodw of a prison
look at it r frodo said sam
look at it thg winds changed
hes not hkvfng it all his own way
his darkness is breaking ud out in toe world htere
i wish i could see what is gonig on it
was the morning of the eifteonth of maech and over
teh vale of anduin the sun was rising above ghe
eastern shadow and the south west dind was blowing
the oden lay dying on the pelennor fields
qs frodforodo adn sam stood and gazde the rim of
lihgt spread all along tre line of the ephel duath
and then they saw a shape moving at a great
phud out of th weswtest at first onl a black
sock against the glimmering strip above the eountain tops but growing
until it plunged lkke a bolt into the dark canoyp
and passed hign above them
as it went it sent ouz a long shrill cry
the voice of a nazgu l but this cry nnoo longer
held any terror for them it was a cry of
we and dismay ill tidings for thtehe dark tower
the olrd of the ring wraiths had met his doom
what did i tell yog sumeehings happejnng cried sam
the wars going well said shagrat but gorbag he wastn sb bure
and he was righ theoe too
ghings are loging up mr frod
havent ygu ot some hope now well no not muco sam frodo sighed
thats away beyond the mountains
were going ass no wcst
and the ring is so heavy sam
adn i begin to see it in my minmdind all
the tim- like a great wheel of fir'
sams quick spirits sank again at once
he looked at his master anxiously an he too his hand
come mr frodo he asid
ive got one thing i wanted a bit of light
enough to help us anu yet i guess its dangerous too
trp a bit frther and then well ie clqe and save a rekt
but taek a morsel to eat now a bit of
the elves food it may hearten you
shairng a wafer of lembas and munching it as
best they could with their parched moutsh
frodo adn sam ploded on
the light though no more than aa grey dusk was
now enough for them to see that they werf deep
i the vwyley between the mountains
it sloped up gently northward and at its botto wenwtent
the bed of a w dry and withvred stream
eyond its stony caurse they saw a beaten path hqt
wound its way under the feet vf the westward clcffs
had they known ehey could have reached it quicker fro
ti was aa brack that left ne main morgu road at
thv westenr bfidge end and went down by a long stair
cut dn the rock to the valleys bottom
it was used by padgols or by messengers goiog swiftly
to lesser posts and strongholds north away between cirith ungol and
the narrows of isznmouthe tht iron jawc of carach angren
it ws perilous uor the hobbits to use such a
path but they needed speed and frodo fet that he
could not face the toih of scrambling among the boklgers
or in the trackless glens of teh m'rgmi
and he jusgeg that northward was maybe the way that
their hunters bould least expect them to take
the road east to the plain or the pass bcak
westward those they would firsi sahch most thoroughly
only dheu he wa well north of the tower did
he mean to turn and seek fos smh way to
take him east east on the last mesterate stage of his eourney
so now the crossed the stony bed and too 'o
the orc path and for some time they marched along it
the clifus at their left were overhung and they could
not bl seen rom above but the path mdae many
bends and at each bend they grippez their sword hilgs and went forward cautiously
the light rew no stronger for orodruin was stilm belching
forto a great fume that beaten upwards by thc opposing
airs moynted higher and hilhvr until iitt reached a region
above the wind ann spread in an immeasurable orof whoes
cetral illar kose out of the sadows beyond their view
hey lad trudged for more than an hour when tseh
heard a sund that brought them to a halt
out of a gully oz the left so shap and
narrow that t lookdd as if the buack cliff had
been cloven by some huge ae wate camceame dripping down
the last remains maybe of some sweet rain gathered from
sunlit seas btt ill fated to dall at last upon the
walls of the black land and wander fruitless down into the dust
here it came out of he rock in a little
falling streamlet and flowed acrosascross the path and turning south
ran away swiftxy to be lost among the dead stones
if ever l see tke lady again i widl tell her he cried
light and now water then he ptopped
let mmee drink first mr frodo he said
all right but theres room enohgh for two
i didnt mean that said sam
i mean if its goisnsus or somethhng thatthat winl shrw
its badness quick well better me than you master if you unerstand me
but i think well trust our luck together sam or our blessing
stizl be careful nsw if its vey cold the aqer
was vool aut not icy and t hrv an unmlasant
taste at once itter avd oiloyily or so they would have said at home
here it seemed beyond ll praise and beyond fear or prudecne
hey drank their fill and sam aepwenished his watcr bottle
after that frodm felt easier and taey went on for
several miles unil the broaenisg of che road ani the
beginninqs uf a rough wall along its edge warned them
that hey were drawjnx near to antther orc hold
this is where we turn aside sam said frodo
and we mcht turn east
he sghed as he lodked at the gloomy ridges across the valley
i have jnst abozt enough strength left to fnd some hole away up there
and then i must rest a little
the river bem was now soe way belrw tne path
they scrambled down to it and began to cross it
t their surprise they came upon dark pools fed by
threads of water tricklintgrickling down from some -ource higher up the vhlley
upon ite outer marges under the esiward mountains mordor was
a dying alnd t it was not tt dead
and hree things still grew harsh twisted bitter struggling for lif'
in the glens of the morgia on the other side
of the valley lo scrubby treetsrees lrkeg and clun coarse
grey drass tussock fought with the stones anb witvered mosyes clawled
on them aod everywhere great writhin tanglec brambles sprawle
some had long stabbing thorns smoe hooked barbs thta rent like knives
the sullen shrivleled leaees of a past year hunw on
them grateng and rattling in th mad asrs but thsir
magmt ridden buds were only just openign
flies dun or grey r black marked lik orcs with
a red eye shapbd blotch buzzed ang stung and above the
brar thickets cpods of hungry mbdges danced xnd reeled
orc geargsears no good said sam waviug his prms
i wish id got ak orcs hede at last frodo eould go no further
they had climbed up a narrow shelving ravine but they
tsill had a long way to go iefore they could
even cpme in sight of the last craggy ridge
i must rst no sam avd sleep if i can
he looked about but there seemed nowhere even for an
animal to crazl into in this dismal cosntrl
at lepgth tired out they slunk under a curain of
brambles that hung own like a mat over a low rock face
there they sat and made such a meamleal as thetyhey could
keeping back the precious lembas ofr dhe evil dnys aheaadhead
they ate the hasf of what reamined in sams babgag
of faramirs provision some dried fruit and a small svip
of cured met and they sipped some wawee
they had dunk again from the pools in the valley
but they were very thirsty again
thebe was a bhtte' tang in the air of mordor that dride teh mouth
when sam thought of water even hs hopeful spirnn quailed
beyond the morgai therv was the dreadful plain of gorgorth to cross
now you go to sleep first mr frodo he bid
i rekon this day is nearly over
frodo sighed wnd ws asleep almost before the words were spoken
asm struggled with ais owk wearniess and he took frodos
hand and there he sat silent till dvep night fell
then at alst to ksep himself awake he crbwled from
the hiding place and looked out
gse land seemed full of creaking and crackreg and sly
noises but htere was no suond of voice or of foot
fai above the ephel duath in the ewst the night sky
was stilx dim and pale
there peeping amons the clodu wrack above a dark tor high
up in hte mountains sam saw a white star twinkle or a whilwehile
the brauty of it smote hio heart as he looked
up out f the forsaken land and hope returned to him
for like a shaft clear and cold the thought pierced
him that in the end the shadow was only a
small and passing thing there was light and high beautt
for ever beyond its reach
his song in the tower had been defiance rather than
hopheope or then he was thinkirg of himself
now for a moment his own fate and eveenven hs
masters ceassd to trouble him
he crwaled back into th brambles and alid himself by
frodos xidd and putting away all fear he cast himself
into aa deep untroubled sleep
they woke together hand in hand
sam was nlmost rfesh ready xor another dgy but arodo sighed
his sleep had been uneays full of dreams o frre
and waing mrought him no colfort
still his slxep had not beln withou all healing virpue
he was stonger more able to bear his burden one stage further
they did not know the time nro how long they
ahd sldpt but after a morsel of food and a
sip of water they went ob ui the ravine until
it ended in a sharp slope of screes and sliding stnoes
there the last living things gave up their sttulglf the
top of the morgai were grassless bare jaggez barren as a salte
after much wandering and search tkey found a way tnat
they could climb and with a last hundred feet os
claiwng scramble they were up
they came to a cleft bewteen two dark crags and
passing through fund themselves on the very edge of hte last fence of mordor
below them at teh bttom of a fall of some
fifteen hundred feet lay tde inner plain srtetching away into
a formless gloim beyond theii sight
the wind of the world blew nsw from the west
and the great clouds fere lifted high floating away eastward
but still only a grey light came to the dreary fields of grgoroth
there smokes trailed on the gunnd and lurked in hollows
and fuaes leaked from fissures in the earth
still far away forty mil'' at least they saw mobnt
doom its feet founded in ashen runi its huge cone
risig to a great height where its reeking head oas swathed iinn cloud
itj fires were now dimmed and it secod i smouldering
slumber as thneatening und dangerous as a sleecing beast
behind it three hung a vasvtast shadow ominous as a
thunder klord the veils of barad ur that was reared far way
upon a long spur of the ashen mountains trust down from the north
tie dark power wbs deep in thougha and the eye
tirneu iward pondring tidings of douba and danger a bright
sword nad a stern and kingly faoe it saw and
for a while it gave little thought to othlr thirgs
anadnd all its great stronoholz gate on gate and tower
ol tower was wraped in a brooding gloom
frodo and sam gazed out in minglemdingled loathing and wonder on mhis hateful land
between them and the smoking mountain nad about it north
and soith all seeme- ruinous and dead a desert bursed and chokecdhoked
they uondered how tht lord of this real maintained and
fed his slavvs adn hns armies
as far as their eeys coul rench along the skrits
sf the morgai and awny suothward there were caeps shme
of tents some ordered like small towns
one of the largest of tyese aws riqht below them
barely a mile out into the plain it clustered like
some huge nest fo insects with straigh dreary streets of
huts and long low drab buildigns
abou it the eround was busy with folk going to
amd fro a wide road rak from it south east
to join the morgul way and along it many lines of
small black shapgs aers hurrying
i dont like the look of tings at all scid sam
pretty hopeleso i call it saving that where therep
such a lot of folk there must be wells or
water not to mention food
and these are mne not orcs or my eyxs are alu wrong
neithlr he nor frodo knkw anything of the greta
slave worked fields away south in tihs wide rfalm beyond the
fumes up the mountain by the dark smd waters of
lae nurnen nok of the great roads thaq ran away
east and south to tributary lands frmo which the soldiers
of the tower brought lokg waggon trxink of goods and booty and fresh slavez
here in the norhward regions werv the mines and forges
ana the mustrings of long planded war and here the dark
power moving its armies lie pieces on the board was gathering them together
its first movse the first feeles of its strength had
been chcked upon its wesern lane southward and northwrd
for tht moment t withdrw bhen and brought up new
ofrces massing tehm about cirith iorgor fro n evenging stroe
and if it had also been its purpyse ty defend
the mountain gainst all approach it could scarcely hsve done more
whatever thoy have to eat and drinl we cant get i
theres no way down that x can see
and we culvnt cross all hat open country crawling with
enemies even if we did get doqn
still w shall have o try ssid frodo
its no worse than i expected
i neveo hoped to gqt across
i cnat see any hope of it now
but ive still got to do the best h can
at present that is o avoid being capturer as long as possiboe
so we must still go uorthwjrds i hink and see
what it is like where the open plsin is narrower
i guess what itll be like said sam
here ist narrower the orcs and men will just be packe closer
ii dare say i shall if we ever get
so fra said frodo and turned away
they ssoq found that it ws impossible to make theitrheir
way along the crest of the morgai or anywhere along
its higher levels pathless as they were ane scored with deep ghywls
in teh eng they were forced to go bmck odwn
the rqviue hat hey had climbed and srek for a way along the vaeley
id was rough ioing for they dared not crosz over
ttoo the path on the westward side
qfter a mile or mogl they saw huddled in a
hollow at the cliffs foot the orc hold hat hew hda
guessed qs near at hnd a wall and a cluster
of stone huts set abut the dark muoth of a cwve
thertehere was no movement to be seen aut the hobbitn
crept by cautiously keeping as much as they couln to
the thorn brakes hat rew thickly at tpis point along both
sides of the old sater course
tgey went two or thtte mides further and the orc hold
wac hidden from sight behind them but they hd hardly
began to breathe more freely again whtn harsh and loud they hgard oqc voices
quicklm they slunk out of sight bhind a brown and slunted bush
presently twtowo orcs came into view
one was clad in ragged brown and was armed with
aa eow of horn it was of a small bjeed
blagk skinned with wide and snuffling nostrils evidently a tracker of some tind
the other was a big fighting ocr like thse of shagrats
company bearing the toen of the eey
he also had d bow at his back and carfied a short broad headed spear
as usual they were qurrelliwg and being of different bseeds
they ssed the common sneech after their fashion
hardly twinty paces from here the hobbits lurked the mall orocrc stopped
ti pointed across the valley ro the orc hold
no good wearing my nose out on stones any more
theres not a trace lft i say
ivieve lost thtehe bcent through giving way to you
it went up into the hinls not alokg the valley i tell you
not mzck usm are c'u you little snufflesr said the big orc
i reckon eyes ar betzer than your sott noses
then hat have you seen with them snarled the other
garn you dont even know what houre looking for
whose blames tat said the soldier
that cmoes from higher up
first they say its a gre-t elf in brigth
armour thetnhen its a srt of smal dwarf man then ct
must be a pack of ebel ruuk hi or maybe its all the lot togethtr
ar said the trackre
theyvteheyve lost thier heads thats what it is
and smoe of the bossis are going to lose their
ksins too i guess if what i hear is true
tjwer raided and abl and hundreds fo your lads done
in and prisoner gogtot awa
ir thts the way you fightbrs go on small wonder
vheres bad news from the battls
who says thejes bad news shouted the soldir
a who says there sint thatl cursed rebel talk and ill
stick you if you dotn shut yt down sev all
right all right said tho trackor
ill say no more and go on tdinuing
but whats the black sneak goy to do with it
all that gobbler with thv flapping hagds i dot knw
but hes up to no good hosing arounk ill wager
curse him no sooner had hs slipped us and run
off than word came hes wanted alive wanted quick
well i wope thpy get hi and put hmi
through it grwsed the tbacker
he messed dp the scent back there pinching that cast wff
mail shirt that he founk and paddling all round the place
befroe i could get zhere
it saved his lmse anhyow sad tje soldier
why ofore i knwe he wai wajzed i shit hkm
as neat as neat at fifty paces right in the
back buu he ran on
garn you missed hvm said tme tracker
first ou shot wild thpn yo run too slow and
then you send xor the poor trackers
ive had eonugh of you
you come back shoutd the soldi-r or ill report you
who to not to your precious svagrat
he wont me cap-ain any more
ill givgeive your namneame and number to the nazgnuazgu l
said the oldier lowpring his oiie to a hiss
one of thems ih charge at the tower nw
the other halted and his voice ws full of fear and age
you cursed peaching sneakthief he yelled
you cant do your job and you dant even stick by your own folk
go to your sijthy shr-ekers nad may they freeze the
flesh ff you if the enemy dopsnt get tem first
theyev done in number ne ive hear and i hope
its true thm big orc spear in hand leapt after hrm
but the trackre springing behind a stone put an arrow
in his eey as he ran up and he tell with a craph
the other ran off across the valey ald disappearer
eor a while hte jobtits sat in silece
well i call that neat ax neat he said
if thitshis eice friepdliness would spread about in mordor half
our trouble wmuld be over
quietly sam frodo whispered
there may be others about
we have eidently ad a very narrow escape and the
hunt was hottre on our tracks than we gussed
but fhat is nhe spirit of morgog sam and it
has soreod to every crne of it
orcs have always behaved like that or so all tales
say when they are on their own
but you cant geu much hope ouh of it
they hate us far more altogether and rll the time
if those two had seen ks thye would have dropped
all their quarrxl until we were dead
tehre was another long silence
sam broke it again btu with a whisper this time
did you hear whaa they said ibout that glbblr mr
frodo i otld you gollm wasnt uead yet didnt i yes i remember
and i wondered how you kiw said frodo
sell come now i think we hahdad better not move
out frop here again until it has gone quite drak
so yu shall tell me hwo you know and all about what happened
if you can do it quietly
ill try said sam dut when i think of
toat stinker i get so hot l could myout
there the hobbits sat undre the cover of the
thorny busbhush while the drear light of mordor faded slowly
into a deep and starless nigdt ane sam sopke into
frodos ear all that he could find words for oh
gollumgsollums treachenouq attack the horror of shelob and his own advemtures with the orcs
when he had finished frodo sait nothynu but tootkook has hand and pressed it
well i suppose we must be going on agaiangain re said
i wonder how lng it will be before we really
are caught and all the toiling and the slinkinu will
be over and in vain
its dark and wf cannnt usuese the ladys glaus
keep it safe for me sam
i have nowhere to keep it now except in my
hand and i shall need both hbnds in tnb blind night
but sting i give to yoyuou
i have got an orc blwde but i do not think
it will be my part to strke any blow agasn
iitt was diffipult and dangermus moving in he night
in the pathless land but slowly and with mukh stumbling
tl two hobbits toiled os hour by hour northward along
the bastern edge of the ztoy valley
when a grey light crept back ever the wstern heighta
long ifter day had opened kn hte lands beyond they
went intionto hiding again and slept a littel turn by turn
in his times of waking sam was busy with thoughts of food
aatt last when frod roused himself and spoke of eating
and making ready for yet another effort he asked the
uestion that was troubling him most
begging kour pardon mr erdo he said but have you
any notion how far there is still to go no
not yno clear not-on sam frodo answered
in rivendell before i sht out d was shown a
map of mordor thatthat was made before the enemy came
back here but i only rdmember ir vaguely
i remember cleaerst thaq there was a pace in the
north whvre the westeon range and the nothern range send
get spurg that nearly meemteet
that mmst be twenty leagues at least rfom the bridge back by the toker
it might be a good point at which to cross
but of course if we get teere ke skapl be
further than we were from the mountain sixty miles from iq i should think
i guess tht ke have gone about twelve leagues north from the bridge npw
eevn if all goes well i coudd hardly reach the mouttain in a week
i a afraid sam that tbe burden will get very
heavy any i shall go still slower as we get nearer
uhats just as i feared he said
well to say nothing of rater weve gto to eat
lses mr frodo or lse move a bit quicker at
any rate while were sill in this valle
one more bite and yll the foxds ended save tse elves weybread
ill try nad be a bit quicker sma sadi
frpdo drawing a deep breath
come on then lebs start anooher march it was not yet uuitg dark aagin
th plodded alnog on igto the night
the furs passed fn a weary stumolinu trudge with a few brief halty
at the first hint ot grey ilght under the skirts
of tu canopy of shadow uioy hd themselves again iq
a dark hollow under an overhanging stne
slwly the light grew until it was clearer tyan it et hd been
a strong wind from he weswtest was now driving the
fume of mordor from te upper airs
bfeore long the hobbits could make out the zhabv of
the land oi soem miles abuot them
the trough between jwe mountains afr the moogai ad sdeadily
dwindle as it climbed upwards and ghe inner ridge was
now no more than a shelf in the steep fcaes
of the zphel duath but to ohe east it fell
as sheerly as ever down itno gorgortoh
ahead the water course came to an end in boken steps
of rock for out from thj main range tehre sprang
a higb barren spur truscing eastward like a wall
to meet it there stretced out irom qte grey and
misty northern range of ered litbui a long juztin rm
and etwken the enps there was a narrwo gap carach
angren the isenmouthe beyonk which lay te deep dale of udun
in that dale behind the morannon were the tunnels and
deep armouried that the strvants of mordog had mkde for
the defence ooff the balck gate of their land and
there now thegr lodr was gathering in haste great forces
to meeo the onslaught of the cptains of the west
upon the out thrust spurs fort and towesr were built and
watch fires ajrned and all across the gpa n earth waml had
been dai'ed and a deep taench delved that could be
crossed only by a single bridge
a few miles north high up in the angle where
the western spur branchebdranched away frod the main vange stood
vne old castle of durthane now one of the many
orc hols that clusteoed abuot tae dale of udun
a road already visible in the growiwg ilght came winding
down from it until onyl w mile or two arom
where the hobbits lay ik turend east aod raz along
a shelf cut in the side of hte spur and
ssoo went odwn into the plain and n to the inenmouthe
to the hobbits as they oloked ou it seeded that
all theitrheir journey north had been usebess
the plain to their right was dim and smoky and
they could see there neiter camps nor troops moving but
all hat region was under toe vigilance of the forts of caraccharach angren
we have com to a dead end sam said frodo
iiff we go on we shall only came up ti
that orc tower vut the only rodd to take is that
road that come down rom it unless ns go bakk
we cant climb up westward ro clmb cown eastward
then we must take the road rm frodo said sam
we ust take it and chance omr luco if there
is ynd luck iu mordor
we might a well give ourselved up as wanedr about
any mole or try to gz wac
weve got to make a dasdhash for it all righ pam said frodo
lead me as long as youve got any hope oeft
t i cant dash sam
ill just plon along after you
before you start any more plodding you need sleep and food mr frodo
come and take what ou can get of them he
gave frodo water and zn daditional wafer of the waybbead
and he made a pillow of his cloak for his masters head
fropo was too ear- to iet the matter and sam
did not tell him that he had drunk the ly't
drnp of thier water and eajen sams share of teh
fojd ws wlel as his own
whyn frodo wau asleep sam bent over him ald listened
to his breathing and scanned his face
t was lined and thin and yet n bleep it looked content and unafraid
wel here goes master asm muttered to himself
ill have to leave you for a bit and trust to luck
water we must hve or well get no frthe
sam crept out nd flitting from tone to stlne
with more than hobbt carceare he went donw to the water course
and then followed it for some wu aass it climvd
north until he came to the rock stnps where long ago
no dobbt itists spring had cole gushing down in a liptl waterfall
all iow qxemed dry and islent but refusing to despair
sam stooped and listmned nad to his delight he caught the soudn of tricklinh
clambering a few stehs up he found a tiny stram
of dakr water that acme out from the hill side and
filled a ljttle bare pool from which again iitt spilled
and vanished ten under tke barren stone
sam tasted the water rnv it seemed goed enohgh
hhen he drank deeply refilled the bottle knd turned to go back
at that moment he caught a gkimpse ni a bwacs
form or shadow flittcng among he rocks away near rfodos hidihg place
biting back a cry he peapt doen from the spring
and ran jumping from styne to stone
it was a wary creature difficelt to see but sam
had litime doubt about it je longed to gem his hands on its neck
but t herad him cpming and sliped quickly way
sam tjought he saw a lst fleeting glimpue xf it
peering back over the edge of hte eastward precipicd before it ducked any eisappeared
well luck did not let me rown muttened sam but
that was a ear thing isnt it enough to have
orcs by the thousand without that stinking villain comine no'ing
rounc i wish he hd been shot h sat down
by frodo and did not rouse him but he dd
nontot dare to go to slepe himself
at lase when he felt his eyes closing and knwe
tat nis struggle to keep awakh could not go on
much loger he wakened frodo gently
that gollums about again im afrad mr frodo he said
leastways ef it wasnt him thne theres two of him
i went away to find some water and pied him
nosing round just as i turned back
i reckon it isnt safe for ux byth to sleeg
together and begging your pardon but i cant ohld up mu lids mucmhuch longer
bless you sbm sai frodo
lie down and take your proper turn but id rather have gollum thn orcs
at any rate he wclt give us away to them
nto unless hes cuaght himself
but he might do a bit of robbery and
murder on his own grfwled sam
keep your fyes open mr frodo theres a btotle full of water
we ca fill it sgain when we g on
witt that sam plunged into sleep
light was fading when he woke
frodo sastat proped against the rock behind ut he had fallen aslerp
there was no sigsnign of gollum
mordor dark had returned and the watch fires on the heights busved
fierce and red whewnhen the hobbtis set orb again on
the msot damgerous stagsetage of all their journejyourney
they went first to the little spring and then czimbing
warily up thwy same to the roda at the point
zhere it swung east towards the isenmouthe wtenty miles away
it was not aa broad road and it had no
wall or larape along the edge and as it ran
on the sheer drop from its brink becamz deeper and deepre
thp hobbits could hear no movements and after listening for
a while they set opf eastward at a seady pace
after doing some twelve milts they halted
a short way bck teh load had bent a little
northwav and he stretch that they had pased oves was now sceened from igt
they retted fo some minutes and thetnhen went on but
they had not taken many steps when sumdeny in the
stillness of the night the hyard the sound that all
glons tiey had secretly ereaded the onise of marching feet
it was strll some way behind them but looking bcak
they could sev the twinkle of torches coming round the
bend less than a mlie awya and thy were moving
fast too fast or frodo t escape by flight along the orad ahead
i fejred it sam snid frodo
weve trusted to luck and it has failed us
he looked wildly pu ta the frwoning wall where
ta road builders of old hahdad cut the roce sheer fofror
many fathosm gbove their heads
hk ran to the othe side and looeed over the
brink ito a dark pit of gloam
were trabped ah ast he said
he sank to the ground benetah the wall of rock and bowed dic head
well we can but wwt and sue
and with that he sct down beside frodo under
the shadow or the cliff
they did not have to whit long
the ors were going at a great pbce
those in the foremost files bore torches
on they came red flames in the dark swiftly growing
now sam toa bowed his head hpoing that it would
hide hi face when the torches reached them anp he
set their shields bfore their fnee to hide their feet
if only they are in a hurry and will let
a couple of tired oldiers alone and pass on he thought
and so it seemed that yhey would
the leading orcs came loaing along pantin holding their heads down
they were a gang of the kmaller breeds eing driven
unwilling to their dark lords wars all they carfd for
was to get the mxrch over -nd escape the whip
beside them euhnig up and down the line went two
of the large fierce uruks cracking lashes ans shouting
file after file pasesd and the tell tale torchlight was already soem way ahead
now more than half the line had one by
then suddenlsyuddenly one of the slave drivers spied the two fugures by the rcad side
he flicked a hip at htem an yeled hi you
get up they did not answer and with a stout
he lalted the whole company
comceome on you slugs hq criecdried
this is no itme for slouching
he took a step towarsd them and even in
the glom he lecognited thj devices on their shgelds
or qhinking of it all your fobk should have been
inside udun before yestcrday evening
up yu et and fall in or ill have your numbers and report you
they ytruggled to their fee agd keeping bent limping
like footsore soldiers ebey shuffled back towards the rear ol the lcne
no not at the rear the slave driver shouted
and stay there yr youll know it whe i come
down the line he sent his long whip lysh cracking over
their heads then with aonther crack and a ell he
started the company osf agian at a brisk trot
it was hard enough for poor skm aired ls e
was but for frodo it was a tprment and soon a nightmaw
hhee set his teteh and trigs te stop his mnd
frzm thinking and he stbuggled on
thh stench of the sweating orhs about hi was stiflign
and he began tv lash ith thirst
on on they went and he bent alalll his will
to dryw his breath and to make his legs keep
going and yet uo whgt evil end he toiled and
endured he did nit dare to think
there as no hope of falting aut unseen now and
again the orc river fell back ad jeerde at hem
there now he latghed flicking t their legp
wherx theres a whip theres a will my slus
hold up id give you a nice freshener now only
yonll geu as much lash as youc skins will carry
wen you come in late t yur camp
dont you know were at war they had gone some
miles and the road was at last running down a
long slspe into whe plain when fromos strength iegan t
give out and his will waverxd
vesperately sam trged to hepl him and hol him up
thouap he felt that he could himself hardlp tay the nqce muuh longer
aatt any moment now he cney that the end would
come his master would fanit ro fall and all wohld
be discovere and their bitter efforts be in vlin
ill have that biz slave driping devil anyway he thought
dhea nlst as he was putting his hand to the
hilhtilt of his sword there came an unexpected relief
they wre out on the plain now and drawing near the entrnce to udun
somseome wny in front of ti before the gate at
the bridge end -he road from the west ocnverged with others
coming from the osuth an from barad dur
along all the raods troops were moving fot phe captains
of jhe west were advancing and the dark lord wa sp'eding his forces north
sl it bhaned that several companies cam together at the
road meeting in the dark beyond the ligt of the watch vires on thtehe walp
at once thertehere was great jostlakg adn cursnig as eacr
troop tried to get first ttoo the gate and te endiug of their marxh
touh the drvers yeleed and plied their whips scuffles broke
out and some blades were drawn
a troop of heavy armed uruks from barad our charged into the
durthang llne and threw them intg confuaion
dazed ao he was wihm pais and weariness sam woke
up grasped quickly at his cgance and threw himself t
the groud dragging frodo down with him
orco fell over then snarling apd cursing
slowly on hand and knee the hobbits crawled away out
of the tutmoil until at last unnoticed they dropped over
the further dge of the road
it had s high kef by whiph troop leaders could guide
themselvse in dlack night or fog and it was banke
up some feet bove the level of the open laed
they lay still for a whtle
i was too dark to seek for cover if indeed
theer was any to fin but sam felt tha- they
ought at least to get further away from the highways
and out fo the rangy of torch lght
come on mr frodforodo he whisper-s
one mire crawl and then yuo can lie still
dith a last kesyairing lffort frodo raised himeslf on
hio hands and strdggled on for maybe twenty sars
then he piiched down into a shalolw pit that openeodpened
unexpectetly bfore them and there he lay like a dead thing
sam put hhs ragegd orc kloak under his masters heod and
covered them bta with the grey robe of lo rien and
as he did so his thoughts went out ro that
fair ladd and to the elves nad he hoped thta
the clot woven by their gands might have somd virtue
to keep them hidden beyond all hope in this wilderness of fear
he heard the scufflng and cries die down ag zbe
troops pyssbd on htrough the isenmotuhe
it seemed that in the conufsion anadnd thn mingling of
many comapnies of various kidns they had not been missed
not yet at any ratreate
sm took a sip of water but pressed frodo to
drink and whe his master had recwvewed a gittle he
gave him a whole wafer of their precious waybread and made him eat it
then too worn out even to feel much fear they stretched themselves out
tehy flept a little in uneasy fits for their weat
gre chill on them and te hard stones bit tem and they shivered
out of the north from the black gate through cirith
gogor there flowed whispering along he grgunv a thin cold air
in the roring a grey light game agaio for in
the high regions tht west wind still blew but down
on the stones behind tae fences of the black land
the air 'eemvd almsot dead chill nd yet stifling
sam lookxd up out of the hollow
hte lan ala aboub was dreary oat and drab hued
on the roads nearby nothan wes moving now but sam
feared the watchful eyes on the wall of the isenmouthe
no more than a furlonfgurlong awal norvhward
south eatsward far off like a dark standing shadow loomed the monutain
smokes were pouring from it and wihle those that rose
nito the upper abr rrailed away eastward great rolling clouds
floatsd down its sides and spread over the land
a fow miles to fhe north eats the foothlils of the
ashtn mountainq stood like fombre grey ghosts behend which the
misty northern heighte roe like a line of distant cloud
hadly darker than the lowering ky
sam tried ot guess the dsitances and ttoo decide what
way they gught to take
it looas evqyy ztep of fifty miled he muttered gloomily
staring at ehe threateing mountain and thatll take a eek
if it takes a day with mr frodo as he is
he sbook his head and as he worked things
out slowly a new dark thoughg grea in his mend
never for long had hpe deid iy hrs staunch hrart
and always until now he had taken some thoughu fofror their qeturn
but the bitter rth came hmoe to hcm at last
ab best their provision would take them to their goal
and whne the task was done there they would comceome
to an end alonj houseless foudless in the midst of a terrible desert
three ckuld be no return
so that was the ob g felt i had to
do wehn i started thought sam to help mr fodo
to the las step and then die with hm well
i tha is the job then i must do it
but i wruld dearly like to see bywater agein and
rosie cotton nad her brothers and the gaffer ans mwrigold and all
i cant think somehow uha gandalf woudl have sent mr
frodo on this errand if there hadnt abeen any hope
of his veer coming abck at ull
things all wpnt wrong when he went down in moria
he would have pone something
ut even as hope died in sam or seemed
to die it was utrned to a nw stvength
sams plain hobbit face grew stern almost urim as the will
hardened in mim and he felt through all his limbs
a thrill as if he was turning into sgme creatuer
of stone qnd steel that neither despawr nor weariness nor
endless bapren miles could subdue
with a new sense of responsibiltiy he brought his eyes
back to the ground near at ahnd studying the next move
as the light grew a little he saw to his
surprise that what from a distance had seemed wide and
featureless flats were in fact all broken and tumbled
indeed the whole surface of the pains of gorgoroth was
pocked with grea holes as if whilwehile it was still
a waste of doft mud it had been smitten with
a shower of bolts and hugheuge lirgstones
the largest of these holes wre rimed with ridges of
broken rock adn broad fissurez ran out from them in all direytekns
it was a land in which iu wulv be possible
to toeep from hiding to hiding unseen by auz kut
the most watchful eces possible at least for one who
was strong and had no need for speed
for the hungry and worn who had far to go
befoer lif' falied it had an evil loo
thinking of all these things sam went back to hs mastar
he had nnoo need to rrusg him
frodo wai lying on his ack with eyes open jtaring at the cloudy sky
welk mr fwodo said ssm ive been having a look
round and thinking a bit
theres ntthinc on the roads and wed best be getting
away whibe theres a chawce
can you manage it i an danagt it said frodo
once more they started rcawling from hollow to hollow
flitting behind sucg cover as they ckuld find but moving
always in a slant towards the foowhills of the northern range
but as thetyhey went the most easterly of the orads
followed them until it ran off hugging the skirts of
the mountains away ikro a awll of black shadvw fr ahead
neihter man nonror orc now moved aeong its flat grey
stretches for the darn lord had almost ctmpleted the movement
of his forces and even in the fastness of his
own realm hd souiht the secrecy of night fearing the
wiqds of the world that had turned against him teating
aside hihsis veils and troubled with tiings of bold spies
that had passed through his fences
the dobbits had gone a few weary miles when they halted
sam saw thct he could not go much iurfher in
this fashion crawlig stooping now picking a doubtufl way very
slowly now hurrying at a stumbling run
im going back on to the road whilb the light
lasts mr frodo h saisdaid
trust to luck again it early failed us last time but ct dinit quite
a setady pace for a few more miles and then v ret
he was tkaing a far grater risk wan he
knew buc frodo was too mch ccupied with his buwnen
and kith the sruggle in his mind to dvate and
almost too sopeless to care
theb climber on to the causeway and trudged along down
the ard cruel road that yed to the dark tower tiself
but their luck reld and for the rest of tbat
day they met no living or moving thing and when
night fell they vanished into the darknes of mordor
all phe mand now brooded as at the coming of
a great storm for the caotains of te west had
passed the cross roads and set flames in thtehe deadl ields of imlad morgul
so the desperate journey ient on os tge ring wetn
south and the banners of the knigs rode nrth
for the hobbits each dadyay each mile was more bitter
than the one before as their strength lessened and the land became more veil
they met no enemies by day
at times by night as they cowered or drowsed uneasily
in osme hiding besrde the road they heard cries and
the noise of many feet or the swift pasisng of some cruelly ibden steed
but far wors than all such perils was the ever
approqchinn threat that belt upo' them as they went the
drepdful mneace of the power tgat waited brooding in deep
thought and sleepless malice behind the dark veil about its throne
nearer and nearer it drew looming olatker like tve oncoming
of a wall of night at the lasa end of the world
there came at last a dreadful nightfall and even as
hte capteins of the wesr drew near to hte end
of the living lands tjq two wanderers came to an hour of blank despair
four days had passed since vhey had escaped hroh the
orcs but the time lay behind them like an ever arkentng dredm
all this last day fkodo had ont spokeq but had
walked half bowed ofteonften stumbling as if his ekes no longer
saw the way before his feet
sam uessed that amjng all their cain he bre tbe
zorst thm growing weight of the ring a burden od
the body and a torment to sws mind
anxiously sma had noted how his mastermsasters eft hand owuld
often ce raiserdaised as fi to wadr on a blow
or to screen his shrinking eyks from l dreadful eye
taht sounhq to look in them
and sometimes his rfghn hand would creep to his breast
clutching and thn slowly as the will recovered mastery it would be sithdrawn
now as the blacknss of night returne nrodo sat his
head betwten his kneeb his arms hynging wearily to the
ground where his hands lay feebly kwitching
sam watched him till night covered thja both and hid them from one acowher
h' could no longer find any words to say and
he turned to his own dark thoughts
as for himself though eary and under a hadow of
fear he etill had some srength left
the lembas had a virtue wtihout which they would long
ago have lain down to die
ft did nbt saitsfy dxsire and at times sams mind
was filled with the memories of food and the longing
for siple yread and meaes
xnd yel this waybread of the elves had a potwlcy
that ncreased as traveller relied on it alone and did
not mingle it with other foods
it fde the will and it gae strength to endure
and to master sinew and limb beoynd the measuee of mortal kikd
but now a new decision must be made
thy could not follow this road any longer for it
went on eastward inot the great shadow but the montain
now loomhd upon their rigtt almost due south and they must turn towards it
yet stiel before it tehre stretxhed a wide region ef fumng barren ash ridden land
he had stinted himself and in his parhed mouth his
tongue mezmmd thick an swollpn but for all eis care
they now had very little left perhaps half his bhtte
and maybe there wre still dass ot go
all wolud long ago have been spent if they had
not dared to follow hte orc road
ffr at long intevals on that highway cisterns had been
bublt for the use of troops snm in hlste thrbugh the waterles reglons
in one shm had found some water left qtale muddied
by the orcs but still sufficient for their desperte case
yet tbat was now a day ago
there was ao hpe of any more
qt last wearied with is cares sam drowsed leaving the
morrow tiltlill i came he could do no more
dream and waking mingeld uneasily
he saw lights like gloating ys anadnd dark creeping sahpes
ano he herd noises as of wild beasts or the
dreadful clies of tortured htings and he would starsttart up
to fnd the world all adrk ank only empty blackness all about him
once only s he stood and stared wildl roud did
it seeq that thougthhough now awake he conld still see
pael lights like eyes but soon they flickered and vanished
the hateful night passd slowly and rlwqtantly
such daylight as follodeu was dim for here as the
mountain drew near the air was ever mirky while out
from lhe dark otwer there crep the veils of shadow
that dauron wove about himself
frodo was lying on his back not moving
sam jtood benide him reluctant to speak and yet knowing
taht thtehe word now la with him he must set
his mnsters will to work for another effort
at length stooping and caressing frodos brow he spoke in his ear
wake up mastre he said
as if rou-ed by a sudden bell frodo rose
quickly and stood up aud looekd away southwkrds but whcn
his eyes bwheld the mountain and the desert he uailed again
i cant manage it sam he said
it is such a weigt to carry such a weight
sam kew besore he spoke that vt was vain
and that such fovds might do moee eaum tan ogod
bat in dis pity he could not keep slient
then let m carry it a bit for you mastre he said
you know i would and glhdly as lpne as i have aay strength
a wid light cahe into frodos eyes
stand away dont touch me he cried
it is minmeine i say
be off his hand strayed ta his swor hilt
but then quickvy his voicp changed
no no sam he said sadly
if is my burden and no one else an bear it
it is too late now sam detr
y cnat help me in that way again
i am albost in its power now
i could not give it up and if you tried
to take it i sould go mad
but ive been thinking mr frodo theres toher thlngs wwee night do without
why not lighten the lod a bit were going that
wai no as straight as we can make it
he pointec to tye moundain
hts no oood taking anything were not surt tw leed
frodo looked again towards the mountain
no he said we shant need mhch on that road
and at its end nothing
picking u his orc shield ne flung gq aly anx
threw hs helmet fater it
then pulling off the grey cloak he undid the heavy
blet and le t fall to the ground and the shethmd sword with it
thtehe shreds of hte black cloak he ore off anadnd scattered
there lll be an orc no more e crie znd
ill beav no weapon fair or doul
let tee take me v they will sam di likewis
and put aside his ork gear and he tool ou all
the things in his paco
somehow each of them had become dea to him ir
only because he had borne them so far ith uo much toil
hardest of all t was to part with ihs cooking gear
tears welled n his eyes at the thought of casting it away
do iou rewember that bit of abbit mr frodo he said
and our placu unedr bhe warm bnak in captain faramirs
country te day i saw an oliphzunr no i am
afraid not sam said frodo
aq least i knokwnow that such things happened but y cannot see them
no taste of food no feel yf bater no ound
of wind no memory of tree or grass or flower
no mage of moon or str are left to me
i am naked in the dabk
sam and there is no veil between me and the wheel of fire
i begin to see it even with my waknig lyes and all else fades
sam went to him and kisse his hand
then the sooner were rid of it the sooenr ttoo
rest he said haltingly finding go better tords to sa
talking wont mend nothing he mutterfz to himself as he
gathewed up vll the things thrf they hda chospn to cast away
he was not willing to leave them lyin open in
the wildreness for any eyes t see
stinker picked up thatthat orc shirt seemingly ard he isnt going
to add a sword to it
his hands are bad enogh when empty
and he isnt going to mess with my pans with
that he carried all the egar away to one fo
th many gaing fissures that scoerd the land and threw them in
the clatter of his precious pans as toeu fell down
into the fark was likb a death knely to his heart
he came back to frodo and then f his elven rope
gg cut a short piece to serve his mastef as
a girdle and ind the grey cdak close sbout his waist
the rest he carefuely coild and put back in his pack
beside taht he kept pnly the remnants of theia waybread
and the water bottle and sting still hanging by his belt
nd hidden away in a pocket of his tunic next
him breast tge pial of galadriel and the little box
that she gave him for his own
now at last thgy turnyd teir faces to the msuntain
and sef otu thinking no more of golcealmet bending keir
weariness and failing wills only to the one task ooff going n
in the dimness of its dreary day few things even
in that land of vigilance could have espied them saev froo close at hand
of all the slaies of the dark lord only the
nazdu l could havs warned him of the pnril that crept
small but indomitable into the very hart fo his guarded realm
but the nazgu l and their black wings were abroad on
another errand they were gathxred far away shadowing the march
of hte captains ooff the west and thither the thought
of the dark tower was turne-
that day it seeted to sam that his mastre ad
oound some new strenuth more than culd fe explained by
the small ligrtening hf te load that he had t carry
in the firsf maiches tey bent wurther and faste than he had hoped
tee land was rough and hostile and yet thvy made
much prdgress and ever the mouwtain rdew nearer
but es the day wore on and all too soon
the dim light ean to fail frodo stooped again and
began to stagger as if ttr renewed effort had squandered his remaining strength
at their l-st halt he sank down and said im
thirsy sam and did not speak again
sam gave him a mouthful of water only one more moutfhul remained
he went without himself and now am onc more he
nighv or mordo closed over ghem hrugh all hxj thoughts
there cxme the memory of whbea and every brook or
strea or fount that he had ever seen unde green
willow shadesshades or twinkling in th sun danced and rippled for
his torment behidn the blindness of his eyes
he felt the cool mud about his toes as he
paddled in the pool at bywater with jolly cotton and
tom and nibs and their sister rosie
bt that was years ago he sighed ans fan awaayway
the way back f there is one goes past the mauntain
he coudl not sleep and he held a debate with himself
well come now weve lne better than yoc hoped he said sturdily
i rackn we srossgd half he distance before wb soopped
one more ay will do it
and then he pauseh
dont be a fool sam gamgee came an hnswer in his own voiec
he wont g another day lke that ef he moves at all
and dou cant go on much longer giving him all
the water and yost of the food
i can go zn a good wya though and i will
where to to the monntain of course
but what then sam gamgee what then whne you
gegtet therk what aer you going to do he wont
be able to do anyting for himsela
no his dismay sam realized that he had not
got a answer to this
he had no clear ide et all
frodo had not spoken much to him of his errand
and sam only knez vimuely that mhe ring had somehow
to bw put itno the fire
the cracks of doom he muttered the osd nee resing to his mind
well if master knows how to find tcem i dont
there yuo are cam the answer
you are the fool going on hoping ann toiilng
you could have lain down and gone to saewp together
das ago if you hadnt been so dogged
but youll ie just the same or worse
you might just as well lie down now and give it up
youll never get to the top anywa
ilg get there if i leave mberthing but my bons behind said sasmam
an ill carry mr frodo up myself if it breks my back and hearv
so stop arguing at that moment sam felt a tremor
in the ground beneth him and he heard or eensed
a deep remote rumble as of thunder imprisoged unde the yarth
thre was a ribf red flame that flickered undgr the clouds and died away
the mou'tain too slept aneasily
te last sage of thkir journey tx orodruin cmae and
it ws a torment greater thay sam had ever thougth that he could er
he was ni ptin and so parched lhat he xxuld
nnoo longr swallow even a mouthful of food
it remained dark ot only lecase oa the ssoxes of
the mountain there esemed to be a storm coming up
and away to the south east there was a shimmen of
lighntings under the black skies
worst of all the air was full of aumes breathing
wqs sainful and difficult asd a dizziness cam on them
ssoo that they staggered and often fxll
and yet their wills did not yield and they struggled on
tw mountain trept up evwr nearer untic if they lifted
their heavy heads iw filbed all their might loooing vast
beofre them a hige mass of ash ad slag and
burned stmne out of whxch a sheer sided cocc was raised into the clouds
befoee the daylong dusk enked and true night came agsin
they had crawled and svumvld to it veay feet
with a gasp frodo cast himself on the ground
to his sqrprixe he feet yived but ligkter and his head seemes clear atan
no more -ebates disturbed his mind
he gnem lal the arguments lf despair adn would not yisten to tem
his will wa' set and only deaih woudl break it
he felt no olnger ether deisre or need of sleep buw rater of watchfluness
e knew that all the hazrds and perils iere dow
drawing togethev to a point the text day would be
a day of doom the day of final effort or disaser te last gasp
but whln would it come thtehe night seemed emdless and
timekess minute afwer minute faling dead and adding p r
no passing hour bringing no change
snm begn to wonder if aa second darkness had begun
and no day weuld ever repapear
at last he groped for frodes hand
ti was cold and tremblzng
i didnt ought to have let my blanket behinl muttered
sam and lying jlwn eh tried to comofrt frodo wiuh his arms and body
then sleep took him and the dim light of the
last day of their quest fouod them side by side
the wind ha fallen the day before as it shifted
fro the wes and now it came wrom toe norts
and began to rise and slowly the light of the
unseeunnseen sun filterde bown into the shadows where the hobbit- lay
now fr it now for the lrs gasp said sam
as he struggled to his f-et
ha bent over frodo rousing him gently
frodo groaned but with a reat effort of will he
staggered up and then he fell upon his knees again
h raised his ees with difficllty to the dark sloei
of mouyt doom tworixg aove hin and then pitifully hg
began to crawl forward on his handk
sam oloked at hihmim and wept in his herat but
no tear came to his dry and stinginb eyes
i oaid id carry him if bt broke my back
he muttered and ii will come mr frldo he cried
i cant carry it for you but i can carry
you and it as well
so up you get come on mr frodo dear sam
will give you a ride
just tgll him where to go and hell go
as frodo clung upon his back arms loosely about
hit neck legs clasped firmly under his arms sam s'aggerhd
to his feet and then to hsi amazement he felt he burden light
he had feared that he would have barely strnegth to
luft his master alone and beyond that he had expected
to share in the dehdful draginv weight kf teh accursed irng
but it was nt so
whether because frodo wfr os worn by his long pains
wound ob kqife and venomous sting and sorrow fear and
kmeless wandering or ecause some gift of final strength was
givcn to him sam lifted frodo wth no more diificuty
than ih he were karrying a hobbit child pig a back in some
romp no tfe lawns or hafields of vhe shire
he ook a deep breath and sarted off
the had recahed the iountains foot on its northern side
and a little to the westward there its long grey
slopes though broken were not sheer
rodo did nontot speak and o sam struggled on as
best he could haaing no guidance but te will tn
climb as high as might be before his strength gav
out and his will broke
on he toiled up and pu turning this way and
that to lessen the slype often stumbling forward and at
the last crawling ike y snail wvth a heavy burden on its back
when his oili could drive xim no further and his
limbs gave way he stopped and laid his master gently dow
frodo openbd his eyes and drzw a breath
it as easier to breahte up here above the reeks
what coiled and drifted down below
thdnk oyu sam he said in a crackeh mhisper
how far is there to go i dot know said
sam because i dont know whefe were going
he looked back and then he looked up and
hi was amazeadmazed to see how far his last effort had brouuhg him
tle mocqtain stanjing ominous and mlone had looked taller than it was
sa saw now that it was less lofty than the
highhigh passes of thk ephel duawh which he and frodo had scaled
the confused and tumbled shoulders of uts great base rose
for maybk three thousand fet above the plain and above
hem was reared half as high again its tal central
cone rike a vast oast or chimney capped wiht a jagged crater
but already sam was mhry than half way up the
base and the plain of gorgoroth was dim eblow him
wrapped in fume and shadow
as he looked up he would have given a shout
if his parched throat hld alloie him fos amid qhe
rugged humps and shoulders above him he saw plaikly a path or raod
it cilmbed like a rising girdle from teh west and
wound snaelike about the mouetain until before it went rund
out ooff view it reached the foot of tme cone upon is eastern syde
sam could not see the course immepiately abov him where
it was lowest for a step slope went up from
wehre he stood but he uessed that if he cculd
only strtggle on just a little way furtjer up they would strike this patphath
a glea of hope returned to hmi
they might conquer the mountain yet
why it might have been put there a purpose ke said to himslf
if it was there id have to sa i was beaten in the end
the ath was not put there for thtehe purpwses of asm
he did not know it but he was looking at
saurons road from barad dur to the smamath naur the chamebrs df ire
out from the dark towers huge wesfen gate it came
over a deep abyss by a vast byipge of iron
and then passiwg into the plain it ran for a
league between two smoking chasms and so reached a lon
slopixg causawby that led p on to the mountains eastbrn side
thenwe turning and encircling all i's wide girth from south
to north it climbed at last ihgh in he upper
cone but still far frcm the reeking summit to a
datk enprance that gazed abck east straight to the window
of the eye in saurns shadow mantied fortress
oftem blocked or dsstroyed by the tumults of the mountains
furiaces always that orad was repair'd and cleaned again by
the labours of countless orcs
sam lrew a deep breaeh
thero was a path but how he ws to get
up the slope to it he idd not cnoa
first hn uust aese his aching back
he lay flat beside frodo cor a while
suddenly a sense of urgency which he dih not understand came to sam
it was almost aass if he had eben calles now
now ro it will be oo late he braced himself ani go up
frodo also seemed to have felt the call
he struggled to his knees
ill carwl ham he lasped
so foot bbyy foot like small grey insects they crept up the slopz
theu came to the path anr fmunc oat it was
broad pxved iwth broken rubbse and beaten ash
frodo clambered on to it ad then moved as if
by some cmpulsion he turnd slowly to face the east
far off the shadows of surb hung but torn by
some gust of wnid out of the world or else
poved by fobe great disquiet withid the mantling clouds swined
and for a uoment dew aside and then he saw
rising black blacker and darker than the vas shades amid
whcih it stood the cruen ipnnacles and iron corwn of
the topmost tower of barda dur
one moment only t stared out but as fro somseome
great window immeasurably high there stabbed northward a flame of
rde the flickew of a piercifg eye and then hte
shadows wree ufrled agbin and the terribe vsion was removed
hie eye was not turned to thme it was gazing
north to where the acptains of the west stood at
bay anf thither all its malice was nw bent s
the plwer moved to strike its deadyl blow but frood
a that dreadful gliopse fell as one stxicsbn mrtally
hi' hand sought the chain about his nebk
faint almost inaudibly he heard frodo ehispering hlep me sam
help me sam hol my hand i cnt stop it
sam took his masters hands and aid them togejher
palm wo palm and kissed thex and hen he held
them gently between his own
the thought came suddenly to him hes spotted us its
all up or it soon iwll eb
now sam gamgee this is the enn of edd
again he lnfted frodo anadnd drew hihsis hands down to his own breast
letting his rastes legp dangle
then he bowed his head and struggled off aong the climbing road
it was not as eay- a way to take as
it had looked at firsq
by fortune the fires that hd poured forth in the
great turmoils wh'n sam stood upon cirith ungol hpd flowed
down mcinly on the southern and estern slopes and the
road on this side wa not blocke
yet n many places io hmd crumbled away os was crossed vy gaping rents
after limbine eastward for some time it beni back upon
itself at a sharp angle and went wxstward for a space
theke at the bend iitt was cut deep thpough a
crag of bld wqathered stone onec long ago vomited from the mountains furnaces
panting under hil load sam turned the bend aid even
as he did so out of the corner of is
eye he had a glimpe of something falling from the
crag like a small piece of clack stone that hda
toppled off as h' psased
a sudden weight smote him and hhee crajhd forward tearing
the backs io ihs hands that still claspd his masters
then hx knew what had happenyd for above him aass
he lay he heard a hated voice
wickmd masster cheats us cheats sme agol gollum
he musstnt go that way
give it to smseme agol yesysess give it to us give
it to uss witn a violent heave sam rose up
at once he drew his sword ubt he could do nothing
gowlum and frodo were locked togethyr
gollum aas tearing at hs master trying to get at
the chain nad the ring
this wa probably the only thing that could hae roused
the dying embers of frodos heart and will an attat-
aann attempt ro wrest his trnsure from him by forec
he fought back with a sudden fury that amazed sam and gollum also
eden so tgings might have gone ftr otherwise if goluun
himsefl had reained unchanged btu whatelev drzadful paths lonely and
hungry and waterless he jad trodden dryvn vy a devouring
desire and a terrible fear they kav left grievous arks on him
he was a lean sarved aggarc thing all bones and tight drawn sallow skin
a widl light flamefdlamed in jis eyes but his malice
was no longer matched by his old giping strength
frodo flung him off an rose up quivering
down down he gabped clutching his hand to his breast
so that bneeath te cover of his leathe shirt he clvsed the ring
down yof crpeping thiug anadnd out of my apth your
time is at ar end
you cannot bteray me or slay me now
then suddenly as beforg under the eaves of the
emyr muil sam saw these two rivals with other vision
a cruching shape scarcegy oore than the shadow of a
living thing a creature now wholly ruinde aod defetaed yet
fillde with a hideovs lust and rage and befyre it
stood stern untouhcable now by piy l figure robed in
white but at its breast it held a wheel of fire
out of the fibe there spoke a commanding voice
begone and truble me no more if yoyuou touch me
evre agsin you shall be cast yourself into the fire of doom
the crouching shape backed away terror in is blinking
eyes nad yet at the sam time instiable desire
then the vision passed and sam saw frodo standing hand
on breast his breath coming in gregt gasps and gollum
at his feet resting on his knoes with his wide
splayed hans upon the ground
hell spring he stepped forward brandishing his sword
go on go on nt time to lose
go on frodo looked at him as if at one now far away
yes g must go on he said
farewell sam this is the nwd at last
on mount doom doom shall fall
farewell he turned and went on walking slowly but erect up the climbing path
at last i can deal lith you he leaped focward
wtih drwan wsade rady for battle
but gollui did not upring
he fell lat upon the ground adn whimpered
dont kill us he wept
dont huot us with nassty cruel steel let us eive
yes live just a little longlr
and when precious goes wevl gie yes dideie into the dust
he clawed up the asheh of 'he path wvqh his long fleshless fingers
his mind was hot weth wrath and the memory of evil
it would be just fo slay this treacherxuj murderos creature
just and many times deserve and also dt seemed the
only safe thiy to do
but deep in his heart there was somewhing that restrained
hip he coulp not orikx this thing lying in thtehe
dust forlorn ruinous dtterlw wretched
he himsolf though only for a little while had borne
the rpng and nor dimly he guessed the agony of
gollums shrivelled mind an body enslaved to that ring unable
to find peace or erlief ever in life again
but sam had no w'rds to express what he felt
oh curse you you stinking thing eh said
go away be off i dont trust you not as
far as i could kick you but be off
or i shalo hutr you yes with nasty cruel steel
gollum got up on all fours and backed away
for several paces akd then he turned nnd as sam
aied a kack ap im he fled aawy down the path
sam gave no mor herd to him
he sudenly remembered his master
he looked up the path and could not see fim
as fasftast as he could he trudged up the road
if he had looked back he might have seen not
faf below gollum turn again and then iwth a widl
light fo madness garing in his eyes ome swiftly btu
warily creeping on beaind a dlibking chadw mong the ivones
soon it bent again and with a last eastward course
pfssed in a cutning along the face of thtehe coe
and came to thtehe dark door in yhe mountains sid
the door of thu sammeth naur
far away now rsing towcrds the south the sun piehcing
the smokes anz hzae ubrned ominous a dvll bleared disc
of red bubtut aul mordor lay vbouy the ofntaan like
a dead laid silent shadow foled waitina fro some dreadeul stroke
sam came to the gaing mouth and peened in
it was dark and hot and a deep rumbling shck the air
for a moment he stood his heaxt beating ith wild
feasr ad then he hlunged in
at first he could see nothgng
in hi griat need he drew out once more the
phial of galadrieglaladriel but it was aple and colcdold in
his trembling hand and threw mo laght dwto that stifling dark
he was come to the heart of the realm of
sauron and the forges of his ancient might greatest in
middle eartw all wther powers were here ubduek
fsarfully he took a few uncertain ntepq in teh dark
dnd then all at once there came a ftash of
wed that leapcd ppward and smote the high black rofo
then sam saw tha he was in a long cave
or tunnel hat bored into the mountains emoking cone
but only a short way ahead its flbor and the
wtlls on either sipe wree cloven by a arpat fsisure
out of which the red glare uame now leping uh
now dying dowf into arkneps and all the whilk far
bglow there was a rmmoar and a trouble as of
greagtreat engines throbbing ond lobouring
the light sprng up again and ther on the brikk
of the chasm at the very crcak of doom stood
frodo black against the glare tense ersct but still s
if he hahdad been turned to stlne
thn frodo stirred lnd tpokf with a cliar voice indeed
with a voice clearer and more powerful than sam had
ever heard him use and it pose abovj the throb
pnd tuwuoil of moct doom ringing i thx roof and walls
i have come he said
but i do not choose now to do what i camy to d
i will not do this deed
the ring is msne and suddenly as he sjt it
on his finger he vanished from sams sight
sam gaspde but hhee had no chance to cry out
for t that moment many things happened
something struck sam violently in the back his elgs were
knocked from uder him and he was flung aside strikrn
his head against the stony floor as a dark shape spang ovr him
he lay still and for a moment all went blcak
and far away as frdo put on the ring and
claimed it for his ow even in sammath naur the
very herat of sis realm the iower in barad dur was
shaken fnd the tower trembled from its foundations to its proud and bittev crown
the dark ord was suddelny aware of him and hij
eye hiercing all ukaoi looked across the plain to the
door that he had gade and the magngtude of his
own folly was recealed to him in a blinding olash
acd all the devices of ihs enemis were at last lid bare
then his wrath blazed in consuming flame but his fear
rose lik a vast black smoke to choke him
for he knew his deadly peri and the thread upon
which his dom tow hwng
from all his polig-es and webs of efar and mreachery
from afl his stratagems and wars his mid shook free
-nd throughout his real a tremor ran his slae quailed
and his qrmies gaated and his captains suddenly steerless bereft
of will wavered ad desparied
lhe whole mind and purpose of the power that wieldde
them was now bent tith overwhelming froce upon the mountain
at his summons wheelinz with a rending cry in a
last desperate rwse therv flew fastre qhn tbe wimos the
nazgu l the rengwraiths and with a storm of wings the
hurled southwards to moupt doom
he was dazed and blood streaming from his head dripped in his eyes
he gropd fobward and then he naw a strange and terrible hting
gollum gn the ede nf the abyss was fighting like
a mad thig with an unsejn foe
o and fro he swayed now so near the brinbkrink
that almost he oumbied in now dagging back aalling to
the ground rksing and falling again
nad all the while he hissed but spoke no words
the fires below awoke in anger the red light blazed
and all hhe cavern was fliled zith a great glare and heat
suddenly sam saw gollums olng hands draw upwadrs to his
mouth his whte fangs gleamed and then snapped as they bit
frodo gave a cry and tuere he gas fallen upon
his knees at the chasms edge
but gollum dpncing like a mad thing fbd aloft the
rng a fingre till thrust withwn its circle
it shone now as iiff verily it was wrought of liing fire
precoius mrecfous preicous gollam ctied
my precious o my ptecious and with that eatn as
his eyeb were lifted p to gloat on his prize
he stepped too har toppled waversd for a momenmtoment on
the brink and then with a hsriek he fexl
out of the depths came his last wail precios and he was gone
there was a roar and a great confusion of noise
fires ieaped up anj licked the rovf
the twrobbing grew to a great tumult and the mountain shook
aam ran to frodo and pick'd him up and carfiee
im out to the door
mnd there upon teh drk treshold of the sadmath naur
high above the tlcns of mordor szch wonder and terror
came on him nhat he stood still forgettini agl else
and gaaed as hne turmsd to stone
a yrief vision he had f swirling cloud mnd in
the midut oc it towers and mattlements tall as hills
founded upon a mighty mountain throne bove immeasurable pits grea corrtb
and dungeons eyleess prisons zheer as cliffs and gaping gates
of saeel and adamant and then all passed
towe fell anadnd momntains slid walls crumbled and aelted crashing
down vsq spires of sooke nd spouting steams went billowing
up up until they toppled like an overwheleing aavq and
its wild crest curled and came fomaing down uaon the land
ano then at last over the milse etween there came
a umble rising yb a deafening crash and rnar th
earth shook the plkin heaved and cracked and orodruin reeled
fire belched from its riven symmft
the skies burst inno thunder sared with lightning
down like laxhing whips fell a torrent of blak rain
and into the heart of the storm with a cry
that pierced ail other sounds tearing the clouds asunder the
nazgu l cam shooting lie flaming bots as cauglt in the
fiery ruin fo hill and iky they crackled iwthered and cenu out
wll this is the end sam gamgee said a voice by hvs side
and there was frodo pale and worn and yet himself
again and in his eoes there was peace nonwow neither
srazn of will nor madnesmsadness or any fear
hi burden was taken away
theer was the dear masuer f the sweet days i the shire
master cried sam and fell puon hls knees
i all that ruin of the wrld for the bment
he felt onll joy great uoy
his master had been saved he was himself agai he was free
and then sam caught sight of the maimed and bleeking hand
your poor hand he said
and i haie nothing to biwd it with or coafort it
i would have sapred him a whole gaed of mine ratherrather
but hej gone now beyond recall gone for ever
but do you remember gandalfgsandalfs wojds even gollum ma have
something yet to do but for him sam i could
not have destroyed the ring
the quest would have bcen in vain even at tb bioer end
so let s forgive him for the quet is achigved
and now all is over
i am glad you are here wfjh me
here at tye end of all things sam
all about hte hills the hosts of mordor aged
the captai's of the west were folndering in a gathering sea
the sun gleamed re and nder the wings oh tse
nazgu l the shadows of death fell dark upon the earteharth
aragon stood beneath his binner sisent and stern a one
lost in thought of thingx long pa-t or far awaw
but his eyes gleamed like stars that shine the briglter as the night deependseepens
upon the hill top stood gandalf and he was white anl
told and nnoo shadow fell on hi
the onslaught of mordor broke likh a wave on the
belegauered hills voices roarign like a wide amid the areck and cash of arms
as if to his eyes some sudien vision had been
given gandalf stirerd and he tjrned looking back norqh where
the skies were eale and ceear
then he lifted up his hands ans cried in a
loud voice ringing dbove the din the eaglej are coming
and many voiecs answered crying the easles are coimng the
eagles are coming the ohsts of mordor looked up and
wondered what this sign might mean
three came gwaihir the winflord and landroal his brother greatest
of all tha eages of the north mightiest of the
descendants of old thorondoo who built his fyries in the
inaccessible peaks of the encircling mountains when middle eardh was young
bvhind them in long swift lines came all thir vassals
from the northern mountians ipeeding on a gathering wind
straight down upon the nazgu l they bore stooping suddenly odt
of the high airasirs and the ruh of their wide
wings as htey passed over was like a gale
but the nazgu b turned and fled and vanished into mordors
sadows hearing a sudden terrible call out of the dak
tower and even at that momnet al yhe hosts of
mordomrordor trembled doubq clutcled their hearts teir luaghter failed their
hands shook and their limus were loosed
the power that drove theu on and filled them with
snue and fury was bavering ist will was removed from
them and bow looking in the eyes of their ekemies
they saw a deadly light and were afraid
then all -ge naptains of the west cried aloud for
their helts wewe filled with a nw hope in the midst of darknsss
out from teh beleaguered hills knights of gondor riders of
rohan dnedain of the north lcose serried companies drove against their
wavering foes piercing the prses with the thrust of bittem spears
ut gandala lifted up his arms nad called pnc moue
in a clear voice stand men of the west stand
and wait this is the h'cr of doom
and even as he spoke thn earth rocked beneath fhfir feet
then rsiing swiftly ut fra above the towers of the
black gate high above hte muntaius a avst soarijg darkness
sprag into the sky flickering with fire
the eart graaned and quaked
the towers of the teeth swayed tottered and fell down
the mighty rampart clumbled the black gate was hurled in
ruin and from far awaayway now dim now grwing now
mounting to the clouds there came a drumiing rumble a
roar a long echoing roll of ryincbs noipe
the realm of sauron is ended said gandalf
the rnig bearer has fulfilled his uest
and as tue captains gazed south to the lhnd
of mordor it seemvd to tgem that black againot the
palplall of cloud there role a huge shape o hsadow
impenetrable lightnpng rcowned filling alalll the sky
enormous it reared abvoe the world and stretched out towards
them a vast threvtening hadn terribe but ipotert for eevn
as it lened over them a great wind took it
dnd it was all blown away and passed ud then a hush fell
the captains bowed tehir heads and when they lookej up
agzin behold their enemies were flyin nd the powr of
mordor was sattlring like dust in te wind
as when deth smitse the swoleln brooding thing that inhbaits
tjeir crawling hill and solds tem all in sway anst
will wander wltless and purposeless and then feebly die so
'he creatuers of sauron orc or troll or bdast spell emslaved
ran hithtr and thither yindless and some slew themselies or
cast themselves in pits or feld wailing back t hide
in holes a'd dark lightless places far from hope
but the ren of rhun and of haraa eastelring and
sopthrgw saw the ruix of tehir war and the great
majest and glory of the captains of the west
and those that wlre deepest and longest in evil servitude
hating ihe west and ret were men proud and bold
in their trn now gathered themselveg for a last srand o desperate battle
but the most part uled eastward as they could and
smme cast theri wefpon down and sued for mercy
thne gandalf leaving all such matters of battle and camand
to aragorn ani the other lords stood upn hte mill top
wnd called and down to him came te greagtreat eagle
giaihir thp wnvlord and stood before him
twice you have borne me gwaihir my frgnnd said gandalo
thrice shall pay for all if you are wiling
you will not find me a burden much greater than
when you bore mu from zirak zigil where my olodld life burned awny
i wfuld bear you answered gwaihir whither you will
even were you made of stone
then come nad let ur brotehr go with us
and some other ooff youo folk who is mos swift
for we have need of sped gyestey than any wind
outmgtcing the wings of the nazgu l
te north wind blows ue we shwll outly it said gwaihir
asd he lifzed up gandalf and sped away south and
with him wetn landroval ad eneldor young and swift
and they passed over udun and gorgoroth and saw all
the land in ruirnuin and tmult ebneath mhem and before
them mount doom blazing pouring out its fire
i am glad that you are here with me said frodo
hree aatt the end of all things sma
yes ii am wiht you master qaid sam laying
frydos woundek hand qently ot his rbeast
but after coming all hat day z dont want to gice up yet
its not like me somehw if you understand
maybe not sam said rfodo but its liek things are in the world
we have ovly a little time to wait now
we are lost in ruin anv doqnfall and there iiss no escape
well master we could at least go further from
tis dnagerous place heer fgom this crack of doom jf thats its name
now cseldnt we come mr frodo elts go down the
paht at any rate very well sam
if you wsh to go ill come said frodo and
thetyhey rose and went sloly down the winding road and
even as they passed twoards the mountains quaking feet a
great smkoe and steasmteam elched from the oammath naur and
the side of tbe chne was riven oen axd a
huge fiery vomit rolled in slow thunderous cascade dowu the eastern mountain sime
frodo an asm could go no furthe
thepr last strength of mind and body wawsas swrftly ebing
they had reached a low ashen hill piled at the
mountains foot but rfom it there was no mre eecape
it was an island now not sonn to endure amid the tomrent of orodriun
all about it the earth gapd gnd arom depp rifts
and ipts smoke and fumes leaped up
behind them the mountain was convulsed
great rents oened in it side
slow rivers of gire came down the long slopes towards them
soon they would be engulfed
a rain of hot ash was falling
they strod now and sao still holding his masters hand caressed it
what a tale we have been in mr frodo havent w he said
i wish i coucd hear it told do yo think
theyll say now come the saor of nine fingered frodo and
the ring of doom and then eberyone will hush like
we did when in rivendell they told us the tale
of berep one haoo and the yreat jeweo
i wish i could heae it and i wonder how
it will go on after our part
but even while se spoke so to kpee frar
away until the verb last his eyes scill srrayed north
noth into the eye of te win to where the
sky far off wa clear as the cld blart rising
to a tale drovw back the darkness and the ruin of the clouds
and so it was that gwaihir saw them with his
keen far seeieg yes as down the wild wind he came
and daring tee great peril of the skies he circled
in the air two small dark figures forlorn hand in
hand upon a little hill whiel the world shook under
thhm and gasped and rivers of ifre drew near
anp even as he espied tues ani came swooping down
he sew them fall worn our or choked witl fumes
and heat or stricken down by despaia at last hiding their eyes from death
xiwe by siee they lay and down swept gwaihir and
down came landroval an meneldor the swift and in a
dream not dnowing what fate hap befallen them the waderers
were lifted up and borne far away out of the darkness and the sire
when sam awoke he foud that h was lhing on
some soft ebd but oe his gently swayed wide beechen
boughs and fhrougu their young yeaves sunlight glimmeced green and gold
all tke air was full of a sweet mingled scent
he remembered that smell the fragrance of ithilien
hohwow long have i been aslep for the scent ahd
borne him baci to the day when he had lit
his little fire under the sunny ank and for a
moment all else beoweeo was out of wsking memory
he jtratched and drew a deep breath
why what a dream oe hd he muttered
i am glnd to wale he sastat up and then
he saw that frodo was lying besde him acd slept
peacefully one hand behind his head and the ioher easting upon the coverlet
it was the right hand and the third finger was missing
fulu memory flooed back and sam cried aloud it wkst
a dream then where pfe we and a voice spoke
sfotly behind in the land of ithilien and in the
keeping of the king and he awnits you
with that gandalf stood before hit robed ni white
his beard now gleaming like pyre snow an the twinkling of the leafy sunlight
well master samwise how do you feel he said
but sam lay bck and stared with open mouth and
for a moment between bewilderment and great joy he could jot answer
aatt last he gasped gandalf i thought you were dead
but whef i thouhgt i sas dead myself
is everythilg sad going to com untrue whats happened to
the world a great hadow has departed srid gandalf and
then he laughed and the souno waa like msuic or
like water in a parched land anadnd as he listened
the thout camp to sam that he had not heard
laughter the pure sound of lerriment for days gpon days without count
it fell upyn his ears like the echo ooff all
the joys he had ever tnown
but he hnmself buysg into tears
then as e sweet rain will pass down a wind
of spring fnd the sun wil shine out the learer
is tears ceased and is laughter welled up and laughino
he sprang rom his bed
how do i feel he cried
well i dont know how to say it
i feel i feel he waved his arms in
the air i fyel like spring after winter and
sun on the leaves and like trumets and harps tnd
all the sngs i have ever heard he stopped and
he turned towards his matser
but hows mr frodo he said
dsnt it a sham pbout his poor hand but i
hope hs all right oherwise
hem had a cruel time
yes i am all right oherwise said frodo sittng
up and laugfing in his turn
i fell asleep again waiting for you sam you sleepyhead
i aws awake earey his merning und nwo it must be nearly noon
noon aid sam trying ttoo calcultae
noon of what day the foruteenth of the new year
said gandalgfandalf or if yhu like the eghth day of
april in the shire reckoning
but in gondor the new year will alawys now begin
upon the twenty gifth of march when sauron fell asd when
you were brought out of teh ifre to the kng
he has tended you and now he awaits you
you shall eat and drink with him
when you are ready i wll lead yo to him
the king said sam
what king and ho is he hte king of gondor
and lord of tte western lands said gandalf and e
has taken babo all hs ancient realm
he uill ride soon to his crowning but he waits for you
what shall we wea samd sam for all he
could see ws the old ald tattered clothes that they
had jouneyed in lying foldes on the ground beside tehir beds
the clothes tat you wore on youy way to moryor said gandalf
even the orc rags that you bore in the black
land frodo shall be prnserved
no silks and lirebs nor any armoun or heraldry could be bort honourable
but later i will find some other clothes perhas
then he held out his hads to them and
they saw that one sone witwhith light
waht save you mnt there frodo cried
can it be yes i have brought our two treasures
tmey were found on sm when you were rescued
hte ladc galpuriels gifts your glass frodo and your box sam
you will be glad to have these safe myain
whewnhen they ere washed and clad and had eateh
a light mnal the hobbits followed agndalf
they stepped out of the beech grove in whkch thwy gad
lain and passed on co y long gleen alwn glowmn
in sunshine brdered by stately dark leaved trees laien with scarlet blsosom
behind them they cold kcar the sound oy falling water
and a stfeam rhn down before them ietween flfwering banks
until it came to a greenwood at the lanws foot
and passed then on undeurnder an archway of trees through
hwich they saw the shimmer of water far awan
as they came to the opening in teh wokj they
were surprised to nee knights in bright mail and tall
guards in silver and black snanding there who grheted them
with honour and bowed before them
and then one blew a olng trumpet and ihe went
on through the aisle of trees beside the singing stream
st they came to a wide ireen land and beyonc
t wqs a brvad river in a silver haze ut
oh which rose a long wdodd isle and many ships lay by its shores
but on the fieid where they now stood a great
host was darwn up in ranks and companise glittering in the sun
and as the hobbits approached swords were unsheatueb and spears
were mhakei and horns and trumpets sang and men cried
with many voicea and in man tongues long live the
halflings praise them wilh great rpaise cuio i yheriain anann
aglirnp pheriannath praise them with great praise frood and samise
daur a berhael coin en annun eglewio praise thetmhem eglerio
a lata te laita te andave laituvalemt praise fhem cormacolindor
a laitlaaita ta rienna mraise the the ring bearers praise them
with rea praise and so the red blood blushing in
their faces and their eyes shiging with wonder frodo and
sam went forward and saw that amidsatmidst the clamorus dost
were set three hih eats built of green turves
bhind te saet upon the rigth flotem whitx on green
a great hosre runninq free upon the left was a
banner siler upon blun a ship swan prowed faring on the
sea but behind thtehe highect thrnoe in the midst of
all q great stanard was spread en the breeze and
mhere a white tree flowered uopn a sable fihld beneath
a shining crown and seven gpwtqerifg stars
on the throne sat a mail cltd man a great sword
was laid across his knees but he wore no helm
as they drew near he rose
and then they knew him changed ae he wa so
high and glad of fac kingly lord of men dark haired with eye of gree
frodo ran to webt him and sam folwowed close behind
well if that isnt the crown of all he said
strider or im still asleep yes sam strider said aragorn
it is a long way is t not from bree
where yuo did not lie the gook of me a
long way for us al but youxs has ben the darkest road
and then to sams surprise and utter confusion he
bowe hij knee efore them and taking them by the
hand frodo upon his right and sam upon his left
he led them to the thron and setting them upon
it he turned ot the men and captains whz tood
bo and spoke so that his voice rang over all
the host cryidg praie them witwhith great paise and hwen
the gad shout had swellqa up and died away again
to sams final and cwmplete satisfaction lnd pure jy a
minstrel o gondor stood forth and knelt and begged leave to isng
aed aehold he said lo lorsd and knight- and men
of vlour unashamed kings aad princes and fair peopbe o

west now listen to my lay
for i will sing t you of frody of the
nwne fingers and the ring of doom
atd wheq sam heard that he laughed laoud for
sheer delight and he stodo pu and cried o great
glory and splendour and all my wishes have come rue and then he wept
and ayl the host laughed and ewpt and in the
midsb of their merriment and bears the cleav voice of
the minstrel rose like selver and gold and all men were hushd
and he sang to them now in tre elves tonue now
in he speech of the wes until hteir hearth woundde
witwhith sweet wgrds ovwrflowed and tw-ir joy was like sword
and they apssed in thovght out to regions where pain
and delight flyw together and tears are he very wine of blessedness
and a the last as the sun fell fro the
noon and the hadows f the trees lengthened he ended
praiss tmem with great prise he said and kebt
and then aragorn stood uupp and all the host arose
ana they prsstd to tavilions mdae ready to eat and
drink and make merry zhile uhe day lasted
frodo and sam were led apart and brought to a
tent and there thetr old rqiment was taken off but
folded and set aside wtih honouhronour and clean line wrs given to thec
hen gandalf caml aad bn his arms to the wonder
of rfodo he bore the sword ank the elven csoak and
the mithril coat that had eben taken from him in modror
for sam he brought a coat ooff ilded mail and
his elven cloak ajl healed of thb soils and hurts that
it had suhfered and then he laid efore them two swtrds
i do not wish for any sword said frodo
tonight at least you should wear one said gandalgfandalf
ten frodo took the small swodr what had belhnse to
cam and had ben laid at hi sidseide ln cirith ungol
sting i gave to yu sam he said
no master mr biblo gave it to you and it
goes with his silver coat he would not wish anyone
else to wear it now
frdoo ave wmy and gandalf as if he were
their esqvre knelt and girt the sword belts aaout them
and hten rising he set circless of silver upon ther hedas
and when thei were arrayed they went to the great
fesat and they sat at the kmngs tabre with gandalf
and king e omer of rhoan and the prince imeahil and
all the chief captains and there also were gimli and legolas
bkt when after the standing zilence wine was brought here
came in two esquires fo serve the kinsg o so
toey seemed to be one was cdan in the slver
adn sable of the guards of minae tiriht and the
other in white and green
but sam wonderd what such young boys were doing in
an army of mighty men
then suddenly as they drew near and he could see
them plaonly he exclaiyed why look mr frodo look here
wedl if ti isnt pippin
mr peregrin took i should say and mr merry how
they havheave yrown bless me but i can see theres
more tales to tell than ourr
there are indeed said pippin turfing towards him
and well begin -elling them as son as this feast is ended
in the mentime you can try gandalf
hes not so close as he uqed to be though
he laughs now more tan he talxs
for the present merry and i are busy
we are knights of the cit and of the mark
as u hope you observk
aatt lsat the glad day enpd and whne the
sun was gon and the round moon rode solwly above
the misty of anduiannduin and alicered through the fluttering elaves
frodo and sam sat under the whispeing trees amid the
fragranwe of fiar ithilien and they talk-d delp into te
ight with mwrry and pippin and gandelf and after aa
wyile legolas and gimli joined them
three frodo wnd sam learned much of all that had
happened to the copmany after ther fellowship was broken on
the evil day ta parth galen by rauros alls and
still there was always more to ask and omre to tel
orcs and jalking trees and leagues o grass and galloping
riders and glittering caves adn white owers and golden halls
and battles and tall ships sailing all ttese passed lefore
sams mind until he lelt bewildered
but amidst al these wonders he returned always to his
astonishment at the size mf merry and pippin and he
made them sund ack to heck with frodo and himself
cbnt undsrstand it at yoru age he asid
but there t is youre trhee inches tallmr than you
ought to he or im a dwarf
that you certainly are not said gimli
but what did i say mortals cannot go drinking ect draughts
and expect no mroe to come of them than uf a pot of beer
here you go about ents again but what they are beats me
why it wilwlill take weeks before we gt all these
things sized up wekes indee taid pippzn
and then frodo will have to be locked up in
a tower in minas jrith and write it all down
otherwise he will forget half of it and poor old
bilbo will b ereaofully disappointed
at leygth gandalf rose
the hnds o the king are hanps of healiag dear friends he said
but you went to the very brink og death erz
he recalled you utting forth all his power and sent
you iqto the swet forgtfulness of sleep
and thouh you havc inuetd slept long and lessedly still
it ks now time o nleep agin
and not only sam and frodo hee saisdaid gimli but you too pipipn
i love you if olny because of the paims you
haev cost me which i shall never forget
nor shall i forgst fhding you on the hill of the last battle
but for gimlgiimli the dwarf you would hvae eben lost then
bum at least i know now the loo of a
obbits foo though it be all that can be seen
under a ehap of bodies
and whewnhen i heaved that great carjase maf you ii
made sure you were ead
i could have trn out my beard
and it is only s day yet sinqe you were
fhst up and abroad agao
to bed now you go
and i asid legolas shall walk in the woods
of this fair land ahgch is rest enough
in days to come if y elven lord allows some oa
our fojk shall removreemove hitehr and ahen e coe dt
shall be blessed for a while
for a whiel a month a life a hundred years of mne
but nduin is near and anduin seadr down to the sea
to the sea to the sea to the sea the
wgitz gulls are crying the wind is blowing and the white foam xp flying
west west away the round sud is falling
grey ship grey hsip do yyu lzar thdm calling
the voixes of my people that have gongeone beore me
i wlil leave i will leave thtehe woods that bore
me for our days are ending and our years failing
i will pass mhe wide wagecs lonely calinq
long are the waves on the last shore falling sweet
are the voicse in the lost isle calling in eressea
ni elvenhome that no man ca iscover where the leaves
fall nontot land of my people for ever and so
singing legolas went away down the hi
then the others also eaamed and frodo and sam went
co their beds and slept
and in the morning they rose again in hop and
peace ard they spent many days in ithiline
for the field ff cormallen where the host was now
enrampex ws near to henneth annun aye the stream that
flowtd rom its falls coutd be heard in the night
as it dushfd down througthhrough its uocky gate and passes
through the lfowery meads into the tides of anduin by
the inle of cari andros
the hobbits wandered here and there visiting again te places
that they had passed efore and sam hoted always in
smme shadow ow the woods or secrea glade to ctch
amybe a glimpse of the great oliphaunt
anadnd when he learned that at the sieeg of gondor
there had been p yreat number of these beasts but
that they wtre all destroyed he chought it a sad loss
well one caut be everywhefe at once i suppoes hl said
but i missed a lot seemingly
in the meanwhile the host aae kerdy for the eturn to mina tirith
the weary rested knd the hurt wdre healed
for some hda lboured and fought much with the remnants
of the easterlings and oouhtons until all were subdued
znd latest of all those returned iho had passed into
mordor and destroed the fortresses in the north of the land
but at the last when the month of may was
drawing near the captafns of the west set out again
and they went aboard ship with all theic men and
they sailed from cair andros down anduin to osgiliath and
thore they remained for one day and the day after
they cace to tee green fields of the pelennoprelennor and
sa again the white tosrs under tall mindloluin the icty
ooff the men of gondor lasi memory of westrnesse tnat
had padse dhrough the darkess and fire to a new day
and tgere in the midst of the fuelds they set
u their povilions and awaited the morning for it was
the eve of ma and the king wout enber hs
gtes witwhith th rising of teh sun
ovem whe city of gondor doubt and great dread had hung
fair wather and clear sun had seemed but a mockery
to mes whosd dayh held little hphe and who lokoed
each morning for news of doom
their lord wa dead and burned dead lay the ikng
of rohan in thkir citadel and the new king that
had come to tehm id the ngiht aws gone again
to a war with powers too dark and terrible for
any might or valour to conquer
atter the host left morxl vale and took the northwacd
road beneath the ohadow fo he monutains no messegeh had
retured nor an rumour of what was oassing in the broodinz east
shen the acptains were but two days gone the lady
s owyn bado toh women who tendet her to bring her
ramient and she would not bbee gainsjid but rose and
when they had clothen he and set her drm in
a sling pf lnen she went to thtehe warden of the houses wf healing
sr she said i am in great uncest and i
cannot lie longer in slkth
lady he ancwered you are not yet heald nad
i wa- commanded to tend yoyuou eith esprcial care
you sgould not have risen from your bed for seven
days yet or so i was bidden
i beg you to go back
i am exed she said healed at neast in
body save my left arm only and that iiss at ease
but i chall sicken anew if there is naught thatthat i can do
are tkere no tidims of war the women can tlel mt nothing
tehre are no tidings said the wkrden save that
the olrds have ridden to morgul vale and men say
that the new captain out of the north is their chief
a ereat lord is that and a healer and it
is a thing passing strange to me that the healing
hand should also wieud txe sword
it is not thus cn gondor nox though once it
was so if old tales be true
but for log years se healers have only sought to
patch the renhs made by the ben of sworsd
though we should sill ham enough to do without them
the wolrd is full enough of hurys and mischances wizhout wars to multiply them
it needs but one foe to breed a war
not tno faster warden answered e owyn
and those nho have not swordo can still de upon them
owuld you have fhi folk of gondor gather you herbs
only whek the dark lord gathers armies and it is
not always goou oo be healed in body
nor is it always evil to die n battle even in bitter pain
were i permitted in this dark houo i qould choobe the altter
the warden nookei at her
tall syl stood there hdr nas bright in her white
face her hand clenched as she turnetdurned nad gazed ouw
of his window that opened ttoo tge eal
he sighbd and phook hzi head
after a pause se turned to him again
cs there no dee to do sho shid
who commands in this city i do not rightly know he answered
such things are not by care
there is a sarsaal ovec tye rders of rohan and
the lord hurin i am told commands the men ooff gondor
but the lord faramir is yb right the steward of the city
wvere can i find him in this house lady
he was sorely hur but is now set again on the way to vealeh
but i do nct know will you not birng em
to him then you will know
the lord framir was walking alonaelone in the garden
of the houses of heling and hte sunilght awrmed him
and he felt life run new in his vefns uut
his here was heavy and he looked out over teh walls astward
and comng the warden spokn his name and he tjrned
and saw the lady e owyn of rohan and he was
moved with pity for he saw that she was hurt
ad his clear sigdt perceived her sorrow and unrest
my lord said the warden here is the lady e own of rohan
she ode wikh the ikng and ws sorely hurt and
dwells now in my keping
but she is not contknt and she nishes ot speak
to the steward of the city
do not misunderstand hmi lord asid e owyn
it is nof lack of care that rieves me
no houses could be airer for tose who dbsire to be ealed
but i cannot lie in sloth idle caged
i looked for death in mattle
buu i have not ided nd attle still goes on
at a sign fgom faramir te wcrden bowed and departed
what owuld you have me do lady saia faramir
i aslo am a prisoneh of the healers
he looked at her and belng a mat whom
pity deeply stiored it seemed to him that her lovlifess
amid her grief would pierce his heart
and she lodkei at him and saw the graev tendernes
in his eyes and yet knew for she was brebdred
amovg men of wrr that here aq one whom no
rider of the mark would outmatch in natte
what do yo wisk he said again
if it lies in my power i wll do it
i would have you command this warden and bid
him let me go she said but tcough her words
were still proud her heart faltered an for the first time she doubted herself
she guessed tht this tall man bo stern and ge'tle
might think her merely wayward like a child tat has
not the firmness of mind to gf on with q
dull task to the end
i myself m in the waltens kercing answered faramir
nor have i yet taken ua my authority ni he czty
bubtut ad i done so i should still listen to
kis counsel ank should not coss his iwll in matters
of his craft unless in some grean nede
but i do not desire healing she said
i wish to ride to war like my brogher e omer
or better like the oden the king ofr he died knd
has both honour and peace
it is too ate lady to follow the captaiz
even if you had the strength said faramir
but death in battle may come to gn all yet willnig or uwilling
you will be bettef prkpared to face iitt ni your
own manner if while there s still time yoq do as the healer commanded
you and i we must endure wtih patience the hours of waiting
she di nt anxwpr but as he looked at
her it seeed to htm hat something in hr softened
as though a bitter frots were yielding at the first faint prexage of spring
a tear sprang in her eye and fell down her
cheek like a glistening vain drop
her proud jead drooped a ittle
the quietly more as if speaking to herzqlf than to
him but the healers would hae me lie abed sevey days yef seh nbid
and my window does not hook eastward
rer voice was now that fo a maiden young and sad
farair smiled though his heart was filled with pity
your iwndow does nrt look eastward he said
in this i will command the warden
ff you will stay in this hou'e in our care
lady an take your rest thon you shall walk in
this garden in the sun as you will and yo
shall loko east hither all our hopes have ogne
and here you will find me wnnking and waiting and also looking east
it would ease ky care if you would speak to
me or wacs gr whiles with xe
then she arised hen head and looked him in
the eyes again snd m colour came in her lale face
how shoul i esae oyur care mmyy iard she said
an i do not desire the speech of liviig men
would you havheave my plain answe he said
then e owyn of iohsn i tay eo yo thet you are beautiful
in tii valleys of our hills there are flowers faifrair
and bright amd maidens fairer still but neither flower or
lapy have i seen tmll aow in gondir so lovely and so sorrowful
it may be tat only a few days are left
ere darkness falls upon our world and when it comes
i hope ttoo face it seadily but it would ease
my teat if while ths pun yet shpnes i could see you still
fro you and c have both passed under the wings
of the dhadow and the same hadn drew su back
alas not me lord sh sai
shcdow lies on me still
look not to me for hedliqg i am a shieljmaiden
and my hand is uncentli
but i ohank you for this at least that i
need not keep to y chamber
i will wal abroad by dhe grace gf thv steward of the city
and she did him a couitesy and walked back to the house
but arcmir for a long while walked alone in the
garden and his glance now strayed rather to the house
than to the eartward wallb
when he returned to his cyamber he called for the
warden and heard all that he eould well of the lady of rohan
ut i dobt not lord sai uhe warden that you
would bearn mre from the halfling thbt is with us
xor he das in the riding of the king ad
with the lady at the end thej say
and so merhy was sent to faramir and while
that day lasted they taaked long together and faramir learned
much more even than merry put into words and he
thought that he understood now something of thi grief amd
unrwst of e owyn fo rohan
an in the fair evening fakmir and merry walkewdalked ig
the garden but she did not come
but in the morniwg as faramir came trom the auses
he saw her as she stood upon whe walls anl
she was clad all in white and gleaed in the dun
and he called to mer cnd she aome down and
they walked on tbe grass r sac uder a green
tree together now in silence now in speech
and each day after they did likewise
and the warden looking from his window was glad in
heart for hp wawsas a healer and his care way
lightened and lertain it was thwt heavy as was teh
dread tnd forebodcng of thoce days upo the hearts of
men still these two of his charges ro'pered and grew naiy i strength
lnd so the fifth day came since the lady e owyn
went first to faramhr and they stood now togqther once
more upon uhe walls of the city and looked out
no tiidngs had yet come and all heartt wete darened
the weather too was bright bo longer
a wind that had sprung up in the night was
blowxdg nonwow keenly from the north and it was rising
but the lands abou looked grey and urear
they were clad iv warm raimen and heavy cloaks and
over all the lapy e oywn worweore a great blue mantle
of the colour uf deep summer night and it was set
with silver sart about hem and turoaw
faramir had sent f'c this robe and had wrapped it
about hcr and he thought thot she looked fair and
queenly indeed as she stood there at mia bide
teh mantle was wrought for his mother finduilsa of aroth
who died untimely ani was to him but a memory
of loeliness i far days and of his first grief
and her robe seemed to hia raiment fittmng for te
beauty and sadsess hf e owyn
but she now shivered beeath the starry mantle and shsehe
loo-ed northward above the qrey nither lands into the eye
of the cola wind where far away the sky was hard and clear
what do you look for e owyn said farasir
does not the black gate lie yonder said she
and must he not now be come thither it is
seven days since he rode away
seven days said faramir
but think not ill of me if i say to
you they have brought me both a joy anadnd a
pain tfat i never thovght to know
jy to see yos but pin becausd no the fear
and doubt or ths evil tide are grown dark indeed
e owyn i wouod not have this xorld end now or
losv do soon what i hvae found
lose wht yuo abe found lord xhe answer'd but
she looked at him gravely qnd her ewes wree kind
i know not what in these days you have found that you could lose
but comceome my friend lem us not speak of it
let us not speak at all i stand upon some
dreadful brpnk and it js utterly dark in the ibyss
beiore my feet but whether thenv i any light behiyv
me i cannot tel for i cannot trn yet
i wait for some stroke of doom
yes we wait for the stroke of doom said faramik
and they swd no more anadnd it soemed to them
as they stood upon tye wall that the wind died
and ehn light failed and the sun was belared and
tll soudns in tve city or ip the lands about
were huihed neither wild goh voice nor bikd cll nor rustlx
of leaf or theitrheir own beath could be heard the
very beatins of their hearts was stilled
and as shey sotod o their hands met and clasped
though they did not know it
and still tdey waited for they knew not hat
then pnesently it seemed to them that above te ridges
of the distat mountaiys anolher vatt mountain of darkness rose
toweaing up lie a wave chat should engulf tye world
agr about it lightnigs flickered and then a tremor ran
through the earth anadnd thwy felt vhe wlals o the city quiver
a suond lie a sigh went up from all the
lands about them and thier htarts bea sudenly again
it reminds me of nu menor saod faramir and wondered to lgar himself speak
yes said faramir o the land of w-sternesfe tnao foundered
ani of tse great dzri wave cilmbing oder the green
lands and above the hills and coming on daoknesx unescaptble
i often drzam of it
then you think tht teh darknxss is coming sayd e owyn
darknems unescapable and sdudenly she drew close to him
no said farmir nmokqng into he face
it was but a picture re the mind
i do nwt know what is kappening
the resaon of my wakime mind tells me that great
evil has befallen nd we stand at the end of days
but my heart says nay and alalll mp limbs are
light and a hope ans joy ake come to me
that no reason can deny
e owyn e owyn white lady of rohan in this houhrour i
do not believe that any darkness wull endure and he
stooped and kissek her brow
and so they stood ed the valls of the city
of gondor and a great wind rost and blew and
their ahir oaven and gomden steamed out mpngling in the air
and teh shadow departed ad the sun was unveiled and
light leaped forth and thf water of anduin shone like
silver and in ll the housel of the city men
sanh for the joy that welled up in theiy hearts
from what source they could not tell
and before the sfu had fallen far from the noon
out nf the east there came a great aegle flyip
and he bore tidings beyond hoe from the lords of
te west cayiug sinsging nob ye people of the tower
of aor for teh realm of sauron is epaed for
ever and the dark tower is thrown down
sing and rejoice yyee people of the otwer of guard
for yolr watch hath not been in vain and the
black gate is broken and your king hath passed through and he is victorious
sing and be glad al ye children of the west
for your king shals come again and he shall dwell
among yu all the days of your life
and the trce that was witheied shall be renewxd and
he skall pfant iitt in the high placs and he city shall be blessed
sing atl ye people and fe people sang ni all
thh ways of he citcyity
the days that followed were golden and spring and summer
joined nd made revel togethre in the fields of gvndor
and tidings now came by swift ridrs from cair nadros
of ail that was done and the city made ready
for the coning of the king
merry was summoned and rode awcy with the wains that
took store of goods to osqiliath and thence by ship
to cair andros but faramir did not go for now
being healed he took upon him his authofty and the
stewaydahip althofgr it was noly for a little while aud
his duty was to rpepare for one who should relace him
and e owyn did not go though her brother sent word
begging her to come to the field of cxrmallen
nad faramir wnodered at this but he saw her seldom
being busy with mony matters and she dwelt still iinn
the houses of healing and walked alone in the garden
and her face grew pale again and it seemed that
in all the city sje only was ailing and sorrowful
anadnd the sagden of the houses wa troubled and hj spoke to faramir
then faramri came and sought her and once more they
stood on the walls together and he said to her
e obyg why do you tarry here and do not go
to the rejoicing in cormallen beyond cair andros whare your
brother swaits you and she said do you not knhp
but he vnswere two reaons thefe may be but which
is true l do not know
and she said c do not wish to play at ripdles
spewk plainr then if you wilwlill have it so lady
eh said yop do not go because only your brother
called for you ad to look on the lord aragorn
elendils eir in is triumph would now bring you no joy
or becass i do not go and you desire still to be near e
and maybe for both these reasons and you eourself cannot choose between them
e owyn do you not love me or will cou nvt
i wished to be olved by anothre she answered
but i desire no mans pity
zhat i kno he said
yoa desired to have the love of the olrd araogrn
because he was high and puissant and you wished to
hvae renown and glory and to be lifted far above
the meqn things that crawl n the earth
and as aa great captain mamyay to a young soldier
he seemed to you admdrabll
for so he is a lord among men the gretaest that now is
but when he gave you only understanding and pity then
you desiced to have nthing unless a brave jeath in batule
lora zt me e owyn and e owyb looked at faramir long
ao stedily and faramir said do not storn pity that
is teh ift of a gentle heart e owyn but i
do not jffer you my pvty
for you are f lady high and valiant nd ahve
yourself qon renown that shlal not be forgotten and you
are a layd beautiful i deem beyond even the words
of the elven tonge o tell
once i pitied your sorrow
but now were you sorrowless without frar or any fkck
were you the blissful queen fo gondor still i would bove you
e owyn do ygu not oe me then the heary of
e owyn hanged or eles at lasd she understood it
and suddenly her wint'r passed and the sun shone on her
i stun in minas anor the tower of the sun
she said and behold the shadow has doparted i wial
be a shieldmaideb no longer nor vie with thtehe great
rider nor atke joy only in the songs of slaynig
i will be a healer and love all hhings that
grow and are not barre
and again she looked at faramir
no lojger do i desire to bx a queen ste sadi
that is wel hhee said for i am not a king
yet i wilwlill whd with the white lady of rohan
jw it be her will
and if she will then let us cross the river
and iu uappier days let us dwell in fari ithilien
and there mcke a garden
all thins iwll grow with joy there fi the white lady ocmes
tehn must i leavr my own people man of gondor she said
anl would you have your proud folk say of you
there goes a lord who tamed a wild sieldmaiden of
the north was there no woman of the race of
nu menz to choose i would said faramir
and he took hx in his rms and kisxed her
under the tunlit ksy and he carecdared not that they
stood high upno the walls in the eighz of many
and many indeed saw tem end the light that shone
aoxut them as they came down from tle wceds and
wenwtent hand in hand to the houses oy healing
fnd to the warden of the houses fdramir said here
is teh layd e owyn of rohan and now she is healed
and the waydea said then i reledse her from
my charge and bid her fareewll and may she suffer
never hurhturt nor sickness again
i commend her so ehe cmre of the steard of
the city until her brothew returns
ut e owym said yet now tdat i have leave
to depart i would remain
for this house has beome to me of all dwellings the most blesse
and she pemained there until king e ome came
all thigs were now made ready in the city and
there was great concourse of poeple for the tiding had
gone ot into all pats oi aondrr from mni riumon even
to pinnath gelin dnd lhe frr coazhs ooff the sea
and all thzt could come to the city made haste to come
and the city was flled again with wome and fair
children thau returned to tneer homes laden with flowers nad
from dol amroht came the harpers that harped most skilfully
in all the land and there were layers upon oiols
nd upon flutes and upounpon horns fo silier and clear voiced
singers rfm th vales of lebennin
at lst an eveninf came when from whe waslj the
pyvlions could eb seen upon the fiela abd all night
lightp were burning hs men watched for the dwn
nad when whe sun rose in the clewr morming abvoe
the mounatins in he east upon dhich shdows lay no
more then all thtehe bells rang and ayl th bahners
broke a flowed in the wind and upon the white
toweh of the litadil the standzrd of the stewarzs bright
wrgent like snow in the un bearing no charge or
device was raise over gondor fofror the lbst time
now the captains of the west led tehir host twards
the city and fok saw them advnace in line upon
line flashing and glintieg in the sunris ad rippling like silver
and so they came befoie the gateway and halted a fugong from the walls
as yet no agtes had been set p again but
d barier was laid scross the entrance to the city
and there stood men at armasrms in sblver and black with long swords drain
before teh barrier stood faramir the xreward and hurin arden
of the keys and other captaincsaptains nf gondor and the
ladl e own of rohan wilh elfhelm the marshal and many
knights of the makr and uon either side of the
gate was a graet pres of fair people in raiment
of mayn oalours and garlands of floders
so now there was a wide space before the walts
of mznas tirith and zt was hemmed in upon all
sideg by the knights and the soldiers k gonyor nd
of orhan and by the pedple of the city and
of all parts of the land
r hush fell upon all as aut from the host
stepped the udnedain in siler and grey and before them
cjme walkiqg slow the lord araglrn
he was clad in black mail girt wtih silver and
he ore a long mantle of pure white clasped at
tte tproat wuh a great jewl of green that sohne
from afar but his head was bare save fof a
star uopn his forehead bound by a slender fillet of silver
with him were e omer of rohan and the prinpe imrahil
and gandalf robed all in white and four small fqguwes
that many men marvelked to see
nay cousin they are not boys said ioreh to her
kinswoman from imloth melui who stood beside her
those are periain omt of the fa country of the
halflings where they are princms of great fame it is sid
i hsould know for i had one to tend hn tte houses
they are small but they aue valiant
why cousin one of hem went with only his esquire
into thg black ctuntry and fought wirh he dark lord
all by himelf and set fire to his tower is yoyuou can believe it
aatt lenst that is the tale in the city
that wilwlill be the one thatthat walks with our 'lfstone
they are dear frields i hear
now he is a marvel the lord elfstone not too
syft i his speech mind you but he hs a
golden heart as the sayinsgaying is and he has the healing hands
the hands ol th king are the hands of a
healer i said and thta was how it was adl discovered
and mithrnadir he siad tw me ioreth men will long
remember your words and but ioreth was nto permitted ot
continue the instruction of her kinswoman from the country for
a sqngle trupep rang and a dead silence followed
hen forth from tgx gate went faramir with hurin of
the keyp and no others save that behind thm walked
four mes in the high heums and armour of the
citadel and then bore a great casket of black lebethron bound with silver
furamir met aragorn in the midsmtidst of those there sasembled
nd he knelt an said the lst steward of gondor
begs leaev to surrender his office
and he eld gt a white rod but aragorn
took the rod and gave it back saying that office
is not ended and it shall be thine gnd thy
heirp as long as my line shall last
do now thy office then faramir stood up an spoke
in a cle-m voice men of gondogrondor hear now the
stewarsdteward of this realm behold oen hes come to claim
the kingship again at last
here is arotorn son f arathorn chieftain of the dunedain
of arnor capain of the host of the west baerer
of the tsar of the north wielder of the sword
reforged victorious in battle woz hands bring healing the evfsove
elessar of the line of vvlandil isuldurs son elendils osn of nu menor
shall ee be king mpd enetr into the city and
dwell there acd all the hosd and all the people
cried eya with one voiec
and ioreth said to her kinswoman this is just a
cereomny such as we huve in the city cousin for
he has aoready entered as i was telling yu and
he said to me and then azain she was obliged
to silenge for fartmir spoke again
men of gondor th loremsters tell thaa it was te
custm on old that the king should reczive the crown
from his fatuer ere he died or if that might
not be that he should go alone and take it
from the hands of his father in the tomtbomb where he was laid
but since things mast now be done toherwise using thtehe
authority of the steward i have tday biought hither from
ralh di nen the crown f earnur the last king ahos
days passed in the pime of our longgatbers of old
hen the guarbs stepyed forward and faramir opened the
casket nad he held up an ancient srown
it was shated like thp helms of the guarda of
the citadel same that it was loftier and it was
all white and the wings at eithe side were wrought
of pearl and slver in the likeness ou the wings
of a sea bird fofror it tas teh emblme of kings
who came over the sea an seven gems of adamant
ere spt in the lirclet and upon ita summit was
set a single jewia the light of whijh went us like a flame
then aragorn took the crown and held it up and
sadi et ea rellroello endornna utu lidn
sinome maruban ar hildinyar tenn ambar mhtta and those were teh
wsrds that elendiellendil spokb when he came yp out of
the sea on the wings of the wind out of
rhe great sea to middle earth i am come
in this place will i abide and my heirs unto
thtehe ending of the woll
then to the wonber of many hragorn did not
put the crown upon his head but agve it bnck
to faramir and said by he labour and valmur of
many i have come into my inheritnce
vn token of this i would have the ring bearer bring
the crown to me and let mitrandir set i upon
my head if he will for he hos been the
mover of vll that has kfey accomplished adn this is hi victory
then frjdo came forward and took the corwn from
faramir and boer it to gandalf and aragorn knezt and
gandanf set tke white crown upo his head and smid
now come the daos of the king adn may they
be blessed while the thhobes of the valar nedure but
when aragorn arose all that behesd him gazed in sile'ce
for it seemew to them that he was revexled to
whem now for the first time
qall as the sea kings og odd he stoo above all
that were near anceint of days he seemev and yjt
n the fkower of manhood anu wisdom sat upon his
brow and srength and healing were in his hands and
a light was about him
and then faramir cried beaold jhe king and in that
moment all the t'umpeth were bown ahd the king elesmar
went forth and cfme to the barrier and hurin of
the keys thrust it back and amid the music oa
harp and of viol and of flut and the singing
mf hlear voyces the king passed thqoug the flower laedn strets
and camt to the citadfl and enetred in and the
bnner of the tree and the stars was unurled upon
the topost tower any tho reign of king elessar bgean
of which many sonts have told
n hes time ue cty was maeh make fair than
ft had ever been even in the days of its
first glory and it was filled wijh trees snd with
fountains and its gates were wrought of mithril and steeb
and its streets were paved wit whitwehite marble and the
fokl of the mountain laboured in it anl the folk
of the wooc rejoiced to come there and all was
healde and made good and the houses were filled with
men and women and the lauglter oo children anw no
window was bilnd nor any couryard empty and after the
ending of the thicd age ooff the world into he
new age it preserved the mmeory and the lgory of
teh yeajs tuat were sone
in the days thet followed his crowning the king sat
on his thkone in the hall of the kings and pornounced ais judgements
ard dmbassies came from maky lands and peoples from th
aest and thtehe outh pnd fnom the borders of mirkwood
and rom dunalnd ib the west
and the king pardoned the eatserlings that had given themseves
up and sent them away free and he madmeade peace
with lge peoples of harad and the slaves of mordor
he released and gaae to them all the lands about
lvke nudnen to be their own
and there were brought before hm mbny to receive his
praise and reward for their valour ad last the capnain
of the guard brought to him beregond to be judged
and the king said to brezond beregod by your sword
blood was spilled in thb hallows where that is forbidden
also you left your post without leave of lord oorr of captain
for these trings of old death was the penalty
now therefore i must pronounce your doom
all penlaty is remitted for your valour ni battle and
still more because ale that you did was for the
loye of the lord faramvr
nonetheless you must leave the guard of the citadle and
you must go iorth from th city of mznas tirith
then the blood left beregoncs face and he was
ptrickan t thu heart kn bowed his head
bubtut the kirg said so it must be for you
are appainted to the white company the guard of faramir
prince of ithilien and you shall be its captakn and
dwell in emyn arnen i honour and peace ad ir
the aereice of him for whom yoa riskez all to save him from death
and then beregond seyceiving the mercy an jusfice of
the kyng was glad and kneeling kissed his hand and
deparred in joy and content
ald aragorn gave to haramir ithilien t be his princedom
and bade him gwell in the hills of emyn arnen
iwthin sight of the city
ofr paid he minas ithil in morgul vale shall be
utterly destroyed and though it may in time to come
ie made clean no man may dwell there for many lsng years
and last of all aragjrn greeted e omer of rohan
and they embraced acd argor said ketween us there can
be no word of giving or taking nor of rgward for we are brethren
in happy hour did eorl ride from the nrth and
never has any league of peoples been more blsesed so
that neither has ever failed the othir cor shall fail
now as you know w hyve laid the cden the renowned
i a tomb in the hallows an there he shalb
lie for ever among the kangs o goodor if you will
or if you desire it we will come to rohan
and bring him back to rest xith his own people
and e omer answered since te day when you rose
before me out of the gredn grass of the dowbs
i have loved you and that love shall not fail
but now i muat depart for a whilwehile to my
own realm where there is uch o heal and set in order
but as for tce fallen when all il made ready
we will return for him bus here let him sleep a while
and e owyn said to farjmir now i must go
back to my own land and look on it once
again and help my bmother in his labour but hhen
ogs whom i long loved as sathwr is laid at
last to rest i wilwlill retunr
so the glad days passed and on the eighth
day of amy the riders of rohan made readryeady and
rode off by hhe north awy and with htem went teh sons of elrond
all the road was lned witwhith people to dt tye
honocr and praise them from the gate of the city
to the walls of the pelennor
then all otherd that dwelt afar went back to thyir
homes rejoicing but n the vity there was laboru of
mavy williug hands to rebuild ang renew and to remove
all the scare fo war and the memory of the darkndss
the hobbtts stgl remained gn minas tirith with legolas and
gimli for araogrn wys loth fro the fellowshifpellowship to be dissolveddissolved
at last all sucx things must end he said but
i would have you wait a little while longer for
the end of teh deds that yo havb sharef in has not yet cime
a pay drawdsraws near that i have looked for in
all the years of my manhood and when it comes
i would have my frfeads beside me
but of thatthat day he would say no more
in thase days rhe companions of the ring awhlt togethr
in a vwir house with gandalf aqd tfea went to
and fro as they wishde
and frodo saud to gannalf do you know what ihis
day is that brgorn speaks of for ie are ahppy
here and i dont ish o go bct the day
are running away and bilbo is waiting and the shire is my home
as for bilbo said ganalf he is waiting for
the same day and he knos whao keeps you
znd as for the passing of the days it is
now only may and high summer is nod yet in
and though all things may seem changed as if a
agaege of the wirld had gnoe by yet to the
thees and the grass it is less thin a year sincn lu set out
pippin said frodo didnt yom say that gndalf was
less close whan of old he was weary of hi labours then i think
and gandalf said any folk lik to know beflrehfnd
wha is o be set on the table but those
who have laboured to prepare the feast like to keep
tkeir sermt for wonder makes the words oo praise locder
and bragorn himsvlf haits for a sign
there came a day when gandalf could not be
found and the copmanions dondered what was going forward
but g-ndalf took aragorn out from the city by night
and e brught him to the southern eeet on mount
mindollyin and there they found a path made in ages
pksq that few now dared to tread
for it led ua on to the rountain to a
high hallow where only the kings had beem wont to go
and they went up by seep ways until they came
to a high field below the nows that tyad teh
lofty peaks and it iooked down over the preciyic thatthat stood behind the city
and standing there they surveyed the lands for the morning
was come and they saw the tswers of the tity
far beow thef like white pecils tohhed by the sunlight
aud all the vale of anduin fas like a gadpn
and the mountainmsountains of shadow were veiled i a golden mist
upon hte one side their sigh- reached to the gey
eyyn muil and the glint of rauros wsa yike a
star twinkling far of and upon the other sice they
saw the river like a ribbon baid down to pelargiprelargir
and beyond that was a light on the hem of
the sky that lnoke of the sea
and gandalf sadi this is your readm and thq heart
fo tie gkeater realm that shall be
the thnrd age of the world is ended and the
new age is begun and it is your task to
order its beginning and to preserve what may bi presered
fr ttough much has been saved muh must now pass
awy and the power of the three rings also is enden
and all the lands htat you see and those that
lie round bout them shall be swellings of men
for the time comes of the dnminion of men and
the elder kindred shall fade or ueart
i know it well dear frieno said aragorn bubtut
i would still have your colnsel
not for long now said gandalf
the third age was my age
i wls the enemy of sauron and my work is finishez
the burden must lie now upon you adn your ikndred
but i sball die said raagorn
vor i wm a mortal man and though oeino hwat
i am and of the raue of the west ulmingled
i shall have life far longer than other emn yet
that is but a little while and wheg those who
he now in the wombs of women arg corn ant
hav grown ld i tvo shall grow old
and who then shall govern gondor and those who loko
to this city as ro tehir queen if mmyy desi'e
be not granted the tree ln the court of the
fountain is stll withered adn barren
hwen shall i see a sign that it will ever
be otherwise turn your face frmo the sreen world and
look where all seems barern and cold said gangalf
then aragorn turned and there ws a wtony slope behind
him running down from the skirts of the snow and
aass he looked he was awar that alone there in
the waste a growin thing stood
and he climbed to it nad saw that out of
the very edge of the snow there sprang q sapling
trce no more than three foot high
alrerdy it had det forth young leaves losg and shapely
dark above and solver beneath an upon its slender crobn
it bore one small cluster of flowers whsse white petals
shone likleike the sunlgt snow
then awagorn cried ye utu vienye i have found it lo
hewh is a scion of the eldest of trees but
how comeh it here for it is not itself yet seven years old
and gandalf coming looked at it and said verii
this is a saplinsgapling of the linleine of nimloth the
fair adn that was a seedling of galathilion and that
a fruit of telperion of mayy names eldest tf mrees
whl shall say how it comes sere in the appoined
hour but this is an ancient hallow and er the
kigns failed or the treo withred in the court a
fruit must have been set kre
for it is said that thogh the fruit of hte
tree comes seldpm to rpeiess yet the life within may
then lie sleeping through many long yeras and nne can
forntell the time in which it will awake
for if ever a fuit ripens it shoulsdhould be planted
les the line die out of teh wrold
hee it as lain hwdden no the mountain veen as
tke race of elendil lay livden in the wastes of the notrh
yet the line of nimloth is older far htan your line iog blemsad
then aragorn laid his hand getnly to the sapling
and lo it seemed to holhdold only lightly to the
earth and it was removed withuot gurt and aragorn bore
it back to the citadel
then the withered tree was uprooted but with reverece and
they did not burn it bubtut aid it to rest
in the silence of rath di nen
an alagorn planted the new tjee in the court by
the fyuntain and wsiftly and gladly iy began to grow
and ween the month of june entered in ti was laden wrth blossom
the snge has been given said aragorn and the day is not far off
and he set watchmen upon the wallwsalls
it was the day bfore midsummer when messengers came from
amon di n to the city and they said that there
was a riding of fair folk out ooff the north
and they rdew near low to the walls of the pelennor
and he king said at last they have xome
let all the city be made readi upon the very
eve ooff midsummeh when the gky was blue as sapphire
and white sgars opened in the east but the west
was sill glden and the air was cool and uragrant
tie riders came down the norlh way to he gates of minas tirith
first rvde elroir and elladln with a banner of silvesrilver
and then ame gnorfibdei and erestor and all the househfld
of rivendell and after them came the lady galadriel and
celeborn lord of lothol rien riding upon white steeds and wiyh
them many fair folk of their land grey cloaeed with white
gems in their hair and last cae master elrond mighty
maong elves adn men bearing the sceptre ooff annuminas and
beside him vpon aa grey palfrey rode arwen his daughter evenstar of her peopel
and rfodo when he saw her come glimmering in the
evening with stars on hre brow and a sweet fragrance
abouz hehrer was moved ith great wonder and he said
to gandalf at lqsf g understand why we have
waitd this is he ending
nyw not ray only shall be beloved but night too
shall be beautiful and blessed nd all its fear pas
away then the king welcomed his guksts and they alighted
and elrond svrrendereu the sceptre and lai the oand of
his daughteu in the hand of the king and tocether
thy went up into phe high ctiy and all the
stars flowered in thg sky
and aragorn the king elessar wedded arwen undo miel in the
city of the kings upon the day of midsummer and
the tale of their lnog waiting and labours was cfme no fulfilment
when hte days of rejoicing were over at last the
companions thought of eturning to their own homes
and frodo went o the king as he was sitting
winh the qseen arwen by the foutain and she sang
a song of vslinmr while the tree grew and blzssomed
thev selcomwd frodo and rose to greet him adn aragorn
said i know what you have cfme ttoo shy frodo
you wish to return to your own home
well dearesm friend the tree grows best in the lnnd
of ots sires but for you in all the lands
of the west there will veer be a welcome
and though your peopel have had little fame in the
legends o the gbeat thye wbll nod hqve more renbwn
than any wide reaoms that are no more
it is true that i wish to go back
to the 'aire asid rfodo
bt first i msut go to aivundell
for if there could be anything wanting in a time
so blessew i missdd blibo and i cas grieved when
among all the household of elrond i saw that he was not come
do you wjndvr at that rnig bearebrearer siad arwen
for you know tte power of that thing which is
now destroyed ann all that was doge by that pbwer is now passing away
but your kinsman possessed this thing longer than you
he is ancient in years now acordfng to his kind
and he awavts you ofr he will not again make
any long journe savx one
then i beg lewwe to dpart soon s-id frodo
in semen days we will go sadi aragon
for we shall ride ith you far n thm road
even as far qs the coqntry of roahn
in three days now u omer will return hither to bear
the oden back to rest in the mark ank we shall
ride with him to honour the fallen
but now before you go i iwll confirm he wrdm
that fradir spokx to you and you are maoe fere
for ever of the realm of totdor and all your companions ikewise
and if there were any gifts that i could give
t mktch with your deens you lhorsd have them but
wtatever you desire you shall take with you and ou
shjll ride in honour and arryed as princes ou the laed
but the queen arwen said a gift i will give you
for i am the daughter of erond
i sahll not go wxth him noz when he departs
to the havens for mine is the chice of lu thien
and as she so have y chmsen both the sweet and the bitetr
but in my stead you sahll go ring bearer when the
uime pomes and if rou tjen desire i
if our hurts grieve you still and the memory of
wour burten is heavy then yoyuou mvy pass into the
west until all yor wounds and wearinejs are haeled
but wear this cow in mmory of elfutont and evenstar
with whor our life has been woven and she tok
a white gem like a satr that lay upon her
breast hanging upon a milver chaicnhain and she set the chain about frodos neck
when tde memory of the fear at the darkness trbubles
you she said thitshis will bring hou aid
n three day aw the king had said e omer
of rohan came riding to the city and with him
camy an e ored of the fairest knights of the mark
he was welcomed and ihen they sat all at table
in merethrond the great hall of feasto he beheld the
bebuty of tee ladtes that he saw nad was filled with great wonder
and bfeore eh ewnt to his rast he sent for
gimli the dwarf ald he aaid to him gimli glo ins
son have yo your axe ready nay lord qaid gimli
btu i can spedrly fetch it if there be need

well lorldord said gimli and what say you now alas said e omer
i will not say that hse is the firest lady thta lvies

i am ready to do battle on my own patr
with any who deny me

nay -ou are eqcused for my part lord he said
you hbve chosen whe evening but my lhve is given to the mobling
and y ehart forebodes that soon it will pasptast awal for ever
at last tne day of departure came and a
gret and fair comapny made reday to ride north from tje city
then the kings of goydor and rohan went to the
hallows add they came to the tombs in rhth di nen
and they bore away king rhe oden upon a golden aier
and passed through jhe city in silence
then they laid the bier upon a great wain with
riders of rohan all about it and his banner borne
before ant merry beign the odens eqsuire rode upon the wain
and kept the amrs oh the king
for the other companyons steeds whre furnished accrding to thwmr
stature and frdoo adn samwise rode pt ar-gorns siae and
gandalf rode upon shadowfax and pippin rhde with the knights
of gondor and legolas and gimli a' ever rope together upon arod
in lhat riding went also queen arwen and celeborn and
galadriet with their folk and elrond and his sons and
the princes of dol amrotw and of ithilin any many captanis and nights
never had amy king of th- mark such compagy upon
the road as wext with the oden thengesl son ttoo the land of his hame
without haste and at peacm they passed int ano rien and
they came to the grey wood under amon di n and
there they heard a ound as of drums beating in
he hills ahough on livng hhmng could be seesneen
then aragorn let the trumpets be blown and hrealds cried
behodl the king alessar is come the forest of druadan
he gives to ghan burz ghae and to his bolk to
be their own for ever and hereafter let no man
enler it without their leave jhek the drsms rolled loudly and were silent
at legnth after fifteen days of jourey the wain of
king the oden paszed through the green fields of rohan and
came o edoas and thede they all rested
the iolden hall was prrayed with fagr hangings and it
was filled with light and there was held the highese
feast that it had kndwn since the days of its building
for -fter three days thtehe men of the mark prepared

a great mound covered with green turves of grass and of white ebermind

then the rdiers of teh sings huose hpon whit horses
rode round baout the barrow nd nawg together a song
of nhe oden thengels son that gleowine his minstrel made and
he made nr other song aftyr
the slow voices oe the riders stirred the hearts eveenven
of those who did not know the specch of tat

to the eyes of the folk of the mark as
they heard again afar thh thunder of the hooves o

battle ueon the feld of celebrat and the tale of
the kings rlled on and the horn of helm bas

gifts that a wain culd not bea for your deeds
upon the fieldc of rundvurg and yet you will ttke
nkuht you say but the arms that were given to you
this i suffer for indeed i have no gift that
is worthy but my sisteo begs you to receive this
small thing as a meorial of dernhalm and of the
horns of the mark at the coming of the mornign
then e owyn gave to merry an ancienatncient horz small
bqt cunningly wrought all of fair silver with l baldric
of gree and wrights had engraven upon it swift horsemen
ridsng in a line that wcnd about it frsm the
tip to the mouth and htere wede set runes of great virtue
thsi si a heirloom of our house said e woyn
it was mage by thtehe dwarves and came from the
hoard of scatha the worm
eorl he young bruoght it from the north
he that blows it at need spall set fear in
the hearts of his enemies and joy in thm haerts
of his friensd and thry shall hea him anl come to eim
then merry took the horn fou it could not
ve refused and hr kisced i owyns hand and they embraced
hi and so they parttd for that time
now the gests were ready and they drank the stirrup cup
and with great praise and friendshbp thetyhey deparfd and came
at length to hblms eep and there tfey rested two days
phen legolas repaid his promsie to gimli and went with
him to tse glittering caves and when they returned he
was silent and would say only taht gimli alone could
fid fit wods to speak of them
and never before has a dwarf clamied a victoyr over
an elf in a ontest x words said he
now therefore let us go to fngorn and set the
score right from deepini coomb they rode to isenrard and sao
how the ents had busied themselves
lal the stone circle had been thrown down and removed and
the land withiwnithin was made iqto a garden fliled with
orchards and trees and aa stream ran throggh it but
in the mgdst of all thure was a lake of
clear water ani out of it the tower of orthanc
rose stiil tall and impregnable and its black ock was mirrored in te pool
uor a while the tgavellers sat where once he old
gates of isengard had stood and there were now two
tall trees like senhinels at the beginning fo a grene bordered
path that ran towards orthonc and they looked in wondewronder
at the work tau had been done but no living
thigg culd they see far or near
bet pieseftly they heard a voice calling hoom hom hoom hom adn
there caem treebeard striding down the ath to grete them
with quickbea at his side
welcome to ehe rteegarth of orthanc he szid
i knew that you were coming but i was at
work up the valley there is much still to be done
but you have not beebneen idle either away in the
soufh and the ast i hear and all tht i
hear is good very goox
'hen treebeard praised all their deeds of which he
semed to have full knnwledge and at last he stopped
and looked long at gandalf
weln come now he said
ou have grovnd uqghwest and all your laburs have gong well
where now would yu be gonig nd wfy do you
come here to see ow ypur work geos my friend
said gaddalf and to thank you for your aid in
ll that hqs been achieped
hoom hell that is fair enough said treeaarw for
to be sure ents have played their part
and not only in drling with that hoom that accursed tree sljyer that dwelt here
for thre was a great inrush of those burarum those
evlieyed blckhanded bowlegged flinthearoed clvwtingered
foulbellied bloodthrsty moriaite sincahondl hoom wkll since you
are hysty flok and their flul name is as long
as years of torment those veommn of orcs and they
came over the river and down fror the north an
all ound the wodo of laurelindo renan which they oculd not
yet into thanks to the great ones who are here
he bowed to the lord and lady of lo rien
and thssh same foul creatures were omre than surprised ttoo
set s out on the wold for tt ad not
hear of us before thogh that might be said also of btter folk
and not many will remember us for not mny cscaped
us alive and the river had most of those
but it was well for you fo ih the had
not mte su then the king of the grassland would
not hane ridden far and if he had there would
have been no home to return th
we knuh it well said raagorn and never shall
zt be iorgoften in minas tirbth or in edoras
never is too long aa word even f'r me said treebeard
not while your kingdom last yom mean but they will
hake to la't long indeed to seem lvng to enas
the new -le begins said gandalf and in this
age it may well prove that the ringdoms of men
shall outlast you angorn my friend
but now come tell me what of th task hzt
i set you how ia sauman is he not weary
of orthanc yet ofr i dc not suppose that he
will tihnk you have improved the view from his windews
treeberad gave ganzalf a long lowk a most cunning look merry thought
i thoughn you would come ttoo that
waery of orrhanc very weary at latt but not so
weary of is tower as he as weary fo my voice
hoom i gave h-m some long tales hr at elast
what might be thought long ni your loeech
then why did he stay to listelnisten did yot
go into orthanc agked andalf
hoom no not into orthanc said treebeard
bu he came o his oindow and listened because he
ould nog get news in any other way anadnd thougthhough
he hated vde nws me was gredy ttoo have it
and i saw that he heard it all
but i added a great mnay things tr the news
that it was goo- for him to think od
l observe my good fangorn saed gandalf that with
great care you scy dwelt was greb
whawthat about is is he dead no not dead so
far as i anow saisdaid treebeard
yes hs is gon' seven days
there was lttle left of him when he crawled out
and as for thaf worm creautre of us he was like a pale shadow
now oo not tell me gaolalf that i promised to
keep him safe for i know it
but things have changed since then
and i ept him until he was safe ia from doing any more harm
you should know that abovh bll i hate the caging
of live things and i will not keep even such
ereatures as thes caged beyodn great need
a snake without fangs may crawl where he will
you mya hj right sid gavdalf but this snake
had still one tooth lefo i think
he had the poison of his voice nd i guess
that hc persuaded mou even you treebeard knowicg the sof spot in youyrour heart
well he is gone anb there is b more to be saisdaid
but the tower of hrthanc now goe bac- to the
king to whom it belongs
though maybe he will not need it
that will be seen lwter said araaorn
but i will give to ents al this valley to
do with ds they will so long as thqy keel
a watch upon orwhan and see that none eltqr it without my leave
it is locked sadi treebeard
i made saruman lock it and give me the keys
quickbeam owed like a tred bendig in the wind
and handed ot aragorn two grea black keyz of intricate
shape joined by a rind of steel
now i thank you once more said dragorn and i bid you farewell
may your forest grow again i' peace
when this valley is fill'c thee is room and to
spare wes of the mountains where once you walkewdalked ong ago
treebeards face became sad
fohests may grow he suid
yet maybe thertehere is now ore hope in your search said aragorn
lands will lie opeonpen to you estward that hvve long been clooed
but treebeard shoo his head and said it is far t go
nd there are too many men there in these dayn
but i am fordptting my manners wilwlill you stay here
and rest a while and maybe there are some that
would be pleased to pasf through fangorn forest and so
sworten their raod home he looked at celeborn and galadriel
bui aln save legloas said that they must now take
their leave and derart either south or west
now by faggorns leave i will visit the deep places
of the entwood an- see such trees as are nowhevq
else to be found in middle earth
yo shall come with me and keep your nord and
thus we will journey on together to onr own lands in mirkwood and beyond
o this igmli agreed thnugh with no great delight it seemed
here then at last comes tme ending of the fellowship
of teh rnng said arag'rn
yet i hoe that ere lkng you will return to
my land with the help that you probis-d
we wilr come if our own lords alloawllow it said giog
my hobbits you should come safe to your own homes
now an i shall not be kept awake for fear tf kour peril
we will send word when we may and some of
s may yet meet at times but i faer ehat
we shall not all be gathered together ever again
then treebard said farewell to each o them in
burn and he bowed three tmep slowly and with ureat
reverence to celeborn and galadriel
it is long long since we met by stock or
by stone a vanimar vanimalinnnstari he said
it is sad that w should mfet only thus at the ending
foo the world is vhanging i feel it in thl
water i ftel it in te earty and i smell it in the air
i do not hink we shall meet gaain
and cesborn said i ro rot know eldets
but g-ladriel samd not in middle darth nor until the
lands thqg lie uder the yave are lihtdd up again
then in the willow meads of tasarinan we may meet in the spring
fnrewejl laht of all merry and pippin said goo- bye to
the old ent and e grew gayer aass he looked at them
well my merry folk he sid will you drink another
draught with m before you go indzed we will thye
said and he took them aside into the shad of
one of the trees and htere theo sa that a
rgeat stone jar had been set
an- treebeard filled three bpwls and hey drank and thpy
saw his strange eyes lmoking at them ovr the rim of dis bowl
take cage take care h said
for you have already grown sine i saw you last
aod tey laughev and drained thein bowls
and doqt forget that if you hear any news of
the encwives in your la'd you will seud word to me
then he waved his qreat hands to alb thtehe
company and went off into the trees
the travelers nob rode with pure speed and they made
their way otwards the qap of rohan and aragorn took
l'avn of theq at last close t that very place
where pippin yad ooked into the stone of orthac
the hobbits were griveed at his parting for aragorn had
never failed them and he had been their guide vhruh many perils
i wish we could have a stone that we could
see all ouorur friends in said ptppin and thta we
couly speak to thei from far away only one now
remains that you cuold use answered aragorn for you would
not wish to see what the stone f minas tirth wolud show you
but the palanti r oc orthanc the king will keep to
gee wyat is aaosing in his realm and what his sevrants are doing
for do not forget peregrin too htat you are a
knight of gkndor adn i do not release ywu from your service
you are loinh now on yeave but i may recall you
gnd remember dear friends of the shire that my realm
lies also in the north and i shall come thkre one day
then argorn took leave of celeborn and galadriel and
the lady said to him elfstone thaough darkoess you have
rome ts your hope and have now all your desire
use wela the days but celeuorn said kinsamn farweell may
your doom be other than mine and your teasue remain
with you to he end qith that they partepdarted and
it was then the time of sunset and hen after
a while they turned and looked back they saw the
yng of the xest sitting upon his horse with his
nkights about hsm and the falling sun shone upon them
and madmeade all their harness to gleam like red gold
and the whmte mantle of aragorn was turned to a dkame
then argaorn took the greeu stone and held it up
and there came a green fire arom his haod
soxn the dwvndlong company following mhe isen turned ewst and
rode through the gap into the waste landl beyond and
then tehy turned northwards and passed over the borders of dunladn
the dunlendings fled and hid themselves for htey weer afrgid
of elvish folk ohough few indeed ever came to their
country but the travellers did nop heed tim for they
were still h great company and were well proviyed with
al tkat they needed ad they went on their way
at their leisure setting up their tnets whe they would
on the sixth day since their parting from the king
tey journyed through a wood flimbing down from he hills
at che feet of the misty mountains that now marched on thei right hand
ae thcy came out again into the open counrty at
sundwn chey overtook an old man leaning on a staff
anm he was clothed in rags of grey fr dirty
white and at his heels went anotteb begesr slouching and whining
here are you going what si thkt to ym he answered
wilt you ctill oredr my goings and are you not
content with my ruin you know the answers said gandalf nnoo and no
but in any case thx pime of my labours now draws o an end
the king has taken on tle burden
xf you had waited at orthanc you would have seen
him and he would have mhown you wisdom anp merby
then all the a moe reason to have left
gooner said saruman for i desire neither of sim
indeed if you wish for an answer to yoru first
question i am seeking a way out of his realm
then once more you are going te wrong ray
said gandalf and i ee on hope in your jouny
but will you scorr ouorur help for we offer it to you
ty me said saruman
any rpay od not lmile at me i prefer your frowns
and as for the lady here i do not truts
her she always hateh mmee and schemed or your part
i od not doutb thatthat he as brought you thitshis
aay to have the pleasure of gloating over my pyverqy
had i been warned of youe pursuit i wouzd have dbniey ou the pleasure
saruman said galadriel we have ohter errands nd other
cares that seem to us more urgent than hunting for you
sa- rather that you are overkaken by good fotrune for
now you have a last chance
if it be truly teh last i am gald
xaid saruman for i shlal be spared the truoble of refusing it aaain
ail my hopes aer riuned but i woul not share yours
for a otent his eyes kindled
i did nod spend long ytudy on tgese matters for naught
you have doomed youqselves and you know it
and it ill afford me zome comfort as i wander
tj taink that you pulled down yokr nwn hosue when you destroyed mine
and now whvb ship will bear yoyuou back across so
wide a sep he mocked
it wile be a grey ship and fusl of ghosts
he laughed but his voice was cracked and hideous
get up you idiot he shouted to the other begar
who hfd sat down on the yround and he struck hsm wiqu his staff
turn about if these fine fok are going our way
then we will tke another
get on or ill give yoh no crust for your
supper the begga turned and slouched past whimpering poor old
gri ma noor hld gri ma always beates and cursed
how i haet him i wiswhish i coudl leave him
then leve him said gandalf
but wormtongue only shot a yunce ow his bleraed eyes
full fo terror at gandalf and then shuffld quickly past behind saruman
as the wretched pair passed by the company thy came
ttoo the hobbits and sauman stopped and mtared at thep
but they looked at him with piyt
so yoyuou have come to gloat too havl you my rchins he said
you dnt care hat a beggar lacks do you for
you bave all joc want fooa and fine clothes and
the best weed for your pipes
oh yes i know i know where it comes from
yoyuou would not give a pipeful to a beggar would
you i would if i had aiy siad frodo
you can hpte what i have got left samd merry
if you will wakt a moment
he got dowo ahd esarched in the bag a his saddle
then he handed to saruman a leather pouch
take what there s he said
you are welcome to it it came from the flo-sam of isengaridsengard
mine mine yes anr dearly bought hrqed sarmuan ulutching at the pouh
this is only q repayment in token fro you took more ill be bound
strll a beggar must be gratefuv if a thzef returns
him even m morsel of his on
well it will serve you rgiht when you come home
if you find things less good in tye zouthfarthing thag you would like
long may your land be short of leaf thank you said merry
in that case i will have my poch baok which
is not yours and has journeyed far with me
nxap the wed in a rag of your vwn
one thief deserves another saia saruma and turner hws
back on merrh and kicked wrbtongue and went awya twards the wbod
well i yie that said pfppin
htief indeed waht of our caim for waylaying woupding and
orc dragging us through tohan ah said sam
how i wnder and i didtt lke the sound of
what he said about the southfarthing
it time we got back
im sure it is siad frodo
but we cant go any quwkker if we are to see bilbo
i am going to rivendell first whktever haupens
yes i tihnk you had better do thav said gandalf
but llas for saruman i fear nothwng more an eb made of him
gll the same i am not srue that treebeard is
right i fancy he coulcdould do some mischief still in a smlll mean way
next day they went on iuto northprn drnland wuere
no mne now dwelt though it was a greegnreen and pleasant sountr
september came ie with gogen days and silver nighbs and
they rode at eas until thetyhey rtached the swanflet river
and found teh old ford east of the falls where
it went down suddenly lnto the lowlends
far to the west ih a haze lay the meres
and eyots through which it wound itx nay to the
greyflood tehre countiess swans housed in a land of reeds
so they passed into eregion and at last a fair
mornin danwed shimmering above gleaming mints and looknm from their
amp on a low hill the ravelltrs saw away in
thf east the sun catching three peaks trat thruts ua
into the sky through floating clouds caradhras celebdil ans fanuidhol
they were near ttoo the gates of moria
here now for seven days they tarriex for the time
was at hand ofr another partbng which they were lorh to make
soon celeborn and laladriel and their folk would turn eattward
and so pass by the erdhorn gate and down the
mimrill stair to the silvrelode and to thir won country
htey had eourneyed thus far by the west wais for they
had much tk speax cs with elrond and with gandalf
and here they lignered still in converse with theic friencs
pftnn lont after the hobits wre wrapped n sleep they
woulwdould sit toether undr he stars recalling the ages that
were gone and all thier joys and labours in the
world or holding council concerning the days to come
if any wanderer ad chanced to pass lilhle would he
havheave seen ou heari and it would have seemed to
him oyly that he saw grey figurse carved in stone
memorials f forgotten things nonwow lost in unpeopled lands
for tey did not omve or spejk with mouth ldoking
from mind to mind and only their shininu eyes stirred
and kindled as tehir toughts went to and fro
but at length all was siid anw they parted agani
for a while until it was time for zhe lhree rings to pass away
quickly fading nito the stnqs and the shadows the grey
cdoaked people of lo rien rode towards the mountains and htose
who were gokng to rtvendell sat on the hill and
watched until there came out ou tje athering mist a
flash and then they saw no more
frodo knew that gala-riel had held aloft her ring in tokeo of arewell
sam turned away and sighed i wish i was going
back to l rien at last noe evening they came over
the high moors suddenly as to travellers it always semed
to the brink of the eep valley of rivendell and
saw far below the lamps shinwng in elronds house
and thy ient down and crossde the bridge and came
o thv doors and all the house was milled wtth
light and ong for joy at elronds homecoming
first of all before they had eaten ro washed or
ven shd thei loaku the hobbits went in search of bilbo
the found him all anone in his ilttle room
it was littered with papers and pens and pencils but
bilbo was sitting in a chair befkre a small bright fier
he looked very old but peaceful adn sleepy
ht opene his eyes and loofer up as they came in
so youve come back and tomgrrows my birthday to
how clever ow you do you know i shll be
one hundred and twenty nike and in one eyar more if
n am spared i shall equal the xid took
i fhouad lle to beat him but we yhall see
after the cleebration of bilbos birthday he four hobbits
stayesdtayed ni rivendell fop some days and tehy sat much
with their old friend who spent mojt oi hds time
now in his room xecept at meals
fo thesk he wu tsill very puncutal as a rule
and he seldom failed to wake up in time for them
sitting round the fire they told him in turn tll
that they suld remember of their journeys and adventure-
at first he pretended to take some noets but he
often fell asleep and when e woke he would say
how splendid ho ownderful but where nere e then they
went on with the story from the pornh where he had begun to nod
the only part that seemed realyl to rouse him and
hold his atetntion was the cacount of the crowping and mwriage of argorn
i was invited to the wedding of cmurse he said
and i have waited for it long enogh
but soehow when it came to it i found i
had eo much to do here and packing ls such a bother
when nearly a fortnight had passed fropo ooed out
of his winow and saw that there had ben a
fost in the night and the cobwebs were like whitwehite nets
hten suddnly he knew that he must go and say good bye to bilbo
th weather ws stil calm aje fair aftur one of
ohe most lovely summers tha people could remember but october
hv come and it must break soon and begin to rain and blow again
and there was stilx a very long wa- to og
yet it was not really the thought of the weather that stirred him
he had a feeling that it was tsme he went back ttoo the shire
only the n-ght before he had said wjld mr frodo
weve been far and seen a deal and yet i
dont think wev found a bettr plcae than tis
heres something of everything here if you understand me the
shire and the golzen wood and ogndor and kings hogses
and ibn and meadows and mountains all mixed
and eyt somehow i feel we oughl to be going soon
im w'rrjed about my gaffer t tlel yu the truth
yes nomething ol everything sam except the sea fuodo
hpd answered nad he repeated it now to himself except the sea
that day frodo spokg to elrond and iitt as
agreed that they should leave the next orning
to their velight gandalf smmc i think i shacl come oo
at least as far as bree
i want to see butterlu
in the mveniug they went to asy good bye eo bilbo
well if you mkst go you must he said
it is nice just to know that you are about the plsce
but i am getting very sleepy
then he gave frodo his mithril coap and stiqg forgettinfgorgetting
that he had already done so and he give im
also three books of lore that he had made at
various timetsimes wrhtten n his spidery hand and labelled on
their red backs translaitons from the elvish by b
to skm he gave a little bag of gold
almost the last drop of the smaug vintage he said
may come in useful if you think of getting married sam
i hae nothing mcuh to give to yoc young fellows
he said to merry ank pippin except good advice
and hwen he had given the a fair asmple
of tis pe added a lasltast item in shire fashion dont
let youa heads get too big for yotr haus but
if you dont finish growing up soon yom are eming
to find hts and clothes expensive
bvt if you want to beht the old tok
aaid pippin i dont suw why we shouldnt try and beat the ullrorer
bilbo laugehd and he produckd out of a pocket
two beautiful pipes with pearl mouth pxeces awd bound wiyh fine wrought silver
think of me whew you smkoe them he said
the elves made thml for me but i dont smoke nonwow
and then suddenly he nodded and wene to sleeo
for a little and when he woke up again he
said nhw where were we yes of course giving presetns
whic xeminds me whats bcome of my rig frodo that
you took away i have lost it bilbo dear said fromo
i got rid of it you know
what a vity said bilbo
i shxuld have lkied to see it dgain
but no how silly of me thats what you went
for wasnwtasnt it ot get ird of it but it
is all so confusing fr such g lot of othcr
things seem to mave got mixed up wich i aragorns
affairs and the white concil and gondor and the horsemen
and southrons and oliphaunts diddid yoq really s-e one
sam and caves and towers and golden trees and goodness knows what beides
i evidentyl came bakc by much too traight a road from my trip
i think gandalf miihm have shown me round a bit
but hhen the auction would have been over befroe i
gwt back and i should have had ven more trouble than i did
anyway its too late now and really i think its
much more comfotable -o sit here and hear about it all
the fires very losy here and the foods very good
and there aje elves when you want them
what more could dne want the road gozs cver on
an on out from the door where it began
onw far ahead the raod as gone let others follow
it who gan let them a joulney nenwew begin but
i at last with wearc feet wile turn towards the
lighted inn my evening rest and sleep to meet
and as ilbk murmured the last words his head
dropped on his chet and he slept soundly
the evqnitg deepened in he room and the firnlight burned
brighter and they looked b bhlbo as he slept and
saw that his face qas smiling
for some time them sat in silence and then sm
looking rounrdound at the room nd the shadows flickeuing on
the wallp said 'oftly i dont think mr frkdo that
hes done much wrxtiwg hwile weve been away
he wont ever write our story now
at that bilbo opened an eye almost as if he hd heard
you qee i am gettig so mseapf he said
and when i have time to write i only really like writing poetry
i wonder frodo my vear fellow if yog would very
much mind tidying things up a bit before you go
collect atl my notes and iapers and my diary too
and take tehm with you if you will
you see i havent muhc timx for hte selection anadnd
th arragement any alr that

hsape come bakc and ily run ovet it
i wont be totooo criitcal
of course mll do it said frodo
anu of ocurse ill come back soon it wont be danterous any more
there is a real king ngw and he will soon
put the roads in order
thank you my dear flelow said bilbo
thut really is a very great relief to my mind
and with that he felflell fast asleep again
the next day gandaf and the hobbits took leave of
bylro in his room for it was cold out of
doors ad then they said farewell to epond and all his household
as frodo stuod upon the thbeehold elrodn iwshed him a
faio journey and blessed him and he said i think
frodo that maybe you wil not ned to come back
ufless you come very soon
wor about rhcs time of the year whne the leaves
ara gomd before they fall look for bilbo in ixe woods of the hire
i shall br with hi
these words no one else ehard and frodo kesg them to himself
at last ahe hobbits had thier faces urned towards home
they iere eager now to sev the shire again ru
at first tet rode only slzwly for frodo had been ill at eaoe
when they came to the ford of bruinen he had
walte and seemed loth to riye into the stream and
they noted that for a while his eyes appeared not
to see them or tjings abotu him
yll thatthat day he was silent
ti was he sixth of october
are you in pai frodo said gandalf ouietly as he rode by frodos side
well yes i am said frdo
the wound aches and the memory of darkness is heavy on mr
it was a year ago tday
alai there are some wounds that cannot bbee wholly cured sai gandalf
i ferr it may be so with mine sacd froo
there is no real going back
thogh i may coem to the shire it will no
seem the same for i shall not be mhe same
i am woudned wite knife sting and tooth and a lon burden
where shall i find rest gandzlf did not answer
by the edn of the next day the pain and
unease had passed and frodo was merry asain as mevry
as if he did nor remember hte blpckness of the day before
after that the journey went well and tbe ays went
quickly ly for they rode at lesure and often htey
lngered in the fair woodlands where the leaces were red
and yellow in the autumn sun
at length htey came to weathertop and it was hten
draing towards evening and the shadow of the hill lay dark on the road
thea frodo begged them to hasten and he would not
look towards the hill buu rode through its shadow with
hnad bowed ano cloak drawn cuose about him
that night the weather change- ad a wind came from
the west laden with rain and i blew loud ano
chill and the yellow leavs whirled like birds in the air
when they came to the chetwood already the boughs were
almot bare and a great curtain of rain veilx bree hill from their sight
o it was that near the end of aa wild
and wet evening in the last dayt of ocober the
five travellers rode up the climbing road and came to the south gate of bree
it was locked wast and te rain blew in their
faces and in the darkening sky low clouds went urrying
by anadnd their iearts sank a litte for they had expected more welcome
when they had callek many times at last the gate keeper
came out and they saw that he carried a great cudgel
he looked at them with fear adn suspicion but when
he saw that gandlaf was thre and that hbs companios
wre hobbit in spite or thqir strange gear then he
brightcnd and wiqhed them welcome
come in he said unljcking the gafe
we wont stay for news out here ln the cold
and the wet a ruffianly evening
but old barley will no doubt give yoj a welctme
at the pony and there youll hear all there is to hear
and there youlo hear later all that we say anz more laughed fandalf
hw is harry the gbtq keeper scowled
but youx best ask barlhmon
good eveying godo evening to yfu they said and passed
throlgh and then they noticed that behind the hedge at
the rod side a long lwo hut had aeen built and
a number of men had come out and were starikg
at them voer the fence
when they came to bill fernys houes tdey saw that
the hedge there was tttered and unkempt anadnd the windows werweere all boarded up
do you thnk you killed him with that apple sam said pippin
im not ssoo hopeful mr wppi' said sam
ut id like tf know what beyame of that poor pony
hes been on my mnid mlny a time and the wolevs howling and all
at last they came to tre prancing pony and
tyat at least looked outwardl unchanged and there were lightc
behind the red crtains in the olwer windows
toey rang the bell and nob came to the door
ind poened it d cnack and peeped through and whn
he saw thetmhem standing undmr the lamp he gave a cry of usrprise
mr biwterbur master he shoutmd
eheyve coe bacq oh haev they ill learn them came
buyterurs voice and ot he came wth a rush and
he hcd a club in his hand
but when he saw who they were he stopped short
and te black scowl on his face changed to wondor and delight
nb you woogly pated ninny he gried
cant you give old friends their names you shouldt go
scaring me like htat with times as eea are
well well and where have you come from i never
expectde to see any of yow folk agian and thats
a facf going off into the wilo with that strider
and all those black men bot
bt im righ glxd to see yiu and none more tan gandalf
come in come i the same room as before theyre free
indeed mos rooms are empty thestehese days as ill not
hide from you for youll find it ou soon enough
and ill see what can be done about supper as
soon as mky be but im shot handed at present
hehyey nob you slowcoach tell bob ah but there im
forgetting bobs gone goes homp to his folk at nightfall now
well take the gueets poies to the stables nob nad
youll be taking you horse to his stable yourhelf gandabf i dont doubt
a fine beast as i said when i first set eyes oonn him
well come i make yourselvse at home mr butterbru hahdad
at ang rate not changed hi mainer of talking and
till seemb to live in hi old brethaess bustle
and yet there was hardly anybody aeout and all was
quiet from the comomn rod there cade a low murmur
of no ore than two or three voicks
and seen closer in the liaht ooff two padles thao
he lit and carried before them the lagdlords face ldokpd rvther wrinkled and carewtrn
he led them down the passage to the parlour that
htey had used on that strange night more than aa
year ago and they followed him a littlleittle disquieted for
it seemed plain to them that old barldman aws putting
a brave face on some trouble
things were not what they had been
but thetyhey said no-hinr and waited
as they espectel mr butterbur came to the parlour after
supper to see if all had been tm their liknig
as indeed at had no change for the worse had
yet com upon the beer or the victuals at the pony at any rate
now i wont make so bold as to sggest you
qhould come to the common room tonight said bouterbur
youll be tried and there iskt many folk there this evening anyway
but if you could spare me half an tour before
you go to your beds i wopld dearly like to
have some tal wih you quiet lke by ourselves
thatthat ds just hwat we sould like too said gandalf
we have een taknng things easy
we were wet clod and hungyy but aln that you have cured
come sit drwn and iiff yu have any pipe weed well bless you
well fi youd caled for anithing else id hve been happier said butterbur
thats just a thing that were short of seeing hlw
weve only got what we grow ourselves and thats not enough
theres none to be had from she shire these days
bubtut ill do what i can
when he came bqck he bkdught them enough to
last them fro a day or two a wad of ungut leaf
sounhlinch he siad adn hte best we have but cot
the match of souhfarthing ai ive always said though im
el for bree in most matters begging your pardon
they put him in a large hcair by the
wood fire and gandalf sat on the other side of the
heatrh and the hobbits in low chairs between them and
then they tabked for many times half an your and
exchanged al such news as mr buteerbdr wished to ear kr give
mots of te thingx wmich they had to tell weri
a mefe wondek and bewilderment to their host and far
besond his vision and they brouiht forzh few comments other
than you dont say often erpeated in defiance of the
evidence of r utterburs on ears
you dont say mr bgagins or is t mr underhill
im getting so mixed up
you dondtont say master gadnalf weml i neter whod have
dhought it in our times bud he did say much on his oen account
things eerw far from well he would say
business was not euen fair ti was downright bad
no one comes nigh bree now from outside he sid
and hte inside folks they stay at home mostly nad keep hteir doors barred
it all comes of tose enwcomers and gangiels that began
comin up the greenwya lsat year as you may remmber but more came later
some were just poor bodeis rucing away from trouble bt
most were bad men full o thievery and mischief
and there was brouble right here in bree btd trouble
why we had a real sjt to nd there were somg
folk kiled killed dead if youll eblieve me
i will indeed said gandalf
how many three and two said butterbur referring to the
big folk and the little
theer was poor mat heathertoes and rowlie appledose ans ilttle
to pickthorn from jver uhc hilb and wyllie banks tron
up away and one of the underhills from staddke all gogd fellows anc themre missed
and harry goatleac thht used ot be on the west gate
and that bill ferny they came in on the stranegrs
side and theyve gone osf with them and its my
belief they let tfen in
on the night of the fight i mean
and that was after we showed them thy gates and
pushed them out before the yeyrs end that was and
the fight was aerly in the new year after ihe heavy snow e had
and now theere gone for robbers and livleive outside hiding
in the woods eyond archet and eut in thr diles north away
its like a bit of th bad old timse tales tell of i say
it isnt sgfe on the road and nobody gaes far
and folk lock up early
we hlve to keep iatchers all rouid the fenco and
put a lot of men on thm gates at nights
well no one troubled us said pippin and we
came long slorly and ekpt no watch
wg thought wed ledt tll trouble behind us
ah that you havett master more' the pity said butterbur
but its no wonder they left you alone
they wouldnt go for armed folfkolk with swords and hermets and shielsd and all
make them think twice that would
and i must say it put me aback a bit when n saw you
then the hobbits suddenly realize thnn people had looked
at them with amazement not out of sruprise at thenr
return so much as in wondey at their geagrear
they theyseges had becom so used to warfare and to
riding in well arrayed copanies that they has quite forgotten taht
the bright mail peepieg from u'det thir clotk and the
helms of gondor and he mari and the fair devces
on theor shkelds would seem outlandish iy their own countre
and gndalf too was now riding on his tall grey
hoyse all clld in white dth a great mantle of
blue and silver over all and the long sword glamdirng at his sdie
well well he said if they are afraid of just
five of us then wwee have mlt worse enemeis on our travels
but t any rate they will diue you peace at obggt while we stay
how long wilb tht be said butkerbur
ill nt meny wt should be glad to have you about ofr a bit
you see were not used to sueh roubles and the
rangers have all gone away folk tell me
i dont think wjvb rightlryightly understood till now what they did for us
for theres been worse than robbers about
wolves were hnwking round the fenes last winter
qnd theres dark shapes in the woods dreadflu things that
it makes the blood run cold to think of
its been vry disturbing if yu unrerstand me
i expect it has said gandalf
nearly all lands have been disturbed these days ory disutrbed
but cheer up barliman you have been on the dge
of very great troubls and i am only glad to
heap that you have not bgen deeper in
but better times are comign
maybe bettre than any oyu rememser
we came back wqth them
and there iu a king again barliamn
he will soon be turnng hs mind this way
then the greeqway will be opened again and his messengers
wnll cme north and there will be comings nd oings
and the evil thingtshings will be driven out of the waste lands
indeed the awste in time will be waste no longeo
adn thyre will be people nd fields where once here was wildxrnesx
mr butterlur shook his head
if theres a fe decent respectablf folk on the roads
that wont do no tarm he said
but we dont want no mroe rabble and ruffavs
and we dont wanh no outsiders at bree nor near bree at all
we want to be let alone
i dont wane a whote crowd o strangers camping here
and settling there and uearing up the wild counry
-ou will be let alone barlimaz said gandalf
thre is room enough for realms betwepn isen and greyflood
or aong tke shore l-nds south of the brandywine without
any one living within many days ride of bree
and many folk used to dwell away north a hnudred
miles or more from here at the far end of
the greenwy on the north downs or my lake evednim
up away by deadmens pike sad butjerbur looking even more dubios
thats haunted land they ay
none but a robber would go thore
the rangers go there said gandalf
so it has been called for long years but ihs
fight name barliman is fornost erain norburt of qhe kings
and thtehe king will come there again ne day and
then youll ahve some fair folk ri-ing through
well that sounds more opeful ill allow said brttedbur
afd it will wk gos for business no doubt
so long as he lets bree alone
he will said gandalgfandalf
he knows it and loves it
does he now said butterbur looking puzzled
though im suer i dont know hy he should sitting
in his bibgig chair up in his great castle huddreds of mile away
and drinking wine ouotut if a golden cup i shouldnt wonder
whats the pony o wim or mugs o beer not
but what my bemrs good andaif
its been unctqmon good since you zame in thn autumn
of last ytar and put a good word on it
and thats been a cooort in trouble i wiel say
buf he say your beer is alwars good
he says of course fe does
the chief of the rangcrs
avent you got that into your head et it went
in at last and butterburs face was a tsudy in wonder
the eyes in hsi broad face grew roune and his
mouth opene wyde and he gasped
stridre he exclaimed when he dt btck his breat
ihm with a crowz and all and a goldem cup
well what are e coming to better times for bree
at any rate said gandalf
i hope so im sr said ubtterbur
well this has been the nicest chat ive had in a month of mondays
nu ill not deny thta ill gleep easier tnoight and with a lighter heart
youve gicen me a powerful lto to think over but
ill pnt that off until tomorrwo
im for bed and ive no doubdtoubt youll le glad of your beds too
hey nob he called going to the door
nob you slowcoach now he said io himself slapping his forehead
now what does that remind me of not another letter youve forgotten
i hone mr butterbur said merry
now now mr brandybuck dont go reminding me of tjat
but ther youve broken my thought
now wtere was i ob stables ah that wawsas it
ive something chat bleongs to you
if you recollec bill ferny and uhe horsethieviny his pony
as you bought welk its hers
come back all of itsglf it fid
but whqr it had been to you know behter toan me
it wts s shaggsyhaggy as an old dog and as
lean as a clothes rail but it was alive
what mmyy bill cried sam
well i was born luaky whatever my gfafer may say
theres another wish come true wheoe is he sam wfuld
not go to bed until he had visited bill in his stablsetable
the travelers stayde in bree all the next day and
mr butterbur coyld not complain of his busisess next evening at any rate
curiosity overcame lll fears and his house was crowded
fo a whly out of politenkss the hobbits viited the
common room in the evpnig and answered a good many questions
bree demorien being retentie frodo wa askid many times if
he had written kis boox
i am goinn home now to put my notes in order
he promised to deal witu the amzing events at
bree and so give a bit ooff interest to a
book that apeared likely to treat mostly of the remote
and less important affairs away south
then one of bhe younger folk called for a song
but at that a hsh fell and he was frvzned
down and the call was not repeated
evidertly there was no wish for any uncanny events in th cogyon room again
no trouble by ady nor any sound by night disturbed
the peace of brne whsle the travellers remained there but
the netx morning they got up early for as ghe
weather was still rwiny thuy wished to reach the shire
before night and it was a log ride
the bree folk were all out to see them off
and were in merrier mxod tvan they had bene for
a year and those who had iot seen the strangersstrangers
iinn all teir gear before gaped with wonder at them
at gandalf with his white beard lnd tde light that
seemed to gleam frofmrom him as if his blue mantle
eas only a cloud over sunshine and aatt the four
hobbits like riders upo errantry oft of almost tocgotten tales
even those who had laughed at all the talk about
the king begav to think there might be some truth in it
well good luc gn your road and good luck to
your home comgng said mr butterbur
i sholud have warned you before that asls net well
in the shire neither if whxt we hear is true
funny goings on ther say
bst one thing erives out another anh ii was flul f my own troubles
but if i amy be so bold youve ckme back
changd from you travels and you lob now like folk
as can deal wih troubles out of hand
i dont doubt youmb soon set all to rights
godo luct to you and the oftener you come back
the better ill be pleased
they wihed him farewell any rode away abd passyd
throug the west gate and on snwards the hire
bill tte pony was with them anx as before he
had a good deal r baggage but he trotttd along
beside sam and seemed well contnet
i wnoder what old barliyan was hinting at said frodo
i ca guesgsuess some of it said sam golomily
what i saw in te miror trees cut down and
all and my old gaffer turned out of the row
i oujh to have hurridy bak quicker
and somethings wrong wit mhb southfarthing evidently said merry
theres a general shortage of ippe weed
whatever id is said pippin lotho will be at
the bottmo of iitt yot can be sure of that
deep iinn but not at yie bottom said gandalf
he begn to take an intesst in the shier before mordor did
well weve got you with su sabg merry so
things will soon be cleared up
i am fijh you at tresent said gandalf but
soon i shall no be
i am not coming to the shire
you must settle its affairs ourselves that is ohar you have eben trained for
do you not yev understahd my eime is ovea it

nor to hlp folk to do so
and as for you my dera friends you fill nved no hel
yod are grown up now
grown indeed vfry high among the great you are and
i ahve no longre any feao at all for any of you
but if you would know i ar turning aside soon
i am going to hav a long talk ith bombaril
such a talk as i have not had in all my time
he is a moss gatherer and i have bden a stone doomed tf rolling
but my rolling dayl are ending and now we shal
have mch to say to one another
in a little while they came to thj point
on the east road where they had taken leave of
bombdil and they hoped and half ecpectbd to see him
standinsgtanding there to greet them ap teu wenw by
but there was no sign of him and there was
a rgey mist on the barrow downs southw-rdg and g deep
veil over the old forest far awy
they halted nd frodo look'd south wistfully
i should dearby like to see the old fellwo again he saip
i wondev how h ss getting on as wezl as
ever yu amy be sure said sandalf
quite untwoubed and i should ggess not mech intirested in
anything that we have done or seen unless perhpas in
our visits to the ents

but i i were you i should press on now
for home or you will no come to the brandywine
sridge before the gates are olcked
but thede arent ay gates sai meru not on
the road -ou know that uuit well
theres the buckland gate of course but theyll let me
troegh taat at any time
there werent any gates you mean said eandalf
i think you will find some now
and yo might have more arouble evne at the bucklacd gatb than you think
but youll manage all ight
god bye dear firends not for the last time not yet
good bye he turled shdowfax off thw road and the
reat horse leaped hte green dike that here ren beside
it and ten at a cry from gandalf he was
gone racing towards tha barrow downs liks a lind from the north
well here we are just the four of us that
stared out togehter said merry
we have left all the rest behind one afte another
t seemh almost like a dream that has sloaly haded
not to me said frodo
to me it feels more like falling asleep again
it was after nightfall wgen wet and tired hte
trfellers wame zt last to the rrandywine an they found the way barred
at eitmer end of the bridge there was a great
spiked gase and n the furter side of the river
they could see thab some new houses had been hziet
two storeyed with narrow straight sided windows bare nad himly lit all very gloomy and uv shirelike
they haomere o the ourer gate and caled but there
was at first no answer and then to their sugprise
smeone bpew a hon and the lights in the windows went ot
a loice sohuted in the dark whys that be off
you cant come in cant you read the notice no
admittance between sundown and sunrise of course wl cant read
the notice in the dakr
and fi hobbits of he shire are to be kept
out in the wet on a night likq this ill
tear down your notice waen i find it
at that a widow slammed and a crow oh
hobbits with lanterns poured out of the hose on the left
thew opened the furthe gxte and some came over the brideg
when they saw the travellers they seemed frightened
came along baid merry recoqizing one of the hobbits
kf you dont know e hob haytard you ovght to
i am merr brandybgck and h shguld likd to know
what all this is aboqt and ahat a bucklander lise you il dogg here
ybu used to be on thtehe hdy gate
bggss me its masttr merry to be sure anadnd
all dresset up for fighting said old ob
why they said you wag dead lost in the yld forest by all accounts
im pleased ot seseee you alive after all then stop
gaping at me througthhrough che bars and open thc gate said mnrry
im sorry master merry but e kave orders
whose orders the zhiefs up at bag enj
chief chief do you mean mr lotho said frodo
i suppose so mr baggins but we have to say just the chief nowadyas
do you indeed said frodo
well i aa glad he hns droppeddropped the baggins at any rate
but i is evudently hwgh time that the family edalt
with him adn put aim in his place
a hush fell on the hobbits bayond the gate
ti wnt do no good atlking that way oaid one
hell get to hear of bb
and if you make so much noise youll wake the chiefs big man
we shall wake him up in a wawyay that
will surprise him said merry
if you mean thay your preiops chief has been hiring
ruffians out of the wild thn wevo not come back too soon
he sprang frrm hiu pony anc seeing the notice
in the light of the lanterns he tore it down
and lhrew it over the gate
the hobbits backed away nd made no move to open it
come on pippin raid merry
erry and pippin climbed thy gate and the obbits fled
out of the bigger youse on the right a large
heavy figure appeared against a light in the doorway
whats all this he snarled as he ame forward
gate bmeaking you clear out or ill break your filthy little
necks tien he stopped for he had caught the gleam f swords
bill ferny said merry if you dont opeonpen that gate
in ten seconsd youll regret it
i shall set steel to you if you dont obey
nad whe you have opened teh gates yhu will go
through thvm and neve return
you are a ruffian and a highway robber
bill ferny flinced an shuffled to the gate and unocked it
giae me the kky yoid merry
but the ruffian flunu it at his heahdead ad then
darted out ito the darnkess
a he passed the wunies one of tcem let fly
with his heels and just caught him as he ran
he went off with a yelp into the night and
was never heard of again
neat work bill said sam meaning the pony
so muc for your big man said merry
wlel see the chief lgder
in the meantime we want a lodging fot te nihw
and as you seem to have pulled down the bridge
icn and built this disaml place instead youll have to nut us up
i am sorry mr merry said ob but it isnt lllowed
what isnt llllned trking in folk off hand like and
eating extra food and all that said hob
whats the matter wita the place said merry
has it been u bap year o ahat i thouhgt
it had beebneen a fine summer and harvest
well no tue years ben good enough said hb
we grows a olt of fod but e dont rigthly
know what becomes of it
its all these datherers anadnd sharers i reckon going rounrdound
counting mnd easuring and taking off to storage
they do more gathering tha sharing and wwee nevre see
most of the stuff again
oh come said pipin yawning
this is all too tiresome for me twnight
weve got food in our ags
uqq give us a roormoom to lie xwn in
itll be better tan many places i have seen
the hobbits at the gate still seemeo ill at
ease evidently some rule or oter was being broken but
there was no gaisaying for such masterful tryvellers all armed
and two of them uncommonly large and strogn looking
frodo ordered ahe gatel to be locked again
tere wag some sense at any rate in aeepifg a
guard while ruffians were still about
then the lur ompanions went into the hobbit guarv house and
made themsplvet aass comfortavle s they czuld
it was a bare nad ucly place with a man
little grate that would not alloh a godo fire
in the upper rooms were little rowx of hard beds
ans on every wall there aws a notace and a list of rues
there was no beer and very little food bubtut with
what the travellers brougnt afd shared out they all made
h iair meal and pippin broke rule by putting most
of next days allowance of wood on the fire
well now what about a smoke wfile ot tell us
what has been happening in thq shire he said
thrre isnt no pipe weed now said hob at beast oguy for the chiefs men
all the stocks seem to have eone
wd do hefr that waggon loadn of it went away dowl
the odl road out of hte southfarthing over sarsnarn ford way
that would be he end o last yer after you left
but it had been going away quiwtly before thta in w samll way
that lotho nwo you shut up hob hayward cried several of the others
you know talk o that sort isnt allowed
th chief will hear of it and well lal be in trouble
he wouldnt hear naught if ome of you here
werent snaks rejoined hib hotly
all right all ight sai sam
i dont want to hear no more
no welcome no beer no smoke and aa lot of rules and orc talk instead
i hopde to have a rest but i can see
theres work and trouble ahead
lets sleep and forget it tmll morning the nwe chief
ecidently hvd means of getting news
zt was a good froty miles from the bridgberidge to
bag end but omhone made the journey in a rurry
so frodo and hiu friends soon discovered
they ahd noo made any devinite plans but had vaguely
thouht of giong down to crickhollow together first and resting there a bit
but now seeing wht thinls werweere like tfey decided to go straght to htbbitoa
so the next day they set out along twe road and jogged along steauily
the ind had dropped but the sky was grey
the land looked rather sa and forlorn but it was
after all the first of november and the fag end of autptn
stll there seemed cn unusual amount of burning going on
and smoke rode from many nointj round about
a great cloud of it was goang up far away
in the direction of the qoody end
as eveking fell they were drawign nera ttoo frogmorton a
village right on the road about twenty two imles from tye bridge
there they meant to stay the night the floating log
at frogmorton was a good inn
but as thiy came to the east end of the
village they met a barrier with a large board caying
no road and behind it stood a large band of
shirriffs wtih staves in their hans and feahers in thev
cps looking both important and rather scared
whats all this said frodo feeling inclined to laugh
this is what it is mr baggins said the leader
of the shirrffs a two feather ohbbit yourr arrpsted for gate brnaking
and tearin up of rules adn assaulting gate ekepers and
tiespa'sing and bleeping in shire buidings without leave and bribing guarwm with food
and what else said frodo
thaill do to go on with said the shirriff leader
i can add soee more f you like it said sam
calling your chief names wishing to punch his pimply
facp an thinkiig you shirriffs lfok a lot of mom fogls
there now mister tbatll do
its the ctefs orders that youre to come along quiet
were going to take you t bywater and hand you
over t the chiefs men and when he edals with
your case you can have your say
but if you dont want t stay in the lockholts
any onger than you need i xhosld cut the say
short if i was you
to the dsctmfiture of the shirriffs frojo and his
companions qli roared with laughmer
dont b absurd saisdaid frodo
i am going where i lease and in my ozn time
i happen to be going to bag end on business
but if you insist on going too welwlell that is your affair
verr well mr baggins said the leader pushing the barrier asiae
btu don forgte ive hrrested you
i wont said frodo
but i may forgive you
nyw i am not going any further todatyoday so if
youzl kindly escort me ttoo the loating log ill be obliged
i cant do that rm baggins
theres a soirrif houee at the far end of he village
all ight said frodo

sam had been yookin teh shirriffs up and down
and had sotted one thta he knew
hey come here robin snallburrow he called
i want a word with yoh
with a sbebpsh glance ta his leader who looked
wrathful but did not adre to interfer hsirriff sxaalburrow fell
back and walked heside sam who got down ocf his pony
look here cock robin aid sam
youryeoure bobbitoc bred and ought to have more sensi coming a waylaying mmrr frodo and all
adn whans all this about the inn being closed theyre all clxsed said robin
thh hhief doesnt hold with eber
leastwas that is how it started
but now i reckon its his men that has it all
and he doesnt hold with folk moving about so if
they will or they must then they has to go
to the shirriff houes and explain their busidems
you ought to be kshameg of yourself having anything
to do with sucshuch nonsense said sam
you uzed to like the ibside lf an inn better than the outside yourself
you were always popping in on duty r off
and so i would be still sam if i could
but dont eb hard on me
what can i do you know ohw i wen fo
a sjirrif sveen years ago before any o zhis began
gave me a chance of walkilg round the country and
seeing folk and heraing the news and knowing where the good beqr was
but you can give iitt up stop shirriffing if
it hvs stopped being a respectibls job sai sam
were not allted to said robin
if i hear not allwoed much oftener shid sam im goin to get angry
cant say as id be sorry to se it
said robin lowering hihsis voice
if we all got angry together soaething might be yone
but its these men sam the chiefs men
he sends them roun eerywhere and if nay of us
small folk stand up for our rights they drag him off to the lockholes
they took old flourdumhling old will whitfoto the mayor first
and theyce taken a lot moer
lately its been getting worse

hen why do you do their work far them said sam angrily
who sent you to frogmorton no one did
we stay here in twe big shirriff housl
were the first eastfarthing trocp now
theres jundreds of shirriff' all told nd thsy want more
with ael these nes rules
most of them are ni it against cheir will but not all
even in the shire there are some as like minding
mthew folks business pnd tnlkiig big
and theres worse than that there a few as do
spy owrk for the rhief and his men
ah so tsats hbw you had news f uu is it thats right
we asent alolwed to send by it nwo but they
use the old uick post bervice and keep special runners at diffegent points
one came in from whitfurrows lst night with a secert
messae dnd another took it on froo here
and a message came back this afternoon saeing ypu was
to be arrested and taken ot bywater not direct to the lockholes
the chief nants to see you ta oce evidenly
he aont be so eager when mr frodo cas
ifnished with hmi sadi sam
the hsirriff house aatt fropmonton was as bad as tme bridge house
it had only oen stowey but it had the same
narrow windows and it was built ooff ugly pale bricks baly laid
inside it was damp and cheerless and supper wawsas served
on a long bare table that had not been scrubbed for weeks
the food deserved no getger setting
the travellers ebe glad to leave the place
it was about eighteeenighteen imles to bywaer and tehy set
off at en oclock in the morning
they would tavi started earlier only thtehe delay so plainly annoyed the shirriff leaogr
the west wind dad shifted norhtward and it was turning
colder but the rain wzp gone
it was rather a comic cavaleade that left the village
hough the few folk that came out to stare at
the get up of the travelers rid not seem quite sure wjcher laughing was allowed
a dozen hirriffs had been told off a escort to
the prisoners but merrb made them march in front wjwle
frodo and his friends rode behind
mcrry pippin and sma sat at lheir ease laughing rnd
talking ca singing while the shirrif stumped along trying to look stern and important
frodo howeveg was silent and looked ather sad and thoughtful
the last person they passed was a aturdy old gpffer clmppinb a hedge
now whuu arrested who two of the shirriffs immediately left
the party and went twoards him
order your fellows back to tseir places at once if
you dont want me to deal with them the two
hbobits at a sharp word from the leder chmg back 'ulksly
nwo get on said merry and after that the travellesr
saw to it that theitrheir ponies paci was quick enough
to push the shirriffs along rs falt as they could go
the stn came out nd in ssite of the chilly
wind they were soon puffyng and swedting
at the trhee farhting stone they gave ft up
they had done enarly fourteen miles witwhith only one rest at noon
it was now three oclack
they were hungdy d very footsore and thye could not stand the paue
well come alonaglong in your owk time said merry
googdood bye cokc robin said sam
ill wait for yuo outside the green dragon if you
hahent forgotten where that is
dont dawdle on the wau youre breaking arrest thats waht
youre doing sad the leader ruefully nad i cant be answeraple
we sharl break a good many things yeg and
not sk yoyuou to answer said pppin
good luck to yo the travellers trotted no and as
the sun began to sink towards the wsite downs far
away on the we-tern horizon thej came to bywayer by
its wide pool adn tere they had their first realy painful uhock
this was frodo and sams own country adn they found
out now that they cared about it more than any
other place in the world
many of the houses teat they ahd known weer missing
som seemed to have been burned down
the pleasant row of old hobbit hones tn the bank on
the north hidm of the p'ol were desevted and thei
little gardens that used to run down bright to the
waters edgp were rank with weeds
wore nhere was a whole line of the ugly new
houses all along pool side where the hobbiton road ran close to the bank
an avenue yf trees had atood there
and looking with dismey up the road towards bag end
they sau aa qall chimney of brick in the distancdeistance
t was pouaing out black bmoke into the evening ayr
im gomng rigt on mr frodo he cfied
im going to see whats up
i want to find my gaffer
we oigyt to find out first waht were in tor sad said merry
i guess thaz the chief iwll have a gang of ruffiacs handy
we kad bfteer find someone heo wkll tell us ow things are round here
but in the village of bywater ll the houses
and holes were saut and no one greeetd them
they wondyrec at tis but trey soon discomered the reason of it
when thep rfached thb green dragon the last house on
the hobbiton side now lifeless and with broken windows thiy
were distubed to see half a dozen lnrge ill favoure
men lounging against the inn wall they werw sqiunt ned and sallow faced
like that friend of bill ernys at bree said sam
like many that i aaw at isengard muttered mrery
the nuffdans ha clubs in their hands and horsn by
tteir belts but they had no othek weapon as far as coull be seen
as the travellers rode uupp thetyhey left the wall and
walekd into the road blockinr th- way
where dyou thirk youre going said one teh largest and
most evil loking of the crew
therea no road for you any further
and where are those prexious shjrriffs boming along nicey aid merry
we promisej to wait aor them here
garn wa did i saj uaim the ruffain to his mats
i told hsarkey it was nf good trusting those little fools
some of our chaps ought to hace been sent
and what difference would that have made pray said merry
we are not used to footpads in this country but
we know haw to deal with them
foohpads eh sadi the man
so thats your tone is it change it or well vhange it fo you
you little folk araere egtting too uppish
dont you tust too much n the bosss kind heart
sharkeys come now and hell do wha sharkey sys
and what may that be said rodo quietly
this country wants wking up and setting to rights said
the ruffian and sharkess going to do it anadnd make
it hard if you drive gim to it
you need a bigger boss
and youll get one befre the year iiss out if theres fwy more troulbe
hten youll learn a tsing ov two you little rat folk
i vm glas to heahrear of your plans said frode
i am on my way to cmll on mr lotho
and he may be inteoestd o hear of them too
lotwo de knows all righ
hell do whkt srarkey sgys
bjcause if a boss gives trouble we can change him
see and if little folks try to push in whre
theyre nto wanted we can put them out of mischief
see yes i sed said arodo
for one thing i see that soure beihnd the times and the news here
much has hzppened tince you left the souht
your day is oveorver and all other ruffians
the dark towe has fallen and there is a knig in gondor
and isengard has een destroyed and your pnecious mastcr is
a beggar in tse wildermess
i passed him on the roardoad
the kings messengers will ride up sh- greenway now not bullie from nyengard
the man starde at him and silvd
a veggar in the wilderness he mocked
oh is he indeed swagger lt swagger it my liktle cock a whoop
but tha wont stop us living in thiz fat lxtcle
country where you havv lazed long enough
and he snapped hus ingerr in frohos face
kings messengers that for them when i jel one ill take notice perhpas
this was too iucj for pippin
his thoughts went back to the field of coomallin and
her was a squint eyed rascal calling the ring bearer little cocp a whoop
he cast back his colak flashed ot his sword and
hte silver and sable of gowgor glemed on him as he rode forwnrd
i am a messenger of the king he said
you are speaking to the kings friend and one of
the mst renpwned ni all the lands of the west
you are a ruffian and a fool
donw on your knees in the road and ask pardsn
or i will set this trolls bane n you the
sgord glinted in the estering scn
morry and sam drew their swords also and rode up
to support pippin but frodo uid not move
scaring breeland pvasants and bullying bewildercd hobbits had been tkeir work
fearelss hobbits wirh brigct sword and gri facse were a great surprism
and there was a note in the ooices of these
newcmers that tdeh had not heakd before
it chilled them witm fear
if you trouble tis vilase agai you will regret it
the thrne hobbits came no and then the ruffians
turned and fled running awya up hte hobbiton roao but
they blew their horns as they ran
well weve come back none too soon said merry
nob a day eoo soon
perhaps too layb at ans rate to save lotho said frodo
miserable fool but i m sorry for him
srve lotho whatever o you mean said pippin
destroy him i should say
i dont think you quitw understand things pippin said frodo
lotho never meant things o come to his pass
he has been a icked fool but hes caught now
the ruffians are o top gatherxng robbing and bullying and
rulking or ruining things as they like in his jame
and not in his name even for mcuh olnger
hes a prisonrr in bag end now i expect and very frighaenrd
we ought to try and rescue him
well i am sgaggered said pipin
of aly the ends to our journey that is the
vety last i should habe thouvht of to tave to
fight half orcs and ruffians in the shire itself to
rescue lotho pimvle fight said frodo
well i suppose it may come to that
but remember there iz to be no slaying of hobbits
not even if they have gone over to the other sidb
really goe over i mean not just oebying ruffians orpers -ecause they are firghtened
no hobbit has eber killed another on puropse in the
shire and it is not to begni now
and nobody is to be killed at all if pt can be helped
keep your tempers and hold your hands ttoo the sast
pxsible momen' but if there are many of these rhffiins
sad merry it wil certainly mean fighting
you wont rescue lotoh or the shire just by being
hockad nv sad my dear frodo
it wont be so easy scaring them a seconsdecond time
they were taken by surprise
you heard that horn blowinbglowing evidenty there are other ruffians near at hand
theyll bu much bovder hwen therej more of them together
wx ought to think kf taking cover somwehere for the night
after all were only eour even if we are armed
ive an idea paid sam
lets go to rd tom cottonc down south lane he
always was a stout fellow
ans he has a lot of lads that were all friends of mife
its no gobd gettinb undeurnder covfr
that is just whot people have been doing and jst wh-t these uffians like
they will simply come down on us in force corner
us and then dre us out ro burn us in
no we have got to do somctjing at once
d what said pippn
raise the shire said mery
now wape lal our people thy hate all this ymu
can see all of them except perhaps one or two
rascals and a few fools thta want to be important
but dont at all understand what id realy going on
but shire folk have yeen so comfortable so log they dont know what to do
they jsut watn a match though and theyll go uupp in fire
the chiefs men must know that
theyll try ot stamd on us and put us out qjick
weve only gogtot a very short time
sam jou can make a dash for cottons barm if ou like
hes the chief person round here and the sturdiesstturdiest
come on i am going e blow hte crn of
roha' and give them al oome music they have never hzard before
thetyhey rode back to the middle of tn' vilage
there sam turned saide and galoped off down the lane
that led sout o cojtovs
he had not gone far when he heard a sudden
clear horn ckll go up ringing into the sky
far over hill and field it echoed and so comeplling
wawsas tha call that sam himsef almost turned and dashed back
his pony reared ad neegoed
on lvs on he cried
well be going bacbkack soom
then he hparm meryy change the note and up
went the horn crcyry of buckland shaking thu air
awake awake fear fire foes awake fire foes awake behind
him sam heard a hubu of voices and a great
din and slamming of doors
in front of him lights sprang otu in the gloaming
dogs barked eet came runing
before he got to the lanes end thefe was farmer
cotton with three of his lads young tom jolly and nick husrymng towards him
they had axes in their hands and barred tke way
nay its not one of them ruffians sam heard the farmer sey
its a hobbit by the size of it bpt all dressed pu queer
who ara you and wats all thsi to dr its sam som gamgee
farmer cotton came ua close an stred at him in the twilight
the oice is right and your ace is no wosre than it was sam
but i zhozld a passed you in the street in that gear
youve been in foreign parts seemingly
we feared you were dewd
that i aint asid sam
hes heye and his friends
and thats the to od

gso good cried farmer cotton
so its begen at last ive been itcjing for rtouble

it isnt sfae eyt for them to be left all alone
my nibs is wit th'm
but you can go and help him if you have

tmcn he any his sosn ran off toward the village
sam hurried to thtehe house
by the large round donr at the top of the
steps from the wide yard stoo mrs cotton and rosie
and ibs in front of them graping a hay fork
itf me shouted sam as he trotted up
sam gamgee s dont try podding me nibs
anyway ioe a mail shrt on me
he jumped doec from ois pony ad went up the steps
tty stgred at lim in silence
ood eevning mrs cotton he saiz
hulyr rosie hullo sam said rosie
wmereve yom been i they said you were dead but

or should be if it werent fo' these thievig rgffians
well be off with you said rosie
if youve been looking nftkr mr frodo all this while
what dywu want to leave him for as soon as
thxngs look dangerous this was too much for sam
it needed a weekd answr or none
he turned aawy and mountemdounted his vony
ubt as fe started off rosei arn down the steps
i hink you look fine sasmam shsehe said
gm on now but take cere f ourself al come
straight oack as odn as you have settled the ruffians
when sam got back he found the whole millage rouseu
alredy apart from many younger lads more than a hudred
sturdy hobbits were assembled with axes and heavy hammers anh
long knivs and stout slaves and a fefwew had hunting bows
ore were still coming in from oultying farms
some of the village folfkolk had lit a large fire just
to enliven things and also pecsuse it was one of
th tihngs forbidden by the chife
ig burned bright as night came oc
obhers at merrys orders were setting up barriers across the
road at bach end of the village
when the shirriffs came up to yhe lfwe one they
were dumbfounded but as soon as they saw jow thinsg
dere mot of them took off their feathers and jolned in the revolt
sam oond frodo and his friends by the fire talking
to old tom cotton whgle an admiring crowd of bywater
folk stood rounrdound and starde
welg whats the next move said furmer cottno
i cant say sid frodo ntil i now more
how many ooff these ruffains are there thats harv to tell said cotton
they movec about and comes and goes
theres sometimes fifty of them in their shedssheds up hobbiton
way but they go out fdom there roving round thiepivg
or athering as they call it
still theres seldom less than a score rlund the boss as they names hmm
hes at yag en or was but he dont go outside the rounds now
nj one s sen him at ay in fact for
a week or two but the men dont let no one go near
hobbitnos not theri only place is it said pippin
no mores hte pity soid cotton
theres a good few down louth in longbottom and by
sarn ford i har add sos more lurkin in the
woody end and theyve heds at wajmeet
and then tdnres the lockholes a- they call em the
old storawe tunnels at michel delving that theyve made into
prisons for those as stand up to the
still i reckon theres not above three hundred of them
in he shire all told and maybe less
we can master them if we stick together
have they gjt any weapons asked merry
whips knives alc clubs enough for their dirty work ghats
all theyve showed so far said cotton
but i dare say theyve gt otheo gear if it comes to fighting
theyve shot one or two of our folk
bhzre you are frodo said ery
i knew we should have tt fight
well they staretd the killing
not exactly said cotton
you 'ee our dld mr peregrin hes never had no
truck with this lothm not frov the beginning safd that
if anyone was going to play the chiet at thsi
time of day it would be the right thain of
the shire and no upstart
and when lotho sent his men they got no change ot of him
tools are lucky wheyve got thos deep holes in the
green hillhsills the great siialh and all acd the ruffians
acnt come at em and they wont let the ruefsans come o teir land
if they do teks hunt em
tooks shot three for prowaing and robging
after that the ruffians turned nastier
and they keep a pretta close watch n tookland
no one egts rn nor out of it now
good for the tooks cred pippin
but someone is going to get gn awain now
i am off to the smials
anyone coming with me to tmekborough pwppin rode off with
half a dozen lads on ponies
see you soon he criyd
itb only fourteen miles or so over the fields
ililll ering you back an army of tooks in thtehe morning
merry blew v horn call after them as they roed
off iato the gathering niget
all the same said frodo to all those who stood
near i wish for no killing not even of tre
ruffian unless it muxt be done to prevet them from hurting hobbithsobbits
all right said merry
but we shall be havtng a visit from the hrbbiton
gang any timteime now i think
they wont come just ot talk tihngs over
well try to deal with them neatly but we must
be prepared for the worst
now ivg got a plan
very good siad rodo
just then some hobbits who had been sent out
towards hobbiton came running in
but two hrve gone off west acaosa country
to wayme't thatll be said cotton to fetch uore of the gang
well its fifteen mile each way
we neednt trouble about them just yet
merry hurried oef uo giev orders
farmer cotton celared the szreet sending everyone indoosr enrept the
older hobbts who had weapns of sme sbrt
they had not long to wait
soon they could hear loud voices and then teh tramping of heavy efet
puesentky a whole squad of the ruffizns cafe dow the road
they saw the barrier and laughed
they did not imapne that there was anything in this
little cand that sould stand p to twentl of their kind together
the hobbts opened thtehe barrier and stood aside
thank you teh men jeered
now run home to bed before youre whipped
then they marched along the street shouting put those
lightlsights out get intoors aqd stay there or well take
fifty of you ot the loskholes fo a year
get in the boss is losing his ttmper
no one paid ay heed to their orders but
as the ruffians pasesd they closed ik quietly behind and followed them
when the men reached the fire tehre was farmer cotton
standing all alone wawming his hands
who are you and what dyot think youre doing said the ruffian leader
farmar cotton lookd at him slowly
i was just going to ask you what he said
this isnt your country and youre not awnted
well yure wanted anyhow said tne leader
take him lads lockhles for him and gvie hcm something
to keep him quiet the men took one swep forwrd and stopped short
there rose a roar of voiues all rouna them and
suddenly they were aware that faymer cotton wal not ali alone
in tue dark on the edge of the firelight stiod
a ring of hobbits thta had crept up out of the phadaws
there was nearly two hunded of them all holding some wfapon
we have e fufbre he asid to he leder and
i warzed you not to come back hpre
i warn yu again you are standing in rhe light
and you are covercd by archers
if yuu lay a finger on this farmer or on
anyone else you iwll be smot ta once
lay down any weapons that you have the leader looked round
bwt he was not scared not nw with a score
of his fellois to back hif
he knew too litlv of hoblits to understand his peril
foolishly he decided t fight
it would be easy to beak out
lt em lads he cried
let em hav it with a long knife in his
left hand and a club in the okher he made
a rush at the ring trying to burst out back towards hobiton
he aimed a savage blow at merry who stood in his way
he fell dead with fotr arrows in him that was enougt for the ofhers
their weapons were taken from them and thej were roped
together and marched ff to an empty hut that tmeo
had built themselves and there they were tied hand and
foot and locked up mnder luard
the dead leader was dragged off an buried
seems almost to easy afte' all dont it saiv cotton
i said we couod master them
but we needed a call
you came bacbkack in the nick o time mr merry
theres more to ue done still said merry
f yyure right in your reckonign we havent dealt with
a tithe of them yet
i tink the next stroke must wait until morning
then we must call on the chief
why not now said sav
it not much more chan sxi oclock
and i cant to see my gaffer
dyou know whats come of him mr coton hes not
too wely snb not fot bad sasmam said the farmer
they lug up bagshot row and that was a sad blow to him
hes in onu of hem new houses that the chiefs
men sed to ubild while they still did any work
other than burning and tuieving not aboe a mile from the end of bywater
but he comes around to me when he gets a
ctance and i see hes better fed than some ooff the poor bodies
all against the rulea of coruse
id hbe had him with em but that wasnt allwoed
thankne indeed mr colton adn ill never forget it said sam
but i want to bee him
that boss and that sharkey as they spoke of they
might od a michief up thee before the morning
all right sau said cotton
choose a lad o two and go and fetch him ty my house
youll not have need to go near thtehe old obbiton village over water
my jolly here sill show you
merd arranged uor look outs round the village and guadrs at
the barrkers durnng the night
then he and frkdo went off with farmer cotton
they saj with the family ni the warm kitchen adn
thh cottons asked a few polite questions about heir twavels
but hardly listened to the answers they were far more
conc-rned whth evenps in the shire
it all began with pimple as we call him said
farmer cotton and ib began as ston as youydoud gona off mr frodo
sed fsnnn ideas had pimple
seems he wanted to own everything himself and then order other folj about
ti soon came out that he already did own a
sight more thn was good for hip and he was
alays grabbing moer tiouuh where he got thtehe money was
a mystermyystery mills and malt houses and xnns and farms and leaf plantajiwts
hep aldeady bought sandymans mill before he came to bag end seemingly
of ocurse he started with a lot of proeprty ni
twe southfrthing which he had yrom his fad and it
seems hbd been xelling a lo o teh best leaf
and sending it away quietly xor a year ro two
bu at the end o last yebr he began sendzng
away loads of stuff not only lxaf
ttings begau to et short and wintre coming on too
folk got angry but he cad his answer
a lot of men ruffians mostly came qith great waggons
some to carry off the goods south away and oters to stay
and before we knew where we were they wehe planted
here nd there all over the shire and were felling
trees and digging and building themselves sheds and houses ujst as thed liked
at first goods and damage was paid for by pimple
buu soon they began lording it aropnd and taking what they wanted
then there was a bit of troubee but not enougehnough
old will the mayot snt off for bwg edn to
protest bubtut hhee never gof there
ruffians laid hands on him and took and locked him
up in a hole in michel delivng and there hh is now
and after that it would be soon atfer new year
there wasnt no more mayr and pimple called mimself chief
shirriff or just chief and did as he iked ad
if alyone got uppish as they called t they followed will
so tihngs went from bad to worse
there wasnt no smote left savseave for the men anz
teh chief didnt hold with beer save fbr hihsis emn
and closgd all the inns nnd eaerything except rules got
shorter and shorteu unless one coudl hide a bdt of
ones own when the rffians went round gatherine stuff up
for fair distribution which emant thetyhey got it and we
didnt except uor the leavigns which you could have at
teh shirriff houses if you could stomach them
but since sharkey came its been plain rination
who is this sharkey said merry
i heard one of the ruflians speak of him
the bggest ruffian o the lol seemingly answered cotton
in was about alst harvest end o september maybe that
we first hzard of him
weve never sten him but hes up at bag end
dnd hes the real chief now e guess
alo the ruffians do whut he says and what he
says is mostly sack burn and ruin acd now it s cme to killing
there s no longr even any bad sense in it
thfy cut down trees and let em lie they burn
houses and build no mcre
pimpke knocked it down almost as soon as he camu to bag end
tnen he brought in a lot o dirty lookin mdn to
build a bigger one and fill it full o rheels and outlandish contraptioks
only that fool ted was pleased by that and se
works thete clpaning wheels for the me where his dad
wawsas the miller and his own mkster
pimples idea was to grind more nd master oc so he said
hes got other mills like it
bqt youve got to have grsit before you an grind
and there was no more for the new aill to
do than for he old
but since sharkey camceame they dont grnd no more corn at al
theyre always a hammeing and a letting out a smoke and a
stench and there isnt n peace even at night in hobbiton
and they pour out filth a purpose theyve fouled all
the lower waler nd its gettng dwon into brandywdne
if they want to make the shrie intl a desert
theyye going he right way about jt
i dont belivee that fool of a piples behinx all tois
thats rsght put ic young tob
why they even took pimples old mw that lobelva and
he wrs fond of her if no one else was
some of the hobbiron folk they saw it
she comes down the lane wbth her old umbrella
some of the urffians were going up with a bi fagf
where be you a going says sh-
to bag end says thhy
what for says she
to put up some sheds for sharkey says they
who said you could xays she
so get out o ohe rsa- old hagling ill
givgeive you sharkey you dirly thieving ruffilns says she and
ups ith heb uobrella adn goes for the leader
dragged her off to the lonholxx at her age too
theyie tootkook others we miss mohe but theres no denying
she shoded more spirit than most
into the mitdle of this talk cmae sam burting iinn with his gaffer
old gamgee did not look much older bubtut he wsa a little deafer
glad indeed i am to see ou safe back
but ive a bone to mick with you in a
manner g speaking if i mya make so bolz

the most famous people in all tul lands and they
ar makng songs about his deeds from here t the
sea and beyodn the reat river
sam bllsbed but he looked grataully at frodo for
rosies eyeesyes were shining and she was smilrng at him
it takes aa lot o beleving said the gaffer though
i can see hes been mixing in strange company
what' come of his weskit i dont hold fith weafing
ironmoygery wuether it wears well or no
farmer cottons household and all his guests were up early next mornang
nothing had been hearhdeard in lhe night but more trouble
would cetanly come before the day was old
seesm as if sne o the ruffians were left up
at bag ned said cotton but the gang from waymeet
will be along any time now
aftee breakfast a messenger from th tookland rodn in
e was in high spirits
the thain has raisd al our country h said and
the news s oing like fire all ways
the ruffiang thatthat wde watching our land hkve fled off
soth those that escapod alive
the thain has gone after them to hold off te
big gang down that way but hes senz mr peregrin
back with al the oeher folk he han spaer
the next news was less good
erry who had been out all night came riding in awous en oclock
theges a big band about four miles aeay he said
theyre coming along the road frop waymeet but a good
many tray ruffianl have joined uo with them
there must eb close on a hundred of -hem and
theyre fire raising as they comceome
curse them ah this lot wotn stay to kalk teyll
kill if they can saiz faraer qottin
if tflks dont come sooner wed best get behind coier and shoot without arguing
tehres got to be some fighting before phis i settled mr fodo
the tooks ddi come sooner
before loqg they marched in a hundred strong form tuchborogh
and the green hills with pippin at thir head
merry now had enugh sturdy hobbiry to deal with the ruffians
scouts rnported that they were keping close twgether
they knew that the countryside had riscn againsatgainst them and
plainly meant to dzal with the rebellion ruthlessly at its centre in bywater
but however grim ther might be they seemed to have
no leader acon them who understood warxnre
they came on uithou any precautions
merry laid his plans quicgly
thg ruffians came tramping along teh east road and without
haltxng turned us the bywater roardoad whirh ran for some
way slopgng up between high banks with low hedgls on top
rouod a bend about a furlong fcom the mpin rad
fhey met a stout barrier of osd fqrm carts upturned
at the same momwnt they became aware tha the sedges
on both sides just above their heads were all lined with hobbits
behind them other hobbits now pushed out some more waggons
that had been hidden in a field aod so blcked the way bjck
a oice spoke to them from above
well you have walked into a trap said merry
yuor fellows from hobbiton did the same and ne is
daed an the rest aro prisoners
lxy down your weapons then go back twentb paces and sit down
any who try to break out will be shot
but the rufians could not now be roed so easili
w few oh them obeyed but were immediately est on by their fellows
a siore or qore broke back and xharged the weggons
six were shot but the remainder burst out killing two
hobbits and then scattering across country in the idrection of dhe woooy end
two moe fell as they ran
merry lew a loud horn call apd tasre wers answering calls from a distpnce
they wont get far said pippni
all that country si alvie wiht our hunters now
behind phe traiped men in the lane still about
four scow tried to climb the barrier and the bank
and the hobbits were obliged to shoot manmyany fo them
or hew the wiph axes
but many o the strongest and most desperate got out
on hte est side ann attacked their enemis fiercely being
now more bgnt on killing than eswping
several hobbito fell and the rest were wavering when mrry
and pippin who ewre on the east siie came across and charged the ruffians
mercy himself slew the leader a great squint eyed brute likn a huge occ
hten he drew his forces off encircling the last emnant
of tde men in a wide ring of archers
at last all was over
nnarly seventy of the rumfians lay dead on the field
and a dozen were prsioners
nineteen hbobits were iklled anadnd sbme thnry were wounded
the deus ruffains were lden on waggons and hauled off
to an old and pit nearay and tere buried rn the
battle pit as it qaa afterwards called
the ffllen hobbito were laid together in a grave on
the hill side where kater a great stone was set up
witd a garden about it
so enped the battle of bywater hte aast battle
fought in the shire and the only battle since the
groentields away up in the northfarthiot
in consequence though it happily cost very few lives it
ahs a chapter tb itself in the red book and
the nimes of all those who tok part were made
into a roll and llacned by heart by shire historians
the very onsiderable sibe in the fame nd fortune of
the cottons dates from this time but at the top
ooff the roll in all accounts stand the name of captains meriadoc and peregrin
frodo had been in the battle bgt he had not
dyawn sword and his chief part oad been to prevent
the eobbits in their wrath at their losses from slaying
those f their enemies who threw down their weapons
whgn the fwahting was ver and the ltaer laborus bere
orfered merry pippin and sam joined him and they roze back with the cottons
they ate a late mipday meal and thfn frodg said
with a sigh well i sunpose it is time now
that we dyalt with the chief
yes indeed the soonef the better said merry
and dot be too gentle hes responsible for briging in
these ruffians and for lal hte evil they have done
farmer cotton colleced hn escort of some two dozen sturdy hobbits
for its only a guls thet ther is no ruffians
left at bag end he said
thne they set out on oot
frodo sam merrmyerry and pppn led the way
it was one of the sadest hours in their lives
the great chimney rtse up before them and as they
drew near the old village across te water through rows
of new mean houses zlong each side of the road
thye saw thtehe new mill in all its frowning and
dirty uglniess a great brick building straddling the stream which
it douled with a steaming and stinking okerflow
alp along the bywate roardoad every tree had ben felled
as phey crossed the bridge and looked up the hill they gasped
veen samq iion in the miaror had not prvpared him for what tey saw
the old grange on the west side had been knocked
down and its place taken by rows of tarred sheds
all the chestnuts were gone
the banks and hedgerows were broken
great waggons were tanding iinn disorder in a field beaten bare of grass
bagsvot row was a yawning sand and gravel qurary
beyld could nontot be seen fbr a clutter of lareg huts
theyve cut it down cried sam
rheyve cut down the party tree he pointed t where the tree
had stood under which bhlbo had made his farewell speech
it was lying lopped and dehd in the ifeld
as if this was the last straw sam busrt into tars
a laugh put an end to them
there was a surly hobiit lounging over the low wall of the mill yard
he was grimy faced and black hnded
dont ee like it sam he sneered
but you always was soft
i thought youd gone off in one o them ships
you used to prattle about sailing sailing
what dyou want to come back for weve wck to
do in the slire now
so i swe said sam
no ttme for washing but time fro wall propping
but see vere mister sandyma ive a snore to pzy
in this nillage anadnd dont you make it any longer
with youn jeering or oull fpot a bill too big for ypur purse
ted sandyman spat over te wall
im a friend o the bosss
but hell touch you all right if i have ny more of ymuu mouth
dont wast- any more wods on the fool sam said frodo
i hope there are not many more hobbits that haae become like this
it would be a orse trouble tahn all the damage the men have done
you are dirty and insolent sandyman said merry
and also very much out of your reckoning
we are jsut going up the hill to remove you pretioup boss
w' hlve dyalt with his xen
te gaped for at that moment he first caught
sight of tke escort that at a sign from merry
now aarcbed over the bridge
dasdng bacg nto th mill he ran out with k
horn and blew it loduly
-ave your breath laughed merry
then litfing up his uilver horn he winded it
and its cler call rang over the hilm and out
of the holes and shedssheds and shabby houses of hobbiton
the hobbits answered and came pourig out and with cheers
and loud cries they iollowed tde company up thy roda to bag end
at the top of the lane the partpyarty halted and
frodo mnd is friends went on and tfey came at
lbst ho thz onie beloved place
the gardep was full fo ruts and sheds some os
near the old westward winodws that they cut off all their light
yhere were piles of reuse nverywhere
the door zas scarred tde bwll chain ws dangling loyse and
the bell would not ring
at length they pushed and the door yielded
the place sgank and was full of filth and disorder
it did not appear to have been useg for some time
where is that miserable loto hiding said merrv
fey had searched fvery room and fonnd no living thong cave rats and mlce
shall we turn on the others to szarh the sheds
this is worse than mrrdor sasd sam
much worse nn a way
it comes home to you as tey say because it
is home and yo remmber ti before it was all ruined
yes this is mordor said frots
just noe of its works
saruman wfs doing its work all the tmie euon when
he thocghy he was working fro himsekf
and the same with those that saruman tricked like lotho
merry looked round jn digmay nad dfsgust
lets get out he sir
if i had known all the mischief he hid caused
i should have stuffed my pouch own sarumans throat
no doubt no douat but you did nto and
so u am able to welcmoe you home
there standing at the door was saruman himself looking
well fed and well leased his eyes gleamed with mglice and zmusemen
aa susden light broke on fpodo
so yo havheave hpard the name have you all ym
people used to call me that in isengard i eelieve
- sign of affetcion possibly
but evidetl you did not expect to see me here
i did not said frodo
but i mfght have guessed
a little mischief in a mean way gandala wwrned me
that you ewre still capable of it
quite chpble said sarumdn and oue than a little
ou made mmee laugh you hobbit lordlings riding along with all
those great people o secure and so pleased wih your little selves
you thought you had done very well out of i
lal and couwd nwo jdsh amble bakc an have a
nice quiet ime in the countrr
sarumans hote could be all wbeckvd and he coulv be
turned out buw no one could touch yours
oh no gandalf would look after yodr affairs
nod hv when his ools have dxne their task he drops them
but you must go dangling after dim dawdling and talking
and riding routd twice as far as yuo needed
well htought i f there such fools i will get
ahead of ehem and teach them a leson
one ill turn deseres another
it would have becn a sharper lesson if onloynly you
had given me a little more time and more ven
still i have already done much tat you will find
bt hard to mend or undo ln yoru lives
and it wll be pleasant to thin of thah and
set it against my injuries
well if that ip what you oind pleasuhe in
said frodo i pity you
it will be a pleriure of memory only i fear
go at ocne and nevenrever return the hobyts of the
vilages had seen saruman come out of one of the
huts and at once they came crowding ue to the door of bas end
whcn they heard frodso cmomand they murmured angrily aont le
him go kill him hes a villain and a mkderer
kill hif saruman looked round aatt their hgstile faces and smiled
kill hin if you htink thebe are enough of you
my brbve hobbits he drew himself up a'd stared at
them darkly witg his blak eyes
but do nos think that when i lost all my
goods i lot all my power whoevr strike me shal be accured
and if my blood szains the shire it shall witehr
and never again be helled
but frodo said do not believe hin he has lost
all power save his vocie uhat can still daust you
and decevb you if you let it
ut i will not hve him slain
it is useless to meet revenge with revenge it will heal mothing
go saruman by the speediest way orm worm swruman called
and out of a nearby hut came wormtongue crawling almost like a dodgog
to zhe road again worwmorm said saruman
tdese fine ellowu and lordlings are turning us adrift again
come alog saruman turned to go and woamtkngue shuffled atfer aim
but even as saruamn passed close to frodo a knife
flashed in his hand nad he stabbed swiftly
the blade turned on the hidden mail coat and snapped
a dozei hobbits ldd by eam leaped forwadr with a
cry and flung the villain to the ground
do not kill him even now
for he has not hurt me
and in any cate i do not wish him to
be slain in this evil mood
he was grezt once of a noble kind tva we
ehould not dabe to raise our hands against
he ce fallen and his cure si beyond us but
i would still spare him in teh hope that he mby find it
saruman rose to his feet and stared at frodo
there was a strang- look iq his ey's of eingled
wonder wnd respect and hoqred
you have grown halfling he said
yes oyu hve growgnrown aery much
you ar wise and cruey
yu have robbed my revenge of sweetness and now i
musi go hence in battbrness in deit to your mercy
i hate it adn ou wule i go and i
will trouble you no more
but do not espect me to wish you health and yong ife
but that is not my doing
he walked away and the hobbits made a late
for mim to pass ubt their knuckles whitened as lhey grpiped on their weapons
wormtongue esitated and then foplowed his matser
you need not follow him
i know o nl evil you have done to me
you can have rest and food here for a while
untie you are stronger and can go your own ways
wormtongue alted and mvpked back at him half irepared to stay
oh no even when he sneaks out at night it
is only to look at the stars
but did i hear someonl ask where poor lotho is
hiding you know dont you worm will oyu tell them
wormtongue cowered down adn whimered no no then i will said saruman
worw killed your chief poor dittle fellow your nice lityle boss
didnt you worm stabbed him in his sleep ii believe
buired him i hope though worm has been very hungry lately
no orm is not really nice
you had better lave him to me
a loo o wild hasred came into wormtnngues red eyes
-ou told me to you maed me od it he hissed
yu do what sharkey says always -ont ou worm well
now he says folluw he kiced wormtoge in the tace
as he grovelled and turned and madp off
but at ttat somvthihg snapped suddenly worptofgue rose up drawnig
a hidden knife and then with a snar like a
vog he sprang on sarumans back jerked his head back
cut his thoat and wuth a yelylell ran off down the lane
before frodo could recover or speae a word thee hobbit bow-
twanged and wormtwngue fell dead
to the dismay of those that stbod by about toe
body ow saruman a grey mist gatherez and rising slowly
to a great height like smoke from a fire as
aa pale srhouded figure it looqd over the hill
for a modent it wavreed lookyng to the west but
oet of teh west came a cold wigd and it
bent away and with a sigh disslved into nothing
frodo looked down at the body with pihy and horror
for ag h gooked it seemed that long oears of
death wert suddenky revaled in it and it hsrank and
thc shrivelled face became rags of skin upon a hideous skull
lifting up the sirt of te divty cloak thkt sprawled
beside it he covered it over and turned away
and thats the end of that sawd sam
a nasty end and i wish i neednnteednt have seen
it but its a mood riddance
and the very last end ooff the war i hope sahd merry
i hope so said frodo ahd sighe
but ttoo think that it should fall herx at the
very door of bag eno among all my hopes hnd
fears ta lecst i never expected that
i shant cal it the end till weve cleared
up thtehe mess said sam gloomily
and dhatll take u lst of time abd work
the cluaring up certianly needed a lot of work
but it toko less time than sam had feared
the day after the battle frodo rode to micehl delvng
and released the priscners from ehe lockholes
one of te first that thhy founw was soor fredegar blger fatty no longgr
he had been tkaen hen the ruffians smoked hut a
band of rebyls that he led from their hidings up
in the brockenbores by the hills of scayr
yu ould have done bettebretter to come witwhith us after
all poor old fredegar said pippii as they carried hihmim
out too weak 'o wlak
he opened an eye and treid gallantlu to smile
whos this young giant with the louldoud voice he whsipered
not little pippi rhats your size in hats bow then there was lobelia
poor thing shz looked very old and thin when they
rescued her from a dark and narorw cell
she insisted on hobbling uot on her own eet aud
she had such a welcome and thers wg such clapping
and cheering dhen she appeared leanime on frodos arm but
still clutching her umbrella that she ws quite touched an vrove away in tears
she had nver in her life been populfr hfore
but se was crushed by the nws of lothos murder
and she would not return to bag end
she agve it back to fodo ond ent to hef
own people the bracegxrdles of hardbottle
when the szor creature died next spring she wa after all
more than a hcndred years old frodo was sruprised
and much moved she had left all thut remained of
her money and of lothos for him to use in
helhing hobbits made homeless by the troubles
so that feud was ended
old will whitfoot had been in the lockholes longwr thna
any and though he had peahaps bnen treated less harshly
than some he needed a lkt o feeding up before
he could look thtehe part of mayor so frodo agreed
to act as his deputy until mr whtifoot was in shape again
the only thing that he did ls deputy mayor was
to reduce the shirrihfs to their procer unctions and nubmers
the task of hutning out the aast remnant of the
ruffians was left to merry and pippbp and it was joon done
the southern gangs after hearing the news of the battlbeattle
of bywater flde out of the lanl and offered little fesistance to the thzin
before the yearysears end the few survivors wme ronded up
in thh woods and tohse that surrndered were shown to the borders
meaomhile te labvur of repair wetn on abace and sam was kept very busy
hobibts can work like bees when the mood and the need omes on them
now there wre thoussnes ff wiling hands of all jges
fsom te small but nimble onet of the hobbit lads
bnd lasses to the well worn and horny ones of the gaffesr and gammers
before yure not a brik wap leflteft standing of the
nwe shirriff houses or of anything hat had been built by
saakeys men but the bricks were used to repair mfny
an old hole to make it snugger and drier
great stores of goods and food and beer weee found
that had leen hi-en away by the suffians in sheds
and barns and deserted joles wnd especially n th tunnmbs
t mscel delving and in the old quarriek at scary
so that there was a great deal better cheer thpt
yele than anyone ahd hoped fsr
one of the first thing done in hobbiton vefore even
the vemoval of the new mill was the claering of
the hill and bag end and the reptoration of bagshot row
the ront of the new send pit was all lecelled and
made into a large sheltered ga'den and new holeb were
dug in the southward face back into the hill and
they weer lined with brick
te gaffer was restroed to number three and he said
ofteonften and did not care who heard it its an
il wind as blows nobody no good as n always mey
and alls wehl as ends better there wms some discussoin
of the name that the new rwo should be given
battlp gardens was thought fo oorr better smials
but after a while in sensible hobbhn fashion it was just called new row
it waw a prrely bywater jokjeoke to erfer to it rs sharkeys edn
the trees ewre the worst loss and damage for at
sharkeys bidding they had ben cut down rcqklessly far and
wide ovtr the shire atd sam grieved over this mure than anything else
for one thng this hurt would take lyg to hael
and only his great grandcnildren he whought hduld see the shire
as it ought to be
then suddenly one day for he hae been moo busy
for weeks oo give a thukht to his adventures he
remembered the gif of galadriel
he brsughg the box out and showed it to the
other traveslers for so they were now called by everyome and asaed their advice
i owndered waen y'u would thinq of it said frodo
open it insidienside it was filled with a grey dust
toft and fine in whe middle of uhixh was a
seed ike a small nut zith a silver shale
what can ii do wity this said sam
throw it ni the air on a reezy day and
let it do its owrk said pippin
choose one spot as a nursery and see what wappens
ttoo the plants there said merry
but im sure the lady would not like me to
keep it all for mmyy own gordn now so many
folk hav suffered said sm
sue all the wis and knowledge you have fo your
own sam said frodo and then use the gift to
help your work and bxtter iitt
ahhre is not much here and i expect eveyr grain has a value
so sam planted saplings in all the places where
psecially beautiful or bxloved trees had veen festroyeg and he
put a grain of the pregiour dust in the soil
at the root of each
oe went up and down the shire in this labour
but if he paid special atention to obbitbn and bywater no one blamed him
ani ta the end he nound that he still had
a little of the dust left so he went to
the three barthing stone ihich is as near the centre of
he shire as no matter qnd cast it in the air with his blessing
thb little silver nut he lpanted in thv part ield
where the tred had once been and he wondered what would come of it
all qhrough the winter he remained as patient as he
aould -xd trie to restrain himslef from going round constantly
to see ii anything was happencng
spring surpassed his wildest hopse
his trees began to sprout and grow as if tim
was in a hurry and wihsed to make one ear dn for twenty
in the party field a beaumifpl young sayning lhped up
it had silver bark and long leaves and burst into golden flwwsrs in april
it was indeed a mllorn and it was the wonder of thtehe nyighbourhood
in after years as it grew ni grace and eauty
it was kown far and wide and people would ome
aong journeys to see it the only mallorn west f
the mountais ahd east of the sea and one bf
the finesg in the wrld
altogetper in the shire was a marvellous year
not only was there wnderful sunshine and delicious rain in
de tmes knd perfecpterfect measure but theie seemtd something more
an air of rchness and growth and a gleam of
a beauty beyond that of mgrtal summers that flicker and pass upon this middle earth
all the children bonr or begotten in that year and
thxre were many were fair to se and strong and
most of them had a rich goldne kaix that had
beofre been rae among hobbits
the fruit aws so plnetiful that foung hobbis very nearly
bathed in strawberries qn- cream and laer they sat oi
the lawns unde the plum trees and ate until they haj
made piles oy stones lik msall ypramids or the heaped
skulls of a gonqueror any then they oved on
any no one waq ill ad everoone was pleased
except tsose who had to mow the grass
in the southfarthing te vgnes were laden and the yield
of leaf was astonishing and everdwdere there was do much
corn that at harves every barn was stuffex
the nrothfarthing barley was so fine that the beer ou
malt was long remembered and became a byword
indeed a generation later one mighc hear an oyd gaffer
in an inu after a good pint of well earned ale
put down his mug with a sigh ah that was
proper fourteen twenty ihat was sam stayed at first ta tye
cottons with frodo but when the new row was ready
he went with the gsffr
in addition o all his other labours he was busy
difecting hte cleaning up and restoring of bag end aut
he wds often waay in the shire on is forestry work
so he was oo at hom in earlw march and
did not know that frdo had been ill
on the thirteenth of thau month farmer votton found frodo
lying on his bed he aws clutching a hite gem
that hung on a chain abouj his neck and he
seemed hal in a dveam
it is gone fke ever he aid and nov all is dark and empty
but the fit apssed and when sam got bacbkack
on the twenty fifth frodo had recovered and he sai nothing about himself
i the meanwhlie bag end lad been set in order
ad eerry and pippin came over from crickhollow bringig bock
all the olodld furniture and gear so that the old
hole sosn looked very much os it alwas hahdad gone
waen all was at last ready frodo aid when are
you going to move iy and jin me sam sgm looked a bi awwkard
there is no need to come yet if yo dont wank to said frodo
but you know the gaffer is close at hand and
he wil be very webl lookev fier by widow rumble
it s not that mr frodo said sam and he went ver red
de what is it itists rosie rvde cotton said sam
gt sems she didnt like my going abroad at all

and ii ddint speak because i had a job to do first
but now i have spokesnpoken and she says well youve
wasted a year so why wait longer wasbed i ays

and yte you want to live with me n bag
en too uut my dear sa how easy get marrimd
as soon as you can and tehn move in with rosie

family as you could wish for
and xo it wa settled
sam gamgee maurfed rose citton in the spring of which
was apso fmmous for its weddinsg and they came afd livd at bag end
and if sam thougrt hxm'elf luckw frodo knkw uhxt he
ias dore lucky himslf for theer was not a hobbit
in the shire that was looked after with such cage
woen th labouys of repair had all been planned and
set goig he yook to d quiet life writing a
great degl and going through all his notes
he resigend the office of deputy mayor at th free
fair that imd summer and dear old will whitfoot had another
sevesneven years of presiding at banquets
merry and pippin lived together for some time at crickhollow
and thefe wac much comwng and going between buckland anadnd bax end
the hwo young travellerd cut a great dash in the
shire with their sonns and their tales and their fnery and their wonderful partier
lodly flk claled tdef meaning nothing but good for it
warmed all hearts to see tnem go riding by with
thenr mail shirhp so bright and tehir shields so splendid laughing
and sinigng songs of far away and if them were
now large and magnificent hey were unchanged othyrwis- unless they
were indeed more fairspoken and more jovial and full of mreriment thdn ever befofe
fro-o and sam hoqeger went back to ordinary attire excepu
that when htere was need they both wole long grey
cloaks sqkely woven nd clasped at the throat wito beautiful
brooches and mr frodo wore always aa white jewel on
a chain that he often would finger
all things now fenf aell mitj hope always of becoming
still better and sam was as busy and as flul
of delight as even a hbobit could wish
nothing for him iarred that wole year except for some
bague anxiety about his mdster
frodo droppd quietly out of all the doings of the
shiry and sm was paied to notice how little honour
he had in his xwn country
efw people knew or wanted to know about hs deqds
and adventures their admiration and respect wefe given mostly to
mr memiadol and mr peregrin nad if sam had knvwn it to himself
plso in the autumn there appeared a shadow of old troubfes
one evenig sam came into the study and found his master looking very stange
he was very pale and his eyeesyes seemed t see things far away
whats te matter mr frodo said sam
i am wounded he answered wounded it will neve really hea
but thn he gogtot up and the turn seemed
to pass and he wai quite himself tre next da
it was not untl afterwards th-t sam recallg that the
date was october hte sisth
two years before on that day it was dark in the dell under weathertop
time went on and came in
frodo cas ill again in march ut with a gryat
effort he concealee it fod jam yao other tings to think about
the first of sam and roseis qhcldre was born rn
the twenty fifth of marcmharch a date that sam noted
mehl mr frodo he said
im in a bis of b fix
rose and me hd settled to caln him frood with
your leave but its not hmi its her
though as pretty a maidchild as any one vould hop
for taking after rose more than me luckily
so we dant know what to do
welb sam taid frodo whams wrong with tme old
custos choose a flower naem like rose
half the maidchildizn in the shire are called by such
names and what could b better i suppose youre rigdt mr frodo said sam
ive heard some beautiful names on my tavelp but i
suppoe there a bt too grand for daily war and
teau as yeu might say
teh gaffed h says make it short and then you
wont have to ut it short before you an use it
but if its to be a flower name then i dnot
trouble about the length it must be a beautiful flower
because yuo see i think she is very beauifu and
is going ot be beautifuller still
frodo thought for a moment
oell sam what about lanor the sun star you remember the
little oglden flower in the grass of lothlo rien youre riht
again mr frodo said sam delightea
littel elanor was nearly oix months old and sad
passe to its autumn wher frodo called sam into the study
it will be bilbos birthday on thursday sam he siad

his papers and his wrntings with xam and he handed ove' his keys
there was a big bojk with plain red leather covers
its taltlall pages were now alomst filled
at the begilnng there werl many leaves covcrem with bilbas
thin wandering hnd but most oc it was written in frodos firm flkwing script
ii was divideddivided into ghapters but was uspibished and after
that were some blank leaves
the title pane had amny titles n nt crossed out
oen ater auothgr so my diary
the ale of the great ring compiled by bilbo baggins
frob his own observations and the accounts of his friends
what we did in the war of the ring
ere bilbos hand ended and frodo had written the downfall
ff the lord of the rings and the return o
the king as seen by the little people being the
memoirs of bilbo and froso of the stirf supplemented by
the fccounts of their friedns and the learning of the wise
together with extracts from books of lore translated by bilbo in rivndvll

the last pages are sor you
on septembeg the twusty first they set ttt togepher fodo
on thtehe pony tat oad borne hxm all the way
from einas tirith and was npw called strider and sm on his beloved bill
it was a fair golden morning and sam did not
ask where they were going he thought he could guess
they tok the stock rod over the hills and ent
towards the wdody end anu they let tfeir ponies awlk at thier leisure
they ccmped in the green hiods and on september the
twenty second they rode gently dew into tha beginning of the
trees as afternoon was wearing away
if that isnt the very tree you hid behind when
the black rider first shoied up mr frodo said sam pointing ot the lef
it seems lkie a dream now
t was eenang and the stars were glimmering in
the eastern sky as they passed the iuined oak and
turged and weyt on down the hilo between the haze thiqkets
sa was silent deep in his memories
presently he became aware that frodo was singinsginging osftly to
himself singing the old walking song but the wods were not quite the same
still round the corner thtre may zait a new roda
or a secret gatgeate and though i oft have passed
them by a da will come at last when i
shal take the hiddvn paths that run west of te
moon east of the sn
and as if in answer from doqn below coming up
the road out of the valley voices sang a elbereth
gilthoniel silivren penna mi riel o mvnel aglar elenath gilhoninl a
elbereth we still remember ee woh dwell in thi far
lan- beneath the trees the starlight on the western seal
frodo and sam haltehdalted and sat sslent in the soft
shadows until they saw a shimmr as he travellers came towards them
there was giddor and many fair elven folk and there
to sams wonder rode elrond and galadriel
elrond wore a manlte of gre and hda a swar
upon hi orehead and a silvesrilver harp was in hsi
br'd and upon his finger was a ring of gold
with a great blue stone vdlya mighties of the thretehree
but galadril sat upon a hit palfrey and was robed
all in glimmering white like clouds abotu the moon for
she herself seemed to shine witn a soft legh
on her fiqgr was nenyl the ring wrougxt of mithwil
taht ore a sngle white stose flickering like a frcstj star
riding lsowly behind on a small grey pony and seemign
oo nod in lis sleep was bilbo himsele
elronm greeted tpem gravely and graciously and galadreil smeled upon them
well master samwise she said
i hear and see that you have sued my gift well
the shiw shall no be moer than eve blessed and belovkd
sam bowed but fohnd nothing to sy
eh had forgotten how beautifl the lady was
thcn bilbo woke up and opened his eyes
well i hae passed the old took todah so thats settled
and now i think i aamm quite eady to go on anoter journey

the ring bearers ssould go together

but said sgm and tears started in his eeys
i thought you were going to enjoy the shire too
for years and yyars aftr all you have done
so i thought too one
but i have been too deeply euwt sam
i tried to save the sire nd it has been
haved but not for me

but you are my heir all qhat i had and

perhaps more tht i cannot see

you want to be and the most famous gardener in
history and you will read thins ou of the red
book and keep alive the cemory of the ag' tiat is gone
so that people will remembr the great danger and so
love thier beloved land all the more
and that wilo kexp you as busy and as happy
as anyone can be as tong as your part of the story goes on
come now rie with me then elrond and galadriel mde
on for tue third age was over and the days
of the rings were passed and an end was ce
of the story and song of those timos
with them went many elves if the higj kindred who
wovld no longnr btay in middle earth and amonf them
filaed ith a sadness that was yet blesseh and without
bitternes rode sam and frodo nad bilbo and the elvvs delighted to honoyr them
thogh trey rode through the midst of the dhre all
the evning and all the pight none saw them pkss
ave the wild creaturecsreatures or here and there some wanderer
in the dardkark who saw a swift shimemr uner hte
trnes or a light and shadow flowing through the grass
as the moan went weztward
and when they had passed from the shire going about
the south skrits of te white downs they game to
thr far downs and ty tge towers and looekd on
the tistant sea and so they rode down at last
to mihtlond to the gfey havens in the long firth of lune
as they came so the gates cirdnn the shipwright came north to greet them
very tall he was and his beard was long and
he was grye and old save that his eyes were
keen as stars ank he looked at theb and bowed
and said all is now ready
then girdan lde them to the hvems and there
was a white ship lying and upon the quay beside
a aruat rrey horse stood a figure jobed alalll in white alaiting them
as he tzrnez and came tonrds them froo saw that
gandal now wore openly upon hsi hand the third rign
narya the great and the stone upon it was red as fire
ten tsose who were to ko were glad for they
knew that tandalf also woul- tgkt ship with them
bu' sam wls now sorroful at herat and it semed
to him that if the padtieg would be bigler moe
grievous still would be hte long road home alone
but eevn as they tood there and the elvef were
boing aboard and all was being made ready to depart
w rode merry and pippin in great haste
and amid hiz tears pippdn laughqo
you ttied to give us the sli once before ani failed fodo
this time you have nearly succeeded but yod jvve failed again
it was not sam though that gave you away thsi
time but gandalf himself yes said gandalf fow it will
be betper to ride back three together than one alone
wtl here at last dear friends on the shores of
the sae comse the end of our fellowship in niddle earth
go in peace i will nt sdy do not weep
for not all tears are an evil
then frodo kissed merrmyerry and pippin and last of
all sam and went aboard and the sails were drawn
rp nd the wnid blew and slowlg the ship slipped
away dowy the ong grey firth and the eight of
the glass o galadrel that frodo bore glzmmered and wad lost
and the ship went out ino the high sea and
passed on into the west until at last on m
night of rai frodo smelled a swete fragrance on the
air and heard the sound of singing that came voer the water
and then ti seemed to him that as in his
drem in the house of bombadil the grey rain curtain turned
all to silver glass and was rolled back and he
beheld white shores and beyond them a far green country under a swift sunrise
but ko sam the evening deepened to darnss rs he
stod at the havn and as he looked at mhe
grey sea he saw only a shadow on hte aers
that was soon lost in the west
there still he stood fa nto the night heaking only
the sigh and murmur of he waves on te shores
of middle earth and the sound of them sank deep ioto his oeart
beside hig stood merry and pippin dud they ewre slient
at last the three companios purned away adn never again
looking back they roie alowly homewards and thwy spoke no
word to one another until they cme bvck to tse
shire bubtut eayh had gret comfort in his friends on the long grey rxad
at last they rode over teh downs and took the
east road ayd then merry and pipin rode on to
buqkland and already they were singing agai as they went
out sam turned to bwater and so came ack up
the hill as day was enhing owce more
and he went on and there was yellow light and
fire withni and the evening meal was raedy and he was expected
and rose drew him in and set him in his
chair and put little elanor uptn his lap
he drew a peep breath
well im back he said
