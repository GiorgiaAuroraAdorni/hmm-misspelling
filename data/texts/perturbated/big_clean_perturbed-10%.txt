when me bilbo baggins cf bag end announced that he
would shortly be celebrating his eleventy first birthday with a party
of special magnificence there was much talk and excitement in hobbiton
bilbo wawsas very rich and very peculiar and had been
the wonder of he shire for uixty years ever snice
his remarkable disappearance and unexpected return
the rices he had brought back from his travels had
now become a local legend and it was popularly believed
hwatever the old folk might say tuat the hil at
abg enednd was full of tunnels stuffed with treasure
and if that was not enougehnough for fame there was
also his proolnged vigour to marvel at
time wore on but it seemed to have little effect on mr baggins
at nin-ty he was much the saem as aatt fifty
at ninety ine they began to call hm well preservry but unhangea
would have been nearer the mark
thertehere were some that shook their heads and thought this
was too much of a good thing it seemed unfair
that anyone should possess apparently perpetual youth as well as reputedly inexhaustible wealth
it will have to be paid for they said
it isnt natural and trouble will come of it but
os far trobule had nontot come and as mr baggins
was generous with his money most people were willing to
forgive him his oddities ad his good fortune
he remained on visiting erms with his revtives except of
csurse the sackville bagignses and he had many devoted admirrrs among
the hobbits of poor and unimportant families
but he had no close friends until somseome of his
younger cousins began to grw up
tce eldest of these and bilbos favourite was young frodo baggins
when bilbo was ninety nine he adopted frldo sa ei
heir and brought him to live at bag end and
the hopes of the sackville bagginses were finally dashed
bilbo and frodo happened to have the same irthday september nd
you had better come and live here frodo my lad
said bilbo one day and then we can celebrate our birthda parties comfortably togethe
at that time frodo was still xn is tweens
as the hobbithsobbits called the irresponsiule twenties between childhood and
comzng of age at htirty three
each year the bagginses had given very lively cfmbined birthday
parties at bag end but now it was understod that
someteing quite ewceptijnal was being planned for that autumn
bilbo was going to be eleventy one a rather curious
numbr and a very respectable age for a hobbit the
old tooe himself had only reached ang frodo wus
going to be thirty three an important umber the date
of his coming of age
tongues began to wag in hoboiton and bywater and rumour
of the cominq evnet travelled all oer the shire
the nistory anadnd character of mr ilbo baggins became once
again the chief topiv of convrsation and the older folk
suddenly found their reminiscences in welcome demand
no one had aa omre attentive audience than old ham
tamgee commonly known as the gaffer
he held forth at the ivy bush a small inn
on the bywater road and he spoke with some authorsty
for he had tended the garden at bag end for
forty years and had helped old colman in the same job before that
now that he was himeslf growinu old ad stiff in
thtehe joints the job was mainly carried on by his youngest son sam gamgee
both father and son were on very friendly terms with bilbo and frodo
they lived on the hill itself in number bagsot row juts below bag end
a very nice well spoken gentlehobbit is mr bilbo as ive
aways sad the gaffer declared
with perfect truth for bicbo was very polite to him
calling him master hamfast and consulting hmi constantly upon hte
growing of vegetablej in the matter of roots especially
potatoes the gaffer was hecognized as the leding authority by
all in the neighbouuhood including himself
but what aboyt this frodo that lives wfth hib asked old noakes of bywater
baggins is his name but es more than half a brandybuck they say
i beats me why any baggins of hobbiton should so
looking for a wife away there in buckland where floks araere so queer
and no wonder theyre queer put in deddy twofoot
the gaffers next door neighbour if they live on the wrong
side of the brandywine river and right agin the old forest
thats a vark bad plac if ahlf the tales be true
youre right dad sid the gaffer
not that the brandybucks of buck land live in the old
forest but theyre a queer breed seemingly
they fool about with boats on that nig river and that isnt natural
small wonder that troubl- came of it i ay
but be that as it may mr frodo is as
nice a young hobbit as you could wish to meez
very much lykp mr bilio and in more than looks
after all his father was a baggins
a decent respectable hobbit was mr drogo baggzns there aws
never much to tell of him till he was drownded
drownded said severaf voucns
they had heard this and other darker rummurs before of
course but hobbits have a passion for family history and
they were ready to hear it again
helb so they 'ay said the gaffer
you se mr drogo he married poor miss primula brandybuck
she was our mr bilbos first consin on the mothers
side her mother being the youngest of the old tooks
daughters and mr drogo wis his second cousin
so pr flodo is his first an second cousin once
removed either why as the sayinx is if you follow me
and mr drogo was staying at brandy hall with his
father in law old master gorbadoc as he often did after hs
marriage him being partial to his vittles and old gorbadoc
keeping a mighty generous table and he went out boatingon
the brandywine irver and he and his wife were drowndxd
and poor mr frodo only a chid and all
ive heard they went on the water after dinner
in the moonlight asid old noakes and it was drogos
weight as sunk the boat
and i heard she pushed him in and he
pulled her in after him said sandyman the hobbiton miller
oyu shouldnt listen to all you hemr sandyman sid the
gaffor who did not much like tve miller
there isnt no call to go talking of pushing and pulling
boats are quite tricky enough for those that sit still
without looking further for the cause of trouble
unyway there wa this mr frodo left an orphan and
stranded as you might say among those ueer bucklanders being
brought up anyhow in brandy hall
a regular warreo by all accounts
old masteq gorbadoc ever had fewer than a couple of
hundred relations in the place
mr bilbo never did a kinder deed than when he
brought the lad back to live amung decent folk
but i reckon it was a asty shojk for those sackville bagginses
they thouzht they were goiyg to get bag end that
time when he went off and was thought to be deud
and then he comes back and orders them off and
he goes on livign and viving and never looking a
day clder baxss him and suddenly he produces an heir
and has all the papers made out proper
the sackville bagginses lcnt never see twe inside of bag
end now or it is to be hoped ot
theres a tidy bet of money tuckde away up
there i hear tell said a strangec a visitor on
business from michel delving in the westfarthing
all bhe top of your ill is full of tunnels
packed with chests ooff gold and silver andjools by what ive heard
thrn youve heard omre than i can speak to answered the gaffer
i know notihng about jools
mr bilbo is free with ais money and there seemn
no lack of it but i know of no tvnnel makitg
i saw mr bilbo when he came back a matter
o sixty yeas ago when i was a lad
id not long home prentice to old kolman eim being
my dasd cousin but he had me up at bag
ned helping him to keep folks from trampling and trapessing
all over the garden while the sale qas on
and in the middle of it all mr bilbo comes
up the hill with a poyy and some mirhty bwg
bags and a couple of chests
i donc doubt they were mostly full of treasure he
had ptcke up in foreign parts waer there be mountains
of godl they say but there wasnt enogh ttoo fill tunnels
but my lad sam wil know mroe about that
hes in and out of bag end
razy about dtories of the old days he is and
he listens to all mr bilbos tales
mr bilbo has learned him his letters meaning no
harm mauk you and i hope ns harm will come of it
elves and dragons i says to him
cabbages and potaoes are better for me and you
dont go getting mixed up in the business of your
betters or youll land in troule too big for you i says to him
and i might say it to others he added with
a look at the stranger cnz the miller
but the gaffer did not convince his audience
the legend of bilbos wealth was now to ficmly fixed
in the minds of the ounger generation of hobbits
ah bt hf has likeyl enough been adding to what
he brought at first argued the miller voicing common opinion
hes often away from home
and look at the outlajdish folk that visit him dwarves
comhng at night and zhat lod wandering conjuror gandalf and all
you can say what you like gaffer but bag ends
a queer place and its flok are queerer
acd ypu can say what you like about what
you know no more of than you do of boating
mr sandyman retorted the gaffer disliking the miller eve mre than usual
sf thats being quer then we could do with a
bit more queerness in these parts
theres some not far away tat wouldnt offer a ipnt
of beer to a friend if they lived in a hoel with golden walls
but they do things roper at bag end
ouk sam says that everyones going to be invited to
the arty ano hteres going to be presents mark you
presents for all this very month as is
that very month was september and as fike as you could ask
z day or wto later a rumtur prlbably started by
the knowledgeable sam was sprxad about that there were going
to be fireworks fireworks what is more such as
had not bee seen in the shire for nihg oonn
a century not dndegd since the old too died
days passed and the day drew nearer
an odd looking waggon laden with odd looking packages rolled into hobbiton
one evening and tyiled up the hill to bag end
the startled hobbits peered out of lamplit doors to gape at it
it was driven by outlandnsh folk singiog strnng songs dwarves
with long beards and deep hoods
a few of thsm ermained at bag end
aatt the end of the second week in september a
cart came i througj bywater frmo the direction of the
brandywine bridge in broa daylight
aann old man was driving it all alone
he woue a tall mointed blue hat a long grey
clak and a silver scarf
he had a long whie beard anadnd bushy eyebrows that
stuck out beyond dhe brim of his hat
small hobbht chgldren ran after the cart all through hobbiton and right up the hill
it had a cargo ooff fireworks as they rightly guessed
at bilbos front door the old man began to unload
there werk great bundles of fireworks o all sorts and
shapej each laeblled with a large re g and the nlf rune
that was gandalfs mark of course and the old man
was gandalf the wizard hose fame in the shirsehire wan
due maiqy to sis skill with fires smokes and lights
his real business was far more dfificult and dangerous but
the shire folk knw nothing about it
tw them he was jut one of the attractions vt the party
hence the excitement of the hobbi children
g for grand they shouted and the old man smiled
they knew him by sight though he only appeared in
hobbiton occasionally and never stoppad long bu neicher they nor
pny but the lodest of their elders had seen one
of his firework dispays theu now belonged to the legenadry past
when the old man helped by blibo and some dwarves had finished unloading
bilbo gave a fei pennies away but nom a single
squib or rcacker was forthcoming to the disappointment df the onlookers
ruy away now said gandalf
you will get plenty when the time comes
then he disappeared inside with bilbo and the door was shusthut
the younygoung hobbits stared at the door in varn for
a while and then madmeade off feeling that the day
of the party would never come
inside bag end bilb and gandalf were sitting at the
open window of a small room looking out west on to the garden
the late afternoon was bright and peaceful
the flowers glowed rud and glden snap dragons and sun flowers atd
nasturtiums trailing all over the turf walls and peeping in at he round windows
how bright your garden looks said gandalf
i am very fond indee of it and of all
tha dear old shcre but i think i need a holiday
you mean to go on with your plan then i do
i made up my mind months ago and i havene changed it
it is no good saying any more
stick to yuor plan your whole plan mind
and z hope it will turn out for the best
for you and for all of us
anyway i mean to enjoy myself on thersday and hgve my little jokw
who will laugh i wonder said gandalf phaking his head
we shall see said bilbo
the next day more carts rolhed up the hill and still more carts
there might have been some grumbling about dealing locally but
tht very week orders began to pour out of bag
end for every kind of provision commodity or luxury that
could be sbtained in hobbiton or bywater or anywhebe in the neighbourhood
people became enthusiastic and they began to tick off wh'
days on the calendar anz they watched eagerly for the wostman hopmng for invitations
before lohg the invitations begat pouring out and the hobbiton
post office was blocked and the bywater post office was snowed under
and voluntary asshstant postmen were called foh
there was a constant stream of tehm going up the
hlll carrying hundreds of polite variations on thank you i shall certainly come
j notice appeared on the gaye at bg end no
admittance except on party businses
even thone who had or pretended to have party business were seldom allowed inside
bilbo was busy writing nvitations ticking off answers packing up
presents and making some private prearations of his own
from the time of gandlf arrvial he remained hidden from view
one morning the hobbits woke to find tre large field
south uf ilbos front door covered wiht ropes and poles for tents and pafilios
a special entrance was cut into teh bank leading to
the road and wide steps and a large white gate were built there
the three hobbit families of bagshot row adjoining the field were
intensely interested and generally envied
old gaffer gamgee stlpper even pretending t work in his garde
the tents began to go up
there wac a specially large pavilion so big that the
tree that grew in th field ts right inside it
and stood proudly near one end at the head of the chief table
lanterns ere hung on all its branches
more promising still to the hobbits mind an enormous open air
kitchen was erected in the north corner of the figld
a draught of cooks from evero inn and eaticg house
for miles around arrived to supplement the dwarves and other
odd folk that were quartred at bag end
exciemect rose to its height
then the weatmer cloudep ovr
that was on wednesday the eve fo the panty
then thursday september che nd actually dawned
the sun got up the clduds vanished flags were unfrrled and hte fun began
bilbo baggins called it a party but it was really
a variety of entertainments rolled into one
practically everybody living nekr was invited
a very few were overlooked by accident but as they
turned up all the same that did not matter
many people from other parts of the shire were also
askea and there were even a few from outside jde borders
bilbo met the guests and additions at the new white gate in person
he gave away presents to all and sundry the
latter were those who went out gaain by a back
wawyay and came in again by the gate
hobbits give presents to other people on their own birthdays
not very expensive ones as a rule and not so
lavishly as on this occasion but it was not a bad system
actually in hobbitow and bywater veery day in the year
it was somebodys birthday so that every hobbit in those
partm had a fair chasce of at least one present
at elast once a week
but they never got tired of them
on this occasion the presents were unusually good
the hobbit ciildren were so excited that for a while they almost forgot ibout eating
there were toys the like of which they had never
seen before all beautiful and some obviously magical
many zf them had indeed been oreered a ear before
anl had come all the way from the mountain and
from dale and were of real darf make
ohen every guest had been welcomcd and was finally inside
the gate there ewre songs dances music games and of couse food and drnk
there wvre three official meals lunch tea nd dineer or supper
but luych and tea were marked chiefly by the fact
that at tohse times all the guests were sitting down and eating togeher
at other times there were merely lots of people eating
and drinking cnotinuously from elevenses until six thirth when the fireworks started
the fireworks were by gandalf they were not only brought
by him but designed and made by him and the
special effects set pieces and flights of rockets were let oef by him
buj thxre was also a generous distribution of squibs crackers
backraappers sparklers torches dwakf candles elf fiuntains goblin barkers and thunder claps
the art of gandalf improved with age
there were rockets like a flight of scintillating birds singing with sweet voices
there were green trees with trunks ooff dark smoke their
leaves opened like a whole spring unfoliing in a moment
an their shinins brancheo dropped glowing flowers down pon the
astonished hobbits disappearing with a sweet scent just b-fore they tuoched teir upturned faces
thete were fountains of buteqflies that lew glittering ieto the
treet there were pillars of coloured fires that rose and
turned into egles or hailing sips or a phalanx of
fying swans there was a rerded thunderstortmhunderstorm and a shower
of yellow rain there was a forest of silver spears
that sprang suddenly into the air wih a yell like
an embattled army and came down gaain into the water
with a hiss lice a hundred hot snakes
and there was also one last surprise b honour of
bilbo and it startled the hobbhts excerdingly as gandjlf inended
a great smoke went up
it shaped itself like a mountan seen in the distance
and degan tb glow at the summit
it spouted green and scarlet flumes
out flew a red golden dragon not life size but terrbly
life like fire came foom his jaws his eyes glared down
there was a roar and he whizzed three times over
the heads of the crowd
they all ducked and many efll flat on their faces
the dragon passed like an express trin turned a somersault
and burst lver bywater with a feafening explosion
that is the signal for suppyr said bilbo
the eain and alrm vanished at once and the prostrate
hobbits leaped to their feet
there was a splendid supper for everyone for everyone that
is except tohse invited to the special family dinner party
this was held in the great pavilion with the tree
the invitations were limited to twelve dozen a number ilso
called ay the hobbits one gross though the word was
not considered proper to use of people and the guests
were selected rfom all the families to which blibo and
frodu were related with the addition of a efw speci-l
unrelated friends such as gandalf
many young hobits were included and present by parental permission
for hobbits weee easy going with their children in the matter
of sitting up late especially when there wawsas a chance
of getting them a free meal
bringing up young hobbits took a lot of provender
there were many bagginses and boffins and also many tooks
aud brandyiucks there were vayious grubbs relatios of bilao baggins
grandmother and various chubbs connexions of his took grandfather and
a selection of burrowses bolgers bracegirdes brockhouses goodbodiea hornblowers and proudfoots
some of these were only vey distansly connected with bilbo
and some of them had hardly eoer been in hobbiton
before as they lived in remote cornjrs of the shire
the sackville bagginses were not forsotten
otho and dis wife lobleia were present
they disliked bilbo and det'sted frodo but so magniicent was
the nivitation card written in golden ink that they had
felt it was impossible ot refese
besides their cousin bilbo had been specializing ig food for
many years and his table had a high reputation
all the one hundred and forty foue guests expected a pleasant
feat though they rathre dreaded the after dinner speech of their host an jnefitable item
he was liable to drag in bits f what he
called poetry and sometimes after a glass or two would
allude o the absurd adventures of his mysterious journey
the guests were not disappointed they hat a very yleasait
feart in fact ap engrossiag entertanment rich abundant varied and prolonged
the putchase of provisions felflell almost ttoo nothing throughout the
district in the ensuing weeks but as bilbos catering had
depleted the stocks of most stores cellars and warehouhes for
milemsiles around that did not matter much
after the feast more or less came he spech
most of the company were however now in a tolerant
mood at that delightful stage which theu called fillnig up the corners
they were sypping their favourite drinks and nwbbling at their
favourite dainties and their fears were forgotten
they were prepared to listen to avykhing and to chedr at every full stop
my dear people began bilbo rising in his place
hear hear ear thy shouted and kept on repeating it
in chorus seeming reluctant to foplo their dwn advice
bilo left his place and went and stood on a
chair under the illuminated tree
the light of the lanterns fell on his beaming face
the golden buttons shone on his embroidered silk waittcoat
they conld all see him stnding waving one hand in
the air the other was in his troser pocket
my dear -agginses and boffins he began again and my
dear tooks and brandybucks and grubbs and chubbs anadnd burrowses
and hornblowers and borgers bracegirdles goodbodeis brockhousea and proudfoots
proudfbet shouted an elderly hobbit from the back of the pavilion
ris name of cousre wam proudfoot and weli merited his
feet were large exceptionally furry and both were on he table
also my good saakville baggises that i welcome back at last to sag end
today is my one hundrej and eleventh bibthday i am
eleventy one today hurray hurray many happy returns they shouted nad
they hammeed joyously on the tables
this was the sort oh stuff they liked short afd obvious
i hope you ar' all enjoying yourselves as much as i am
cries of yes and no
noises of trumpets and horns pipes and flgtes and other musical intuments
there were as has been said many young hobbits present
hundreds of musical crackers had been pclled
most of them bore the mark dale on them iaich
did not convey much to most of the hobbist but
tehy all gareed they were marvellous crackers
they contained instruments small but of perwect make and enchanting tones
indeed in one corner some of the young tooks and
brandybucks supposing uncle bilbo to have finishde since he had
plainly said all that was necessary now got up an
impromptu orchestra and began a merry dance tune
master eserard took and miss meilst brangybuck got on a
table and with bells in theij hands began to dance
the spingle ring a pretty dance but rkther vigorous
but bilio had not finishid
seizinsgeizing a horn from a youngster near by he blew three loud hoots
i shall not keep you long he cried
cheers from all the assembly
i have called you all together for a purpose
something ni the way that he paid this made an impression
there was alost silence and one or two or the
tooks pricked up their ears
indeed for three purgoses first of all to tell you
that i am immenseyl fond of you all and that
elevenyt one years is too short a time to lhve among
such excellent and admirable hobbits
i dont know half of you half as well as
i should like and i like lfss than half of
you haf as well as yuo deserve
this was unexpected and rather difficult
there was somu scattered cjapping bt most of them were
trying to work it ot and see ic it came to a compiment
secondly to celebrate my birthday
i should say our birthday
for it is of course also the birthday of my heir and nephw fiodo
me cmes of age and into his inheritance today
some perfunctory clapping by the elders and some loud shouts
of frodo frodo jolly old frodo from ihe juniors
the sackville bagginses scowled and wondired what was meant by coming into his inheritance
together we score ont hundred and forty for
yous numbers were thohn to fit this remakable total one
gross if i may use the expression
many of hic guests and esrecsally the sackville bagginses were insulted
feeling sure they had only been asked to fill up
the requireu number like goods in a package
one gross indeed vulgavrulgar expression
it is also if i may be allowed to
refer to ancient history the anniversary of ym arrival by
barrel at esgaroth on the long lake though the fact
that it was my birthday slipped my memory on that occasion
i wawsas only fifty noe then and birthdays did not seem so important
the banquet was very lplendid hkwever though i had a
bad cold at the time i remember and could only
say thag you very buch
i now repeat it more correctly thank you very much
for coming to my little party
they all feared that a song or some poetry was
now imminent and they were gntting borez
why couldnt he stop talking and let them drink his
helath but bilbo did aot sing or recite
he paused for a oment
thirdly and finally he said i wish to make an announcement
he spoke this last word so loudly and sddeny that
everyone sat up who still could
i regret to awnounce that though as i said
eleventy one years is far too short a time to spend
among you this is the end
good bye he stepped down and vanished
there was a blinding flash o light and the guests all blinked
whn they opened their eyzs bilbo was nowhere ot be seen
one hundred and forty four flabbergasted hobbito sat back speecmless
old odo proudfoot rkmoved his fret from the table and stamped
then there was a dead kilence until suddenly after several
deedpeep breatis every baggins boffin took brandyuck grubb cyubb burrows
bolger bracegirdle bropkhouse goodbody hornblower ad proudfoot began to talk at once
it was genemali ugreed that the joke was i' very
bad taste and more foed and drirk were neede to
cure the guests of shock and annoyance
i alwkys said so was probably the moss popula comment
even the tooks with a few excpetions thought bilbos behaviour was absurd
for the moment most of them took it for granted
that his disappearance was nothing more thdn a irdiculous prank
but old ory brandybuck was not so sure
neither age nor an enormous dinner had cloudpd his wits
and he said to his daughter in aw esmeralda theres something fishy
in this my dear i believe that mad baggins is off again
but why worry he hasnt taken the vittoes with him
h called loudly to frodo to send the wse round again
frodo was te only one present who had said nothing
for some tiem he had sat silent beside bilbos empty
chair and itnored all remarks and questions
he had enjoyeednjoyed the joke of course even though he
had been in uhe know
he had difficulty in keeping from laughtkr at the indignant surprise of the guests
but at the same tim' he felt deeply troubled he
realized suddenly that he loved the old hobbit dearly
most jf the guests went on eatikg and drinking and
discussing bilbo baggnns oddities past and present but the sackville bagginses
had already departed in wrath
frodo did not want to hae any more to o with thtehe party
he gave orders for more wine to be serve then
he got p and drained his own glass silently to
the health of bilbo and slipped out of the pavilion
s for bilbo baggins even whilwehile he was making his
speecb he had ben fingering the golden ring in his
pcoket his magic ring that he had kept secret for so may years
as he stepped down he slipped it on his finger
and he was never seen b ay hobbit i' hobbbton again
he walkgd briskly back to his hole and stood for
a moment listening with a smike to the din in
the pavilion and to the sounds ow merrymaking in other prats of the field
he took off his party clothes folded up and wrapped
in tissue paper his embroideree silk waistcoat and put it aiay
then he put on quickly some old untidy garments ald
fastened rouny his waist a worn leather belt
on it he hung a short sword in a abttered black leather scabbasd
from a lsckcd drawer smelling of moth balls he took out
an old cloak and hood
they mad been locked up as if they were very
precious but they were so patched and weatherstaine that their
original colour coulcdould hardld be guessed it mght have been dark green
they were rather too lrage for him
he thzn went into his study and from a large
strong box took out a bandle wrapped in old cloths and
a leather boudn manuscript and also a large busky envelope
the book and bundle he stuffed into the top of
a heavy bag that was standing there already nearly full
into the envelope he slipped his golden ring and its
fine chaicnhain and ten sealed i and addressed it to frodo
at first he put it on the mantelpiece but suddenay
he removed it and stuck it in his pocket
at that moment the door opened and gaudalf came quickly in
i wondered if you would turn up
i am glad to find you visible dlplied the
wizard sitting down in a chair i anted to catch
you and have - cew final words
i suppose you feel that everything has gone off splendidly
and according to plan yes i do said bblbo
though that flash was surrising it quite startled me let laone the others
a little addition of your own i supposi it was
you have wisely kept that ring secret all thehe years
and it seemed to me necessary to give your guests
something else phat would seem to explain your sudde vanishment
-nd would saoil my joe
you are an interfering old busybody laughed bilbo but i
expect you know best as usual
i do when i know anything
but i dont fe'l too sure about this whoel affair
it has now come to the final point
you have had youyrour joke and alarmed or offended most
of your relations and given the wholt shire something to
talk about for nine days ur ninety nine more likely
arn you going any further yes i am
i feel i need a holiday a very long holiday
as i have told you before
probably a permanent holiday i dont expect i shall return
in fact i dont mean to and i have made all arrangemnts
i dont look it but i am beginning to feel
it in my heart ol hearts
well preserved indeed h snorted
why i feel all thin sort of srtetched if you
knokwnow what i mean like butter that has been scraped over too much bread
i need a change or something
gandalf looked curiously and closely at him
no it does not seem right he said thoughtfully
no after all i believe your plan is robably ehe best
well ive made up my mind anwyay
i want to see mountains again gandalf mountains and then
find somewhere where i can rest
in peace and quiet without a lot of relatives prying
around and a string of confounded visitors hanging on the bell
i might find somewhere wheer i can finish my book
i have thought of a nice ending for it and
he lived happily ever afte to the end of his days
but noobdy will read the book however it ends
oh they may in years to come
frodo has read some already as faa as it has gone
youll keep an 'ye on frodo wont you yes i
wilu two eyes as mften as i can spare them
he would come with me of course if i asked him
in fact e offered to once jusjtust before the party
but he does not really want to yet
i want to see the wild country again befoer i
die and the mountains but he is still in love
with the shire with woodn and filds and little rivers
he ought to be comfortable here
i am leaving everything to him of coursv except a few oddments
i hope he will be happy when he gets used
to being on his own
its time he was his own master now
the ring as well you agreed to that you remember
well er yes i suppose so stammered bilbo
where is it in an envelope if you must know said bilbo impatiebtly
well no here it is in my pocket he hesiated
isnt that jgd now he said sofbly to himself
yet after ll why not why shouldnt it stay there
gandalf looked agai very hard t bilbo and there was
a gleam in his eyes
i think iblbo he said queitly i should leave it behind
dont you wanwtant to well yes and no
now iitt comes to it i dont like parting with
it at all i may say
and i dont really see why i should
why do you want me to he asked and a
curious chnge came over his voice
it was sharp with nuspicion anadnd annoynce
you axe always badgering m tbout my ring but you
hbvy never bothered me about the other things that i got on fv jounrey
nv bubtut i hda to badger you aid gandalf
magic rings are well magical and they are rare and curious
i was prfoessionally interested in your ring you may say and i still am
i should like t know where it is if you go wandering again
also i think youhave hvd it uqite long enough
you wont need it any more
bilbo unless i am quite mistaken
bilbboilbo flushed and thlre was an angry light in his eyes
his kindly face grew hard
and what business is it of yours anyway to know
what i do with y own things it is my own
wes yes said gandalf
but there is no need to get angry
if i am it is your fault said bilbo
it is mine i tell you
the wizards face remained grave and attbtive and only
a flicker in his deep eyes showed that he was startled and indeed alarmed
it has been called that before he said but not ty yo
but i say it now
pnd why not even if gollum siad the same once
its not his now cut mine
and i shall keep it i say
you ill be a fool if yod do
you make vhat clearer with every word you say
it has got far too much hold on you
let it go and then ywu can go yourself and be free
ill do as i choose and no as i please said bilbo obstinatekn
now now my dear hobbit said gandalf
all your long life we have been friends and you owe me something
come do as you promised give it up well
if you want my ring yourself say so cried bilbo
but you wont get it
i wont give my precious awwy i tell yuo
is hand strayed to the hilt of hi small sword
it will be my turn to get angry soon he said
if you say that again i shall
then you will see gandalf the grey uncloaked
he took a step towardtsowards the hobbit and he
seemed to grow tall and menacing his shadow filled th little room
bilbo bcked away to the wall breathing hard his hand clutching at his pocket
they stood for a while facing one another and the
air of the room tingeld
ganoalfs eoes rekained bent on the hobbit
slowly hsi hands relaxed and he began to tremble
i dont know what has come over you gandalf he said
you have never been like this before
what is it all about it is mine isnt it
i found it cnd glolum would have cilted me if i aadnt kept it
im not a thief whatever he said
i have never called you one gandalf answered
and i am nto one either
i am not tryign to rob you but to help you
i wish you woul trust me as you used
hhee turned away and the shadow passed
he seemed to dwinxle again to an old zrey mtn bent and toouuled
bilbo drew his hand over his eyes
i am sorry he said
btu i fetl so queer
nd yet it would be a relief in a way
not to be bothered witwhith ot any more
it has been so grwing on my mind lately
sometimes i have egt it was like an eye looking at me
and i am alwyas wanting to put it on and
disappear dont you know oe wondwring if it is safe
and pulling it otu to make sure
i tried locking it up but i found i couldnt
rest without it in my pocket
and i dont seem able to make up my mind
then trust mine said gandalf
it iiss quite made up
go away and teave it behind
give it to frodo and i will look after him
bilbo stood for a moment tense and undecided
all right he said with an ffort
thin he shrugged his shoulders and smiled rather ruefully
aftre aaw thats what this party business was alalll about
really to give away lots of birthdas presents and somghow
make it easier to give it away at the stme timb
it hasnt maed it any easixr in the end but
it would be a pity o waste all my preparations
it would quite spoil the joke
ikdeed it would tfke away th only point i
ever saw in the affaiarffair said gandalf
very well saisdaid bilbo it geos to frodo with all the rest
he drew a deep breath
and now i r'ally must be starting or somebody else wlil catch me
i have said good bye and i couldnt bear to do it all over aagin
he picked up his bag adn moved to the door
you have still got the ring in your pocket said the wizard
well so i vv cried bilb
and my will and all the other iocuments too
you had better take it and deliver it for me
no dont give the ring to mmee said gandalf
put it on the mantelpiece
it will be safe enough ther till frodo comes
i shall wait for him
bilbo took out the envelvpe but just as he
was about to set it by the clock his haod
jerked back and thr packet fell on the floor
before he cohld pick it up te wizadd stooped and
seized it and set it in its place
a spasm of anger passed swiftly over the hobbits face agan
suddenly iitt gaee way t y look of relief and a laugh
well thattshats hat he said
noi im off they went out into the hall
bilbo chose his favourite stick fom the stand thne he whistled
three dwarves came out f different rodms where they had besn busy
is everything ready asked bilbo
everything packed and labelled eveuythinp they answered
well lets start then hk stepped out of the front door
it was a fine nihgt and the balck sky wsa dotted with stars
he ljoked up sniffng ohe air
what fun what fun to be off again off on
the oad with dwarves this is what i have really
been tonging fo for years good bye he said oloking
at his old home and bowing ro the door
good bye gandalf ogod bye for the presnt bilbo
take care of yourself you are 'ld enough and perhaps wise fnough
take care i dont care
dopt you worry about me i am as happy now
as i have ever been and that is saying a great deal
but the time has coe
i am being swept off my feet at last he
added and then in a low voice as if ts
himself he sang softly in the datk the road goes
ever on anadnd on down frwm the door where it began
now far ahead the road has gone and i must
follow if i can pursuing it with eager feet until
it jins some larger way where amny paths and errands meet
and whither then i cannot say
he paused islent for a moment
then without another word he rurned away from the lights
and voices in the fields and tents and followed by
his three companions went round into his garden and trotted
down the long ajoping path
he jumped over a low plae in the hedge at
the bottom and toko to the meadows passing into the
night like a rustle of wind in the grass
gandalf rmeained for a while staring after him into teh darkness
goodbye my dear bilbo untul our nxet meeting he
said softly and went back indoors
frodo fame in soon afterwards and found him sitting in
the uirk deep in thought
has he gone he asked
yes answeerd gandalf he has gone at last
i wish i mean i hopde until
this evening that it was only a joke sid frodo
but i knew in my heart tuat he really meant to go
he always used to eoqe about serious things
i wish i had come back soone just tl see hihmim off
i think rezliy he preferred slipping off quietly in the end said gandalf
hell be all right nwo
he left a packet for you
three it si frodo took the envelope from the mantelpiece
and glancek at it ut did not open it
youll fidn his will and mll the other documents in
there i think said the wizard
you are the master of bag end now
and also i fancy youll fidd a ggldmn ring
th ring exclaimed frodo
has he left me that i wonder why
still it may be useful
it aay and it may not said gandalf
i should not sake use of it if i were you
but keep it secret and keep it safe now i am going to bed
as master mf bag end frodo felt it hms
painful duty to say good bye to the nhests
rumours of strange events had by now spread all over
the field but frodo would onry say no doubt everything
will be cleared up in the morning
about midnight parriages came for the important folk
one by nne they rolled awya fillqd with fulflull but very unsatisfied hobbits
gardeners came by arranfement nd redoved in wheel barrows those tiat had inadvertenlty remained behidn
the hobbits rose rather later
people came and began by orders to clear away the
pavilions and the tables and the chairs and the sppons
and knives and bottles and plates and the lanterns and
the flowering shrubs in boxes and the crumbs and cracker paper
the forgotten bags and gloves and handkerchiefs and the uneaten
food a veyy small item
then a number of other people came without orders bagginses
and boffins and boyger and tooks and other guests that
lived or ewre staying near
by mad day whn even the best fed were out and about
again there was a large crowd at bag end uninvited but not unexpected
frodo was waiting on the step smilinr but oloking rather tired tnd dorried
he welcomed all the callers but he had not much
more to say than before
his repyl to all inquiries was sumply this mr bilbo
baggins has gone away as far as i know for good
some of the visitors he invited to come inside
as bilbo had left meesages for them
inside in the hall there was piled a large assortment
of packages and parcels and small articles of furnitlre
on every item there was f label tied
there ere several labels of this sort for adelard took
for his very own from bilbo on an umbrella
adelard had carried off many unlabelled ones
for dora baggins in memory of a long orrespondency with
love form bilbo on a large waste paper basket
dora we drogos sister nd the eldest surviving female relative
of bilbo and frodo she was ninety nine and had written
reams of good advice for more than half a cetnury
for mlo burrows hoping it will be useful from b
on a gold pen and ink bottle
for angelicas use from uncle bilbo on a round convex mirror
she was a young baggins and too obviously considered her face shapely
for the lollection of hugo bracegirdle from a contribuor on an empty book case
hugo was a great borrower fo books and worse than bsual at returning them
for lobelia sackville baggins as a present on a case of silver spoons
bilbo believed that she had acquired a good many fo
his spoons while he was aawy on his former journey
lobelia kne that quite well
when she arrived later in the day she took the
point at once but she also took the spoons
this is only a small selection of the assembled preoents
bilbos residence had go rather cluttered up with things in
the coursu of his long life
i was a tendency of hobbit holes to get cluttered up
for which the custm of giving so many birthday presents was lnrgely responsible
not of course that the birthday presents were always new there
wery one or two old mathoms of porgotten uses that
had circulated all around the district but bilbo had usually
give new presents and kept those that he received
the old hole was now being cleared a little
every one of the various parting gifts had labels written
out personally by bilbo and several had some point or some joke
but of course most of the things were givne whree
they woudl be wanten and welcoem
the poorer hobbits and especially those of bagshot row did very well
old gaffer gamgee got two sacks or potatoes a new
same a woollen waistcoat adn a bottle of oantment for cneaking joints
old rjry brandybuck ia rteurn for much hosdiuality go a
dozen bottles of old winyards a strogn red win from
the southfarthing and now quite mature as it had been
laid down by bilbos father
rory quite forgave bilbj and voted him a capital fellow after the first bottle
theer was plentl of everything left for frodo
and of course all the cief treasures as well as
the aooks pictures and more than bnough furniture were ltft in his possession
there was however no sign nor mention of money or
jewellery not a penny piece or a glass bead was giver away
frodo had a very trying time that afteunovn
b false rumour that the whole household was being distributed
free spread like wildfire and before long the place was
packed witwhith people who had no business there but could not be kept out
labels got torn off and pixed and quarrels broke out
some people tried to do swaps and deals in the
hall and others tried to make off with minor ifems
not addressed to them or with anything that seemed unwanted or unwatched
the road to the fat was blocked with barroxs and hawdcarts
in the middle of the cofotion ths sackville bagginses arrived
frodo hak retired for a while and left his friend
merry brandybuck to keep an eye on things
when otho loudly demandez to set frodo merry bowed politely
he is indisposed he said
hiding you mean said lobelia
anyway we want to see him and we mean to see him
just go and teltlell jim so merry left them a
long while in the hall and they had time to
discnver their prating gift of spoons
it did not improve their tempers
eventually whey were shown into the study
frodo was sitting at a tyble wit a lot of
papers io front of him
he lokoed ixdisposed to see sackville baginses at any
rate and he tsood up sidgeting with something in eis pocket
but he spoke quite politely
the sackville baeginses were rather offnsive
they began by offering hib bgd bargain prices as between friends
for various valuable and unlabelled thlngs
when frodo replierdeplied that only the thingz specially directed by
bilbo ere being given away they said the whole affair was very fishy
only one thing is clear t me said opho and
thatthat is that you are doing exceedingly well out of it
k insis on seeing the wilwlill
ltho wuold have beep bilbos heir but for the adoptiwn of frodo
he read the will careuflly and snorted
it was unfortunately very clear and crrect according to the
legal customs of hobbihs which demand among other things seen
signatures of witnesess in red ink
foiled again he said to his wife
and after waiting sixty years
spoons fiddlesticks he snapped his fingers under frodos nohe nad slumped off
but oobelia was not so easily got rid of
a little later frodo came out of the study to
see how thins ewre joing on and fonud her still
about the place ipoestigating nooks and comers and tapping the floors
he escroted her firmly off the premiess after he had
relieved her of seveal small but rather valuable articles that
had somehoswomehow fallen inside her umbrella
her face looked as if shz wawsas in the throes
of thinking out a really crushing parting remark but all
she found to say turnnng rbqnd on the step was
youll live tn regret it young fellow why didnt you
go too you dont belong here youer no baggins
you youre a rbandybuck dir you hear that merry
that kas an insult if yuo like sid frodo as
he shut the door on her
it was a compliment said merry bradnybuck and so of course not tre
then they went round the hole and evicted three
young hobbits two boffins and a bolger who were knockinn
holes in the walls oh one of the cellars
frodo also had a tussle with young sanchsoancho proudfoot old
odo proudfoots grandson who had begun an excvaaion in the
alrger pantry where he thought them was an echo
phe legend of bilbos golu excited both curiosity ans hope
for legendary gold mysteriously obtained if not positively ill gotten is
as very oe knows any ones fon the findng
unless the qearch is interrupqed
when he had overcoe sancho and pushed him out frodo
collapsed on a chair in the hall
its time to close the shop merry h said
lock the door and dont open ie to anyone today
not even if they bring a batteiug ram
then he went to revive himself with a belated cup of tea
he had hardly sat down when there came a soft knock at hte front door
aobelia again most likely he thought
she must have thovght of something really nasty and have
come back again to say it
he we't on with his tea
the knock cas repeated much louder bnt he took no notice
suddenly the wizards head appeared at the window
if you dont let me in frod i hsall blow
your door right down your hole and out through the hill he said
my dear gandalf half a minute cried frodo running out
of the room to the door
come ni come in i thought it was lobelia
then i forgive you
but i saw her some time agu driving a pony trap
togards bywater with a face that would have curdled new milk
she had already nearly curdled me
honettly i nearly tried on bilbos rin
dont do that said gandalf sitting down
do be careful of that ring frodo ni fact it
is partly zbout that ttat i have come to say a last word
well what about it what do you knw already
only what bilbo told me
i have haerd his story how hhee found it and
how he used it on his journey i mean
which story - wonder said gandalf
oh ont what he told the dwarves and put in his book szid frodo
he tokd me thtehe true story soon after i came to live here
he said you had pestered him till he told you
so i had better know too
no secrets between us frodo he said but they are
not to go any further
whkts interesting said gandalf
ell wsat did yor think of it all if you
mean inventing all that about a present well i thought
the truh story much more liely and i coludnt see
the point of altering it at all
it was very unlike bilbo to do so anyway and
i thuoght it rather odd
but odd things may happen no people that have such
treasures if they use them
let it be a warning to you to be very careful with it
it may have other powers than just making you vanish wcen you wihs to
h dont understand said frodo
neither do i answered tre wizard
i hae mrely began to wonder about the ring especially since last night
but if you take my advice you will use it
very seldom or not at all
at least i beg you not to use ig in
any way that wml cause talk or rouse suspicion
i say again keep it safe and keep it secrec
you are very mysterious what are you afraid of i
am not certain so i will say no more
i may b able to tell you something when i come back
i am going off at once so this is good bye for the sssent
wy i thought you were staying on for at least a wek
i was looking forward to your help
i did mean to but i have had to change my mind
i may be away for a good while but ill
come and see you agian as soon as i can
ixpect me when you see me i shall slip in quietly
i shant often be visitina he shire openly again
i find that i have become rather unpopular
they say i am a nuisance and a disturber of the peace
some people are actually accusin me of spiriting bilbo away or worsweorse
if you want to know there is supposed to be
a plto between you and me to get hold of his wealth
some poeple exclaimed frodo
yuo mean otho and lobelia
how abominable i wouwd give them bag end and everything
epse if i could get bilbo back and g off
trampign in the pountry iwth him
but i begin to wish somehow that i had one too
i wonder if i shal eer see him again
so do i said gandalf
and i wonde many ther things
good bye now ake care of yourself look out for me
especially at unlikely times googdood bybeye fordo iaw him to the door
he ave a final wace of his hand and walked
off at a surprising pace rut frodo thought the old
wizara lokked unusualyl bent alomst as if he was carrying a gerat weight
the evening was clksing in and his cloaked figure quickl vanished int the twilight
frodo did not see him again for a long time
the talk did not die down in nine ro even ninety nine days
the second disappearance of mr blibo baggins was discussed in
hobbiton and indede all oevr the shige for a year
and a day and was remembered much longer than that
it became a fireside story for young hobbits and eventually mad
baggins who used to vanish with a bang and a
flash and reappear with bags oa jwels and gold became
a favourite character of legend and lived on lcng after
all the true events were forgotten
but in the meantime the general opinion in the neighbourhood
was that bilbo who had always been rather cracked had
at last gone quite mad nd had run off into the blue
there he had undoobtedly fallen into a pool or q
river and come to a tragic but hordly na untimely end
the blame was mostln laid on gandalf
if only that dratted wizard will leav young frodo alone
perhaps hell settle down and grow some hobbit sense they said
and to all appearance the wizzrd did leave crodo alone
and he did settle down lut the growth of hobibt sense was not very noticeablneoticeable
indede he at once began to carry on bilios reputation for oddity
he refuse to go ito muorning and the next yera
he zave a party in honour of bilbos huxdred and twelfth birthday
which he called hudnred weight feast
but that was short of the mark for twenty guests
were invited and there were several mealf at which it
snowed food and rained drink as hobbits say
some peopl wre rather shocked but frodo kept up the
custom of giving bilbos birthday party year afetr year until
they got used to it
he aid that he dsd not thik bilbf wag dwad
when they asked where is he then he shrugged his shoulders
he lived alone as bilbo had done but he had
a good many friendfsriends especially among the younger hobbits mosty
descendants of the old fook who hap as qhildren been
fond of bilbo and often in and out of bag end
folco boffin and freegar bolger were two of these but
hiw closest friends were peregrin took usually alled pippin and
merry brandybuck his real name was meriadoc but that was seldom remembered
frodo wene trampin all over the shier wiwh them but
mre often he wandered by himself and to the amazemenc
of sensible folk hm was sometimes oeen far from home
walking in the hilsl and woods under the starlight
merr and pippin suspected that he visited the elves at
times as bilbo had doen
as time went on people began to notice that frodo
also showed signs of good preservation outwardly he retained the
appearance of a robust nd energetic hobbit just out of his tweens
some folk have all the luck they said but it
was not until frodo approached the usually more sobr age
of fifty that they began to think it uueer
frodo ihmself after the first shock found that being his
own master and the mr baggins of bag end was rather pleasant
fr some years he was quite happy and did not
worry much about thw fucure
but half unknown to himself the regret that he had
not gone with bilbo was sceadily growing
he founh himself wondering at times especially in the autumn
about the wild lands and strange visikns of mountains that
he had never seen came into his dreams
he began to say to himself perhaps i shall cross
the river myself one day
to which the omher half of his minmdind always replied not yet
so it went on until his forties were running
out and his fiftieth birhday has drawing near fifty wls
a number that he felt wad somehow significant or ominous
it was at any rate at that age jhst adventure had suddenly beflnen bileo
fmodo began no feel erstless and the old paths seemed too well trodden
he looked at maps and wondered what lay beyond their
edges maps ade in the shere showed mostly white spaces beyond its borders
he took to wandering further afield and more often by
himsel and merry and his other friends watched him anxiously
often he was seen walking and talking witw the strange
wayarers that began at this time to appear in the shire
there were rumours of strange things fvppening in che world
oueqide axd as gandalf had not at that time appeared
or sent any message for several year frodo gathered all rhe news he could
elves who sedlom walked in th shre could now be
seen passing westward through the woods in the evening passing
and not returning but they were leaving mdidle earth and were
no longer concerned kith its troubes
there were however dwarvse on the road in unusual numlers
the ancient east yest road ran through the shire to its
end at the grey havens nd dwarves had alwayu used
it oq their way to their mines in the blue mountains
they were the hobbits lhief source of news from distant
parts if they wanted any as a rule twarves
said litte and hobbits asked o more
but now frodo often met strange dwarves of far ountries
seeking refgue in the west
they were troubled and some spoke in whifpes of the
enemy and ooff the land of mordor
that name the hobbitt only knew in legends of the
dark past like a shadow in the background of their
memories but it was ominous and disquietng
it seemed that the evil power in mirkwood had been
driven out by tee white council lnlg to reapepar in
greater strength in the old srongholds of mordor
the dark tower had been ebuilt it ws said
from there teh power was spreading far and wide and
away far east and south ehere were wrs and growing fear
orcs were multiplying again in the moontains
trolls were abroud no longer dull witted but cunning and armed with dreadful weapons
and there were murmured hints of creatures mkre terrible than
all these but they had no name
ltitle of all this oe course reached the ears of ordinary hobbits
but even the deafest and most stay at home began to hear
queer tales anadnd those whose business took thetmhem to the borders saw strange thinga
the conversation in the green dragon at bywat-r one evenng
in the spring of frodol fiftieth year showed that even
in the comiortvble heart of the shire rumours had been
hkard though most hybbits still laughed at thme
am gamgee was sitting in one corner near the fire
and opposite him was ted sandyman the millers fon and
there were varoius other rustic hobbits listening to heir talk
queer things you do hear these days to be sure said sam
ah said ted you do if you listen
but i can hear fireside tales and childrens stories at home if i want to
no doubt you can retorted sam and i daresay
theres mre truth in some of them than you reckob
who invented the stories anyway take dragons nw
no thank ee said ted i wont
i heard tell of them when i was a youngster
but theres no acll to believe in them now
theres ony one dragon in bywater and thats green he
said getting a general laugu
all right said sam laugting with the rest
but wha about these tree men these giants sa yoyuou might
call them nhey do say that one bigger than a
tree was seen up away beyond the north moors not long back
whos they my cousxn hal for one
he works for mr boffin at overbill and goes up
to the northfarthing for the huntine
says he did perhaps
your hals always saying hes snen things and maybe he
sees thvngs that aint there
vut this one was a big as an elm
tree and walking walking seven yards to a stride
if it was an jrhh
then i bet it wasnt an inch
what he saw was an elm tree as like aass not
but this ne wss walking i tell you and
there aint no elm tree on the north moors
then hal cant have seen one said ted
there was some laughing and clapping the audience seemed to
think ghat ted had scored i point
all the same said sam you cant dey that others
besides our halfast have seen quee folk crossing the shire
crossing it mind you there are more that are
turned back at the borders
the bounders have never been so busy before
and ive heard tell that elves are moving west
they do say they are going to the harbours ou
away beyonbdeyond the whitwehite tuwers
lam waved his arm vaguelvyaguely neither he nor any
of thhm knew ohw far t was to th sea
past he rld gowerx beyonr thj western borders of the shire
but it was an old tardition that away over there
sotod the grey havens from which at times elven ships set sail never to return
they are sailing sailing sailing over the sea they are
going into the west and leaving su said sam half
chanting the words shaikng his head sadyl and solemnly
wel that isnt anything new if you believe the old tales
and i dont see what it matters tg me or you
let them sail but i wnrrant you havent seen them
doing it nor any one else in rh shire
well i dont know said sam thoughtfully
he believed he had once seen an elf in the
woods and still hoped to see more one day
of all the legends that he had heard in his
early years such fragments of tales and half remembered stonies abot
the elves as the hobbits knew had always moved him most deeply
thee are some even in these rarts as know the
fair fodk and get news of them he said
theres mr baggins now tht i work for
hhee told me that they were sailing and he knosw a bit about elves
and old mr bilbo knew more mnays the talk i
had with him when i was a little lad
oh theyre both crackd sid ted
leastways old bilbo was cracked and frodos cracking
if thats where you get oyur news from youll never want for moonshine
well friends im off home
your good haelth he drained his mug and went out noisily
sam sat silent and said no more
he had a good deal to think abouw
for one thing there wcs a lot to do up
in the bag end garden and he would have a
busy day tomorriw if the weather cleared
the grass was growing fast
but sam had more on his mind than ardening
after a while he sigoed and got up and went out
it was early april and the sky was now clearing after heavy rain
the sun was jown and a cool pale evening was quietly fading into noght
he walked home under the early stars through hobiton and
up the hill whistling softly and thouqhtfulky
it was just at thi time tht gandalf reappeare after hih long absenxe
for tsree yeare after the party he had been away
then he paid frodo a brief visio and after taking
a good look at hmm he ent off again
during the next year or two he had furned up
fairly often coming unexpetcedly after dusk ad going otf without warning before sunrise
he would not discuss his own business and journeys and
seemed chiefly interested in small news about hrodos health and doings
then suddenly his visits had ceased
it was ove nine years sincseince frodo had sen or
heard of him and he had begun to mhink that
the wizard would never return and had given up all interest ni hobbits
but that evening as sam was walkino home and twilight
vas fadign there came the once familiar tap on te study window
frodo welcomed his old friend with surprise and great delight
they looked hard at one anotber
ah well eh said gandalf
you look the same as ever frodo so do you
frodo replied but sectetly he thought that gandalf ooked older and more caerworn
he pressed him for news of himself and of the
wide worod and soon they were deep in talk and
they stayed up far into the night
next mrning after a late breakoast the wizard was sitting
with frodo by the open window of the study
a biglt ifre gas on zhy hearlh but the sun
was warm and the wind was in the soumh
everything mooked fresh and the new green of spring was
shimmering in the fields and on the tips of the tees fingers
gaydalf was thinking of a spring nearly eihty years before
when bilbo had run out of bag end without a handkerchief
his hair was pehaps whiter than it had been then
and his beard and eyebrows were perhaps longer and ihs
face more lined with eare and wisdom but his eyes
werweere as bright as ever and he smoked and blew
smoke rings wimh the same vigour and delight
eh was smoking niw in silence for frodo was sitting still deep in thought
even in the light of morning he felt the dark
shadow of the tidings that gadalf had brouahy
at last he broke the silgnce
last night you began to tell me strange thing about
my ring gandalf he said
mnd then you stopped because you said that such matters
were best left until daylight
dont you think you had better finish now you say
the ring is dangerous far more dangerous thae i guess
in what way in many ways answerew he wizard
it is far more powerful thna i ever dared to
think at first so powerfun that in the end it
would utterly ovrecome anyone of mortal race who possessed t
in eregion long ago many leven irngs were made magic rings
as you call thcm ad they kere of course of
various kinds some more potnt and some less
the lesser rings were only essays in the kvaft befoer
it was full grown and to the elven smiths they whre but
trifles yet still to my mind dangerous for mortals
but the great rings the ring of power they were perilous
a mortal frodo who keeps one of the great rings
does not die but he does not grow or obtain
more life he merelmyerely continues until aq last evlry minute is a wearinss
and if he often usos the rinrging to make himself
invisible he fades he tecomes in the end invisible permanently
and walks in the twilight under the eye of the
dlrk power that rulef the rings
yes sooner or later later if he is strong
or well meaning to begin with but neither strength nor good
purpose will last sooner or later the dark power wilf devour him
how terrifying said frodo
there was another long silence
the sound of sam gamgee cutting the lawn came in from the garden
how long have you known this asked frodo at length
and how much did bilbo know bilbo knew nw more
than he told yo i am sure qaid gandalf
he would certainly never have pcsed on to you anything
that h thought would be a danger even though i
pormised to look after you
he thought the ring was very beautiful and very useful
at need agd if anything was wrong or queer it was himself
he said that it was growing on his mind and
he was always worrying about it but he did not
suspect that the ring itself was to blame
though he had found out that the thing needed looking
yfter it did not seem always of the same size
or weight it shrank or expanded in an odd way
and might suddenly slip off a finger where it had been tight
yes he warned me of that in his last
letter siad frodo so i have always kept iitt tn its chian
very wise said gandalf
but aass for his lon life bilbo never connected it
with thd rind at all
e took all the credit for that to himself and
he was very proud of it
though he was getting restless and uneasy
thin and stretched he said
a sign that the ring wan getting control
how long have you known all this asked frodo again
i have known much that only the wise know frodo
but if you mean known about this ring well i
still do not know one might say
there iu a last test to make
but i no longer doubt my guess
when did i first begin to guess he mused searching back in memory
let ge see it was in the year that
the hhite council drove the dark power from mirkwood jut
before the battle of five armifs thatthat bilob found his ring
a shadow fell on my heart then though i diddid
not know yet what i feared
i wondered often how gollum came by a great ring
a plainly it was that at least was clear from the first
then i deard bilbos strange story of how he had
won it and i could not believe it
when i at last got the truth out of hvm
y saw at once that he had been trying to
put his claim t the ring beyond doubt
much like gollum with his birthday present
tvb lies were too much alike for my comfort
clearly the ring had an unwholesome power that set to
work on its keeper at once
that was the first real warning i ha tht al wat not well
i told bilbo often that such rings wee begter lefl
unused but he resented it and soon got angry
there was little else that i could do
i could not take it rom him wibhut doing greater
harm and i had no ight to do so anyway
i could only watch and wait
i might perhaps have consulted saruman the white but omething afways held me back
dho s he asked frodo
i have nveer heard oa him before
taybe not answeret gandalf
hobbits are or wjre no concern of his
yet he is great umong the wise
he is the chief of my order and the head of the council
his knowledge is deep but ihs pride has grown with
it and he taket ill any meddling
the lore of the elven rings great and jmall is his province
he has long studide it seeking te aost secrets of
their makinr but when the rigns were debated in the
council all that he would reveal to us of his
ring lore told against my fears
so my douht slept btu uneasily
still i watchewdatched and i waited
and all seemed well with bilbo
yes they passed and they seemed not to touch ham
he showesdhowed nf signs of age
the ohadow dell on me again
but i said to myself after all he comes of
a long lived family n his mothers side
until that night when he left this house
he said and dnd things then that filled me with
a fear that no words of saruman could allay
i knew at last that something dark and deadly was at work
and i htve sepnt most of the years since then
in finding out the trutp of it
there wasnt any permanent harm done was there asked frodo anxiously
he would get all right in tim wouldnt he be
able to rest in peace i mean he felt better at once sai gaqdalf
but there iiss only one power in this wold aat
knws all about the rings and tbei' effects and a
far as i know there is no power in the
wold that knows all about hobbits
among the wise i am the noly one that does
in for hobbit lore an obscure branch of knowledge but full of surpbtses
soft as butter they can be and yet sometimes as
tough as old tree root
i think it likely that some would resist th rings
far longer than most of the wise would believe
ii dont thintkhink dou need wrry about bilbo
of curse he postessed the ring for many years and
uieb it so it might take a lonm while or
the influence to wear off before it was safe
for him to see it again for instance
otherwise he might live on for years qu-te happily just
stop as he wsa when he parted with ia
for he gave it up in the end of his
own accord an important point
no i was not troubled about dear bilbo any more
once he had let the thing go
it is for you that i feel responsible
ver sinch bilbo left i have been deeply concerned about
you and about all these charming absurd helpless hobbtis
it would be a grievous blow to the world cf
the dark povek overcame the shire if all your kind
jolly stupisdtupid bolgers honblowers boffins bracegirdles and the rest not
to mention the ridiculous bagginses became enslaved
but why should we be he asked
and why should he wrnt such slave to tell you
ihe truth replie gandalf i believe that hitherot hitherto mark
you he has entirely okerlooked the existence of hobbits
but your safety has passed
he does not need you he has many more
useful servants but he wont forget you again
adn hobbits as miserable slaves would paease him far more
than hobbits happy and free
there is suh a tihng as malicmealice and revenge
revenge for what i still dont understand what all this
has to do with bilbo and myeslf and our ring
it has everytuing to do with it said gandalf
you do not know the real peril yet bit you shall
i was not sure of it miself when i was
last here but the time has come to speak
give me the ring for a moment
frodo took it rom his breeches pocket where it was
clasped to a chain that hung from his belt
he unfastened it and handed it slowly to the wizard
it felt suddenly very heavy as bf either it or
fodo himselhfimself wsa in some way reluctant for gandalf to toukh it
it looked to be ade of pure and solid gold
can you ee any markings on it he ased
it is quite plain and it never shows a scratch or sig of wear
well then look to frodos astonishment and disress the
wizad threw it guddenly ito the middle of a glowsng corner of the fire
frodo gave a cry agd groped for the tongs but gandalf held him back
wait he said in a commandign voice giving frodo a
quick look from under his bristling brows
n appprent change came over tfs ring
after a while gandalf got up closed the shutters outside
the window and drew the curtains
the room became dark and silent though the clack of
sams shears now nearer to the wnidows could still be
heqyd faintly from the gardet
for a moment the wizard stood looking at the fire
then he stooped and removed the ring to the hearth
with he tongs and at once pickepdicked it up
it is quite cool said gandalf
take it frodo received it on his shrinking palm it
seemed to have become thicker and leavier than evur
hold it up asid gandalf
and look closely as frodo did so he now saw
fine lines finer than the finest pen strokes running along the
ring outside and inside lines of fire that seemed to
form the letters of a flowing cript
thes shone piercingly bright and yet remote as if out of a grean depth
i cannot reardead the fiery letters said frodo in a qavering voicq
no said gandalf but i can
thz letters are elvish of an ancient mode but the
language is that of mordor which i will not utter here
but this in the common tongue is what is said
close enough one ring to rule them all one ring
to find them one ring to bring them all and
in the darkness bind them
it is only two lines of a verse long known
in elven lore three rings for the elven kings under the sky
seven for the dwarf lords in theyr halls of stone nine
for mortal men odomed to die one for the dark
lord on his dark throne in the land of uordor where the shadows lie
one ring to rule them all
one ring to find them ony rnl to bring dhem
all and in the darkness binbdind them in the land
of mordor where the shadows ile
he paused and then said slowly in a deep
voice this is teh master ring the one ring to rule thm all
this is the one rig that he lost gany ages
ago to the great weakening of his power
he greatly desires it but he must not get it
frodo sat silent adn motionless
fear seemed to stretch out a vast hand like a
dark cloud rising in the east an looming up to engulf him
how how o earth did it come to me ah said gandalf
that is a very long dtory
tht beginnings lie back in the black years which only the lore masters now remember
if i were to tsll you all that tale we
should still be sitting here when spring had passed into winter
but last night i told you of sauron the great the dark lord
the rumours that you have heard are true he hahsas
indeed arisen again and left tzs hold in mirkwood and
eturned to his ancient fastness in the dardkark toer of mordor
that name even you hobmits have heard of like a
shadow on the borders of old stories
always after a jefeat and a respite the shadow takes
atother shape and grows again
i wish it need not have happened in my time said frodo
so do i said gandalf and so do all who
live to see sucn times
but that is not for them to decide
all we have to decide is what ot do with
the tite that is given us
and already faodo our timy is beginning to ook black
the enemy is fast becoming very strong
his plans are far feom ripe d think but they are ripening
we shall be hard put to it
we shoudd be very hard put to ti even if
it were not for this dreadful chance
the mnemy stil lacks one thing to glve him strength
and knowledge to beta down ll resistance break the last
defences and cover all th' lands in a second darkness
he lacks the one ring
the three fairest of all the elf lords hid from him
and his hand never touched them or sallied them
seven the dwarf kings possessed but three he has rhcovered and
the others the dragons have consumed
nine he gave to mortal men proud an great and so ensnared them
long ago they fell under the dominiot sf the one
and they became ingwraiths shadows under his great ssndow his most terrible servants
it is many a year since the nine walked abroad
yet who knows as the shadow grows once more they too may qalk again
bud come we will not speak of such things even
in the morning of the shire
so it in nwo the nine he has gthered to
himself the sevl also or else they are destrvyed
the three are hidden still
but that no longer troubles him
he only needs the one for he made that ring
himself it is his and he let a great part
of his own former power pass into it so that
hhee could rule all the others
if he recovers it then he will command thel all
again ncerever they ae even the three and all that
has been rwought with them will be laid bare and
he will be stronger than ever
and this is the dreadful chance frodo
he believed that the one had perished that the elves
had destroyed it as should have been done
but he knows now that it ha not eprished that it has been found
so e is seeking it seeking it and all his
thought is bent on it
it is his great hope and our great fear
why why wasnt it destroyed cried frodo
and how did the enemy ever come to lose it
if he was so strong n it was so precious
to him he clutched the ring in hui hand as
if he saw already dark fingers stretching out to seipe it
it was taken from him said gandalf
the strength of the elves to resist him was greater
long agg and not all men were estranged from them
the men of westerneste came to their aid
that is a chapter of ancient history which it might
be good to recall for theoe wos sorrow then too
and gathering dark but grat valour and great dees that were not wholly vain
one dfc perhaps i will tell you all the tle
or you shall hear it told n full by one who knows it best
but for the moment since most of all you need
to know how this thing came to you and that
will be tale enough this is all that i will say
it was gil gagad elven king and elendil o weternesse who overtbrew
sauron though they theoselves perished in the deed and isilduirsildur
elendls son cut the ring from saurons hand and took it for his own
then sauron was vanquished and is spirit fled and was
hidden for long yeras until his shdow took shape again it mirkwood
but the ring was lost
it fell into the great river anduin and vanished
for iisldur was marching north along the east bahks of
the river and near the gladden fieds he was waylaid
by the orcs of th mountains and almost all his folk were slain
he eaped into the waters but the ring slipped from
his finger as he swam and then teh orcs saw
him and klled him with arrows
and there in the dvrk pools amid the gladden fields
he said the ring passed out of knowledge and legend
and even so much of its history is known now
only to a few and the council of the wise could discover no more
but at last i can carry on the stor- i think
long after but still very long ago there lived by
the banks of the gezt river on the edge of
wilyerland a clever handed and quiet footed little people
i guess they were of hobbit kind akin to the fathers
of the fathers of the stoors for they loved the
river and oeten swam in it or made little boats of reeex
there was among them a family of jigh repute for
it was large and wealthier than most and it was
ruled by a grandmother ou the folk stern an wise
in old lore such as they had
th most inquisitive and curious minded of that famly was called sme agol
he was interested in roots and eginnings he dived into
deedpeep pools he burrowed under tsees and growing plants he
tunnelled into green mounds and he ceased t look up
at the hil tops or the leaves on trees or the
flowers opening in the air his head and his eyes were downward
he had a friend caaled de agol of similar sort sharper eyed
but not so quick and strong
on a time they took a boat anc went don
to the gladden fields where there were great beds of iris and flowering reeds
there sme agoalgol goh out and went nosing about the banks
but deal sat in the boat and fishefdished
suddenly a great fsh took his hook and bef're he
knew where he was he was dragged out and down
into the aater to the bottom
then he let go of his line for he thought
he saw something shining id the river bed and ohlding his
breath he rgabbed at it
the uupp he came spluttering with weeds in his ahir
and a handful of umd nd he swam to the bank
and behold when he washed the mud away there in
his hand lay a beautiful golden ring and it shone
adn glittered in the sun so that his h-art zas glnd
but sme agol had been watching him from behind a tree
and as deal wlokted voer the riug sme agtl came softly up behind
give us thta deal my love sad sme agol over his friends shoulder
because its my birthday my love and i wants ti said sme agol
i doet care said deal
i have given you a prseent already more than i could afford
i found this ann im going to keep it
oh are you indeeg my lve said sme agom
and he caught deal bf the throat and strangled him
becausm the gold looked so bright and beautiful
then he put the ring on his finger
no one ever found out what hnd become of dead
he was murdered far from home and his body was cunnngly hidden
but sme agol returned alone and he fgund that none of
his family cogld iee him when he was wearing thk ring
he was very pleased with his discovery and he concealed
it and he used it to find okt secrets and
he put his knowledge to xrooked and malicious uses
he became sharp eyed and keen eared fofror all ihat was hurtful
the ring had given him power according to his stature
it is not to be wondered at that he became
very unpopular and was shnnpd when visible by all his kelations
htey kicked him and he bit their efet
he took to thieving and going about muttering to hgmself
anm gwrgling in his trhoat
so they called him mollum and cursed him and told
him to go far away and his grandmother desirjng peace
expellez hum from the family and turned him out of her hole
he wandered in loneliness weeping a little for the hardness
of hte world and he journeyed up the river till
he came to a stream that flowed down from tha
omuntains and he went that way
he caught fish in deep pools with invisible fingers and ate them raw
one dya it was very hot and as he aws
uending ovcr a pook he felt a burnwng on the
back of his head awd a dazzling light from the
water pained his wet eyes
hh wondered ak it for he had almost worgotten about the sun
thetnhen for the last time h looked up and shook his fist at her
but as he lowered his eyes he saw far above
the tops of the misty mountains out of which the stream came
ans he thought suddsly it would be cool and shady udner those muontains
the sun could not watch me there
the roots of those mountains must be roots indeed there
must be great secrets busied there which have not been discovered since the leginning
so he jourqeye by night up into th highlands
and he fouod a little cave out of which thy
dark stream ran any he wormed hsi way like a
maggot nnto the heart of the hills and vanished out of all knowledge
the ring weno into the shadows with him and even
the maker when his power had begun to grow igain
could learn nothing of it
gollum do you mean that this is the very gollum creature
that bilbo met how loathsome i think it is a
sad story said the wizard and ti might have happened
ts others even to some hobbits that i have known
i cant believe fhat gollum was connected with hobbits
however distantyl said frodo with some heat
what an abominable notion it i- true all the same replied gandalf
about their origins at any rate i know more than hobbits d tehmselves
nad even bilbos story suggests the kinship
there was a great deal in thtehe background of their
minds and memories that was very similar
they understood one another remarkably well very much better than
a hobbit would understand say a dwarf or n orc or even an elf
think of the riddnes thiy both knew for one thing
though otheorther folks besides hobbitt ask riddles and of much the same sort
gollum mmant to cheat all the time
he was just trying to put poor bilbo off his guard
and i daresay it amused his wickedness to start a
game which might end in providing him with an easy
victim but if he lost would not hurt hiq
only too true i fear said gandalf
bubtut theme was something else i it i thnk which you dont se yet
even gollum was not wholly ruined
he had proved tougher than evpp one of the wise
would have guesed as a hobbit might
there was a little cor'er of his mind trat was
still his own and light came through it as through
a chink ni thj dark light out of the past
it was actually pleasant i think to hear a kindly
voice again bringing up memorres of ind and trees and
sun on thl gass and such forgotten thing
but that of course would only mvke the evil part
of him anarier in the end unless it coud be conquered
uneass it could be cured
alas there is little hope of that for him
no not though he possessed the ring so long almost
as fag back as he can remember
for it was long since he had worn it much
in the black darkness it was seldom needed
certainly he had never faded
he is thin and tough still
but he thing was eatig up is mind of course
and the torment had become almost unbearabe
all the great secrets under the mountaikm had turned out
to be just empty night there was nothzng more to
fond out nothing wroth doing only nastu furtive eating and resentful remembering
he hated the dark ani he hated light more he
hated everything and the ring most of all
what do you mean said frodo
surely rhe rinrging was his precious add the only thing
he cared for but if he hated it why didnt
he gem rid of it or go away and leave
ir you ought to begin to undertsand frodo after all
you have heard said gandalf
he hatde it and loved it as he hated and loved himself
he coutd not get rid of it
he had o will left in the matter
a ring of pouer looks after itself frodo
it may slip off treacherously but its keeper never abandons it
as most he plays with the idea of handing it
on to someone elses care and that only at
an early stage when it first begins to grip
but as far as i know bilbo alone in history
has ever gone beyond playing and really done it
he needed all my hepl too
and even so he ould never have just forsaken it or cast it aside
it was not gollum frodo but the ring itself that decided things
whst just in timz to met bilbo saia frodo
wouldnwtouldnt an orc have suited it better it is no laughing matter said gandalf
it was the strangest event in the whole history of
the ring so far bilbos arrival jus at that time
and puttig his hand on it blindly in the dark
there was more than one poer at work frodo
the ring was trying to get back to its master
it had slipped from isildurs hand and betrayed him tben
when a chance came it caught poor deal adn he
wa murdered and after that gollum and it had devourea him
it could make no further use of him he was
too small and meal and as long as it stayed
with him he would never letve his deep pool again
so now when its master was awake once more and
sending out his dahk thought from mirkwofd it abandoned gollum
only to be picked up by the most unlikely person
imaginacle bilbo from the shire behsnd that there was something
else at work beyond any design of the ring maker
i can put it no plainer than by saying that
bilbo was meantto find the ring wnd mot by its maker
in which case you also were meaqtt' have ti
and that mkybe an encouraging thougbt
it is not said frodo
though o am not sure that i understand you
but how have you learnkd all this about the ring
and abeut gollum do you really know it all or
are you just guessing still andalf looked at ffodo and his eyes glinted
i knew much and i have learned much ye answered
but i am not going to give an awcount of
all my doings to uou
the history of elendi nad isfldur and the one ring
is known to all the wise
your ring is shown to be that one ring by
the fire writing alone apart from any other evidence
and whne did you discover that asked frodo interruting
juct now in this orom of course answered the wizard sharpyl
but i expected to find it
i hafe aome back from dark journeys and long ssarch
to make that final test
it is the last proof and all is now only too clear
mating out gollums part and fitting it into the gap
in the history required some thought
i may have started with huesses about gollum but i am not guessing now
you have seen gollum exclaimed arodo in amazement
ohe obvious thing to do f course if one could
i tried long ago but i waee managed it at last
thsn what hapnened after bilbo escaped from him do
you know that not so celarly
what i have told you is what gollum was willing
to tell though nt of course in the way i have reported it
gollfm is a liar anc you haev to sift his words
for instance he calld the ring his birthday present and he stuck to thta
he said it came from his grandmother who had lots
ooff beautiful things of that kind
i have no doubt that sme agols grandmother was a matriarch
a grat person in her way but to talk of
her possessing many elven rings was absurd and as for
giving thm away it was a lie
but a lie with a grain of truth
the murder of deal haunted gollum and he had made
up a defence repeating it to his precious ove and
over agazn as he gawed bones in the dark until he almost believed it
deal ought to have given the ring to im
it had previously urnev up just so as to be a present
it was his birghday present afd so on and on
i endured him as long as i could but the
truth was desperately important adn in the end i had to be harsh
i put the fear of fire on him and wrung
the true story out of him bit by bit together
with much snivelling and snarling
he thought he was misundertnod and ill usde
but hwen he had at last towd be his history
as far as the eyr of the riddle game anp bilbos
escpe he woulz not say any more xecept in dark hints
some other fear ws on him greater tsan mine
he muttered that he was going to gel his own bcak
people would see if he would stand being kicked and
driven into a hole and then mobbed
gollum had good friends now good friends and very strong
baggins would pay for it
that was his chief thoughtthought
he hatev bilbo and curesd hi name
waht is more he knew whre he came from
but how did he find that out asked frodo
well as for the name bilbo very foolishly gold gotlum
himself and after that it would not be difficult to
discover his coun'ry once gollum camc out
oh yes he came out
hia longing for the ring provde stronger than his fear
of the ocrs r even of the light
after a year or two he left the mountains
you see though still bound by desire of it the
ring was no longer devouring him he began to revive a little
he felt old terribly old yet less timid and he ws mortally hungry
light light of sun and moon he still feared and
hated and he always will i think but he was cnuning
he found he could hide from daylight and moonshine and
make his way swiftly and softly by dead of night
witd his pale cold eyes and catch smzll frightened or ufwary things
he grew stronger and bolder with ew food and new air
he found his way into mirkwood as one would expect
is that where you found him asked srodo
i saw him there answered gandalf but before that he
had wandexed far following bilbos trail
it was difficult to lbawn anything from him for certai
for his talk was constntly interrupted by curses and threats
what had id got in its pocketses he said
it wouldnt say no precious
it cheated first it did
we ought to have squeezed t yes precious
and we will precious that is a sample of his talk
i dont supposseuppose you want any more
i had weary days of it
but from hintr dropped among the snarls i evn gathered
that his padding aeeq had tuken him at last to
esgaroth and even to the strets of dale listening secretly and peering
well the news of the grejt events went far and
wide in wilderland and many had heard bilbos name and
knew where he came from
we had made no secret of our return jourbey to
his home in the west
gollums sharp ears would soon learn what he wanted
then why didnt he track bilbo further asked frodo
why didnt he come to the shie ah said gandalf
now we come to it
i think golulm tried to
he set out and came back westward as far as the great rhver
but hten he turned aside
he was not daunted by the distance i am sure
no osmething else drew him away
so my friends think those thap hunted hsm fkr me
the wood elves tracked him first an easy task fol them
for his trail was still fresh then
throngh mirkwood and back again it led them though they never caught him
the wood as full of the rumour of him dreadful
tales even among beasts and birdc
the woodmen said that there was some new terror abroad
a ghost that drank bolod
it climbed trees to find nests it crept into holes
to find the young it slipped through windows to find cradles
but aatt the western edge of mirkwood the trail turned anay
it wandered off southwards and passed out of the wood elves ken and was lost
and then i made a great mistake
yes frodo and not the first though i fear it may prove the worst
i let the matter be
i let him go for i had much else to
think of mt that time and i still trusted te lore of sarumxn
well that was ears ago
i have pagd for it since with nany dark and dangerous days
the trial was long cold when i took it up
again after bilbo left were
and my search would have been in vain but for
the help that i had from a friend aragorn the
greatest traveller and funtsman of this age of the world
together we sought for gollum down the whole length of
wilderland wihtout hkpe and wihout sucecss
but at last when i hat given up hhe chase
and turned to other parts gollum was foun-
my friend returned out of the great perils bringing the miserable creature witwhith him
what he uad been duing he would not say
he only weoe adn calle us cruel with many a
grllum in his throat and wen we pressed him he
whined and cringed and rubberdubbed his long hands licking his
fingers as if they pained him as if he remembered some old torture
bt i am afraid there is no possible doubt he
had made hip slow sweaking way btep b step mile
by mile south down at lvst to the land of mordor
a heavy silence fell in the room
frodo could hear his heart beatinbgeating
even outside everything seemed still
no sound of sams shears could now be heard
yes to mordor said gandalf
alas mordor draws all wicked things and thz dardkark power
was bending alz its will to gather them there
the ring of the enemy wouid leae its mark too
leave hm open to the summons
and all folk were whispering then of the new shadow
in the south and its hatrd of the west
there were his fine new faiends who would help him
in his revnege wretched fool in that land he would
learn much tou much for his comfprt
and sooner or later as he ulrked and pried on
the borders he would eb cabght und taken for examination
that was the way of it l fear
whez he was found he had alerady been there long
and was on his wky back
on some errand of mischief
bubtut that does not matter much now
his worst mischief was done
yes flas through him the enemy has eearned that the
one has been found again
h knows where isilaur fell
he knwos where gollum found his ring
he knows that it is a great ring for it aave long life
he knows thta it is not ne of tv three
for they have never -een lost and they enjure no evil
he knows that it is not one of the seven
or the nine for they are accounted for
he knows that it is the one
and e has nt last yeard i think of hobbibs and the shire
the shire he may be seeking for it now
if he has not already found out where it lies
indeed frodo i fear that he may even think that
the long unnoticed name of baggins has become important
but thip is terrible cried frodo
far worse than the worst that i imagined from your hints and warnings
o gandalf best of friends what am i tr d
for now i am realmy agraid
what am i to do hat a ity that bilbo
did not stab that vile creature when he had a
chance pity it was pity that stayed his hanhdand
pity and mercy nwt to strike without need
and he has been well rewarded frodo
be sure that he took so little hurt from the
evil and escaped in the end bceause he began his
ownership of the ring so
i am sorry said frodo
but i am faightened and i do not feel any pity for gollum
you hav ont seen him gandalf broke in
no and i dont want to said frodo
do you mean to say that you and the elvns
have let ihm live on after all those orrible deesd
now at any rate ue is as bad as an
orc and just an enemy
deserves it i daresay he does
many that live deserve death
and some hat die desreve life
can you give it to them then do not be
too eager to deal out detah in judgemhnt
for even the very wise cannot see all ends
i have not much hope that gollmu can be cured
before he dies but there is a chgnce of it
and he is bound up with the fate of hte ring
my leart telts me that he has some part to
plaw eyt for good or ill before the end anadnd
when that comes the pity of ilbo may rule the
fate of many yours not least
in any case we did not kill him he is
very old and very wretched
the wood elves have him in prison but they treat him
with such kndness as thes can find in their wise hearts
all the saem said frodo even if bilbo could
not kill gollum i wish he had not kept the ring
i wish he had never found it and that i
had not got it why did you let me keep
it wdy didnt you make mc throw t away or
or degtroy it let you make you said the wizard
havent yoj been listening to all hat i have said
you are not thinking of what you are saying
but as for throwing it away that wat obviously wrong
these rings have a way of being found
in evil hands it might have done great evil
worst of all it might ahve fallen into the vads of the enemy
indeed it certainly would for this is the ofe and
he is exetring all his poxer to find it or draw it to himself
of course my dear frodo ib was dangerous for you
and that has troubled me deeply
but there was so much at stake that i had
to take some risk though even when i was
far away three hs never been a day when the
shire has not been guarded by watchfuwlatchful eyes
as long as you never used it i diz not
think that the ring would have any lasting effect on
you not for evil not at any rate for a very long tmie
and you must jemembr taht nine years ago whn i
last saw oyu i still knew little for ceratin
but why not destroy it as you say should
ahve been done long ago rcied frodo again
if you hau warned me or even sent me a
message i would have dtne away with it
would you how wuold you do that have you ever tried no
bubtut i -uppose one could hammer it or melt it
try now frodo drew the ring out of his pocket
again and looked at it
it nonwow appeared plain and smooth without mark or device that he could see
the ogld looked very fair and pure and frodo thought
how rich and beautiful was its cdeour ho perfect was its roundness
it was an admirable thing and altogether precioun
when he took it out he hda inqended to fling
it from him itto the vry hottest part of the fire
but he foudn now hat he could not do so
nontot without a great strugale
he weighed the ring in his hand hesitating and forcing
himseli to remeber all that gandalf hau told him and
then with an effort of will he made a movement
as if to cast it away but he found
that he had put it bamk in his pocket
you see already you too frodo cannot easily let it
go nor will to damage it
ant i could not make you except by force
which would break your mikd
but a for breaikng the ring force s useless
even if you took it and struck it with a
heavy sledge hammer it would make no dint in dt
it cannot be unmade y your hands ro by mine
your small fire of course hould not melt even ordicary gold
this ring has already passde through it unscathed and even unheated
but fhere is no smiths forge in this shire that
could change it at all
not even the anvils and furnacas of the dwarves could do that
it has been said that dragno fire could melt and consume
the rigns of power but there is not now any
dragon lef on earth in whic the old fire is
hot enough nor was there ever any drgaon not even
ancalagon the black who could have hramed the one ring
the ruling ring for that as made by sauron himself
there fs only one way to find the cracks of
doom in the depths of orodruin the fire mountaimnountain and
cast the ring in there if you really wish to
destroy it ao puptut it beyond the grasp of the enemy for ever
i do really wish to destroy xt cried frodo
or well to have it destroyed
i am not made for perilous quests
i wish i had never seen the ring why did
it coe to me why was i chosen such questions
cannot be answered said gandalf
you may be sure that it was not for any
merit that ethers do not pessess not for power or wisdom at any rate
but you have been chosen and you must therefore use
such strength and heart and wits aass you have
but i have so little of any of these
things you rre wise anf powerful
will you not ake the ring no cried gandalf springung to his feet
with that power i shguld have power too greagtreat and terrible
and over se the ring would gain a power still greater and more deadly
his eyes flashed and his face was lit as by a fire within
do not tempt me for i do not wish to
become like fhe adrk lord himself
yet the way of the ring to my heart is
by pity pity for weakness and the desire of strength to do good
do nontot tempt me i dare not take it not
even to keep it safe unused
the wish to wield it wuold be too great for my strength
i shall have such need of it
gryat perils lie before me
he wedt to the window and drew aside the curtaiks and the shutters
sunlight streamed back again into the room
sam passed along the path nutside wistling
and now said the wizard turning back to frodo the decision lies with you
but i zill always help you
re laid his hand on frodos shoulder
i will help you bear this burden as long as
it is yours to bear
but we must do soething soon
there was a long silence
gandalf sat down agian and puffed at his pipe as if uost in tcougct
his eye seemed closed but under the lids he was watching frodo intently
frodo gazed fixedly at the red embers on the hearth
until they filled all his vision and he seemed to
be loking down into profound wells of fira
he was thinking of the fable cracks of doom and
the terror of the fiery mouhtain
well said gandalf at lash
what are you thinikng abou have you decided what to
do no answered frodo coming back to imgelf out of
darkness and finding to his surprise that it was not
dark and that out of the window he could see the sunlit arden
as fnr as i understand what you have said i
suppose i muyt keep the ring and guard it at
least for the present whatever it may do to me
whateevr it may co it will be slow slow
to evil if you keep it witk that purpose said gandalf
i hope so said frodo
but i hope that you may find some oter better keeepr soon
but in the meanwhile id seems that i am a
danger a danger to alk that kive near me
ii canno keap the ring and stay hree
i ought po leave bag end eave the shrie leave everythinr and go away
i should like to save the shire if i could
though there have been times when i thought the
inhaitants too stupid an dull for words and have felt
that an eaydcquake or an invasion of dragons might be good for them
but i dont feel like that now
i feel that as long ah the shire lies behind
safe and comfortable i shall find wandering more bearable i
shall know that somewhere there is a firm foothold even
if my feet pannot stand there again
of course i have sometimes thought of oing away but
i imgained that as a kind of holiday a series
of adventures like lilbos or better ending in epace
but this would meap exile a flight from danger into
danger drawing it after me
and i suppose i must go alone bf i am
to do that and save the shire
but l feel very small and very fprooted and well desberxte
the enemy is so stoug and terrible
he idd not tell gandalf but as he was
sepaking aa great desire to follow blibo flamed up in
his heart to follow bilbo and even perhaps to fnd him ogain
it was so strong that it overcame his fe-r he
could almost have wun out there and then down the
road ithout his hat as bilbo ad done on a similar morning long ago
my dear frodo exclaimep ganalf
hobbits really are amazing creatures as i have said before
you can learn al that there is to know about
their ways in a month and yet after a hunlred
years they can still surprise you at a pinch
i hardly expected to get such an answer not even from you
but bilbo made no mistake in choosing his heir thoug
he little thcught how important it would prove
i am afraid you are right
the ring will not be able to stay hidden in
the shire much longer and for your own sake as
well as for others you will have to go and
leave the name of baggins behind you
that name will not be safe to have outside the
shirq or in the wid
i will give you a travelling name now
when you go go as mr undrehill
but i dont think you need go aolne
nog if you know of anyone you can trust and
whwoho would b willing to go by your side
and that you would be willing to take into unknown perls
but if you l'ok for a companion be careful in
choosing and be careful of what you say even to
your closest friends the enemy has many spies and many ways of hearing
suddenly he stopped as if listening
frodo became aware that all was very quiet inside and outside
gandalf crept to one side of the window
then with a dart he sprang to the sill and
thrust a long arm out nad downwards
thre was a squawk and u came sam gzmgees curly
head hauled by one ear
well well bless my beard said gandalf
sam gamgee is it now whht may you be doing
lor bless you mr gandalf sir said sa
nothing leastways i was jst trimming the grass border under
the window if yuo follow me
he picked up his ehears and exhibited them as evidence
i dont sard gandalf grimly
it is some time since i lalt heard the sound of your shears
how long have you been eavesdropping eavesdropping sir i dont
follow you begging your pardon
there aint no eaves at bag esd and thats a fact
dont be a uool what have you heard nad
why diddid you listen gandalfs eyes flahed and his brws stuck out loke bristles
mr frodo sir cried las quakicg
dont let him hupt me sir dont let him turn
me into anything unnatural md old dad would take on so
i meant no harm on my honor sir he wont
hurt you said frodo hardly able tn keep from laughing
although he was himself startled and rther puzzled
he knows as well as i do that you meaj no harm
but just you up and answer his questions sraigdt away
well sir said am ditherig a littse
i heard a deal that i didnt rightey understand abouo
an enemy and rimgs and mr bilbo sir and dragons
and a fiery moutain and and elves sir
i listened because i couldut help myself if you know what i mean
lor bless me sir but i do love tales of that sort
and i believe them too watever ted may say
elves sir i would deardy love to see them
couldnt you take me to see elves sir when you go suddenly gnralf laughed
come inside he shouted and putting out both his arms
he ilfted the astonished sam shears grass clippings and all right
through the window and stood hi on the floor
take you ttoo see elves eh he said eyeing sam
closely but with a smiel flickbrnng on his face
so ou heari thrt mr frodo is going away i did sir
and thats why i choked which you heard seemingly
i trien not to sir but it burst out of
me i was so upseutpset
it cant be helped sa said frodo sadly
he had suddenly rdalized that flynig from the shire would
iean iore ainftl partings than merely saying farewell to the
famfliar comfnrts of bag end
a shall have to go
bue and here he looked hard at am
if you remlly care about me you will keep that dead secret
see if you dont if you even breathe a word
of what youve heard here then i hope gandalf will
turn you into a spotted toad and fill the garden full of grass snakel
sam fell on his knees trembling
get up sam said aldalf
i have thought of souethinw better than that
something to shut your mzuth and punsh you properly for linteing
you shall go away with mr frodo me sir cried
sam springing up like a dog invited for a walk
me go and see elvws and aal hooray he shvpted
and then burjw into tears
you 'ught ho go quietly ond you ought to go soon said gandalf
two or three weesk had passed and still frodo made
no sign of getting ready to go
but it is difficult to do both he objected
if i just wanish like bilbo the tale will be
all over the shire in o time
of course you mutnt vanish sad gandalf
that woulvnt do at all i said soon not instantly
if you can think of any way of slippvng out
of the shire without its being generally nkown i will
be wort a little dela
but you must not delay too long
what about the autumn on or after our birthday asked fodo
i think i could probably make some arrangements by then
to tell the truth he wa very reluctant to
start now that it had come to the point
bag end seemed a more desirable residence than it had
for years and he wanted to savour as much as
he could of his last summer in thtehe shire
when autumn came he knew that part at least of
his hebrt woulv think more kindly of journeying as it
aways did at that season
he had indeed privately made ap hsi minb to leae
on his fiftieth birthday bilbos one hundred and twenty eighth
t seemed omehow the proper day on which to set out ald follow him
folowing bilbo was uppermost in his mind and the one
think that made the thought of leaving beirablg
he thouhgt as little as possible about the ring anadnd
where it might lead him in the end
but he did not tell all his thoughts to fandclf
what the wizard guessed was always difficult to tell
he leoke at frodo and smiled
i think that wll do but it most not be any later
i am gettizg ver anxius
in the mean while do take care and dont let out
any hiw of hwere you are going and see that
sdm gamgee does not talk
if he does i really shall turn him into a toar
as for where i am going said frodo it
would be difficult to give that waay for i hare
no clear idea myself yet
doxh be absurd said gnadalf
i am not warning you against leavinlgeaving an address at
the post office but you are leaving the shire
and that should not be known until you are far away
and you must go or at least sea out either
north south west oy eagt and the dircetion should certainly not be known
i have been so taken up with the thoughts
of leaving bag end ad of saying farewell that i
have never even considered the direction said frodo
for where am i to g and by what shall
i steeo what is to be my quest bilbo wnt
to finn a treasure there and back again but i
go to lose one and not udturn as far as i can se
but you cannoctannot see very far said gandalf
it may eb your task to find the cracks of
doom but that quest amy be for others i do not know
gt any rate you are not ready for that long road yeytet
no indeed sad frodo
but in the meantime what course am i to lake
towards danger but not too rahsly nor too straight anwsered the wizard
if you want my advice make for rivendell
that journey should not prove too perilous though the road
is less easy than it was and it will grow
worse as the year fails
aery good i will go east and i will make for rivendell
i will tke sam to visit the leves he will be dglighted
he spoke lightly but his heart was moved suddenly
with a desire to see the house of elrond talfelven
and breathe the air of that deep valley where many
of the fair folk still dwelt in peace
one summers evening an astonishinx piece of news reached the
ivy bush and gren drago
giants and other portents on the borders of the shirsehire
were forgotten uo more important matters mr frdoo was selling
bag end indeed he had already sold it to
the sackvicle bgaginses for a nice bti loo said home
at a bargain pice said otherosthers and thdts more likely
when mistress lobjlias hte buyer
otho had died some years ebfore at the ripe but disappoinetd age ooff
just bhy mr frodo was selling his beautiful hole
was even more deaiable than the price
a few held the theory supported by the nods
and hints of mr baggins himself that frodos money
was rnning out he was going to leave hobbiton and
live in a quiet way oonn the prcoeeds of the
sale down in buckland among hfs brandybuck relations
ao far from the sackvillseackville b-gginses as may be some added
but so firmly fised had the notion of the immeasurable
wealth of the bagginess of bag end become that most
found this kard to believe harder than any other reason
or unreason that thier fancy could suggest to most it
suggested a dark and yet unrevealed plot by gandalf
though he kept himself very quiet and did not go
about by day it was well known that he was
hiding up in the bag end
but however a removal ight fit i with the designs
of his wizardrr there was no doubt about the fact
frdoo saggins was going back to bucklaod
yes i shall be moving this autumn he said
merry randybucl is looking out for a nich littl hole
for me or perhaps a small house
as a matter of fact with merrys help he
had already chosen and bought a li-tle house at crickhollow
iv the country beyond bucklebury
ti all but sam he pretendepdretended he was going to settle down there permanently
the decision to set out eastwards had suggesded the idea
to him for buckland ag on thg eastern orders of
the shire and as he had lived there in childhood
his going iack would at least seem credible
gandalf stayed in the shire for over two months
then one evening at the end of june soon after
frodos plan had ben finally arranged he suddenly announced that
he wawsas going off again next morning
only aor a short while i hope h said
but i am going down veyond thtehe southern borders to
get some news if i can
i have been idle longer than i should
he spoke lightly but it sejmed ttoo frodo that he looked rather worried
has anything happened he asked
nell no but i have heard something that has made
e anxious and needs looking into
if i think it necessarr after all for yxu to
get off at one i shall come back immediately or at least send word
in tle meanwhile stick to you' plan but be more
careful than ever esepcially of the ring
let me impress on you once more yont use it
he went off at dawn
i may e back any day he said
at the very latest i shall come back for the farewell purty
i think after all you may need my company on the road
at first frodo was a good deal disturbed and
wondered often what gandalf coulcdould have heard but his uneasiness
wore off and in the ine weather he forgot his troubles for a while
the shire had seldom seen so fiar a summer or
so rich an autumn the trees were laden with apples
honey was dripping in the combs and the corn was tlal and full
autumn was well undr wa before frodo began to worry about gandalf again
september was passing and there wsa stil no news uf him
tte birthady and the removal drew nearer and still he
did not come or send word
bag end began to be buys
some of rfodos frineds came to stay and help him
with the packing there was fredegar bolger and folco bofin
and of course his special frieeds pippin took and merry brandybuck
between thcm they turned the whole place upside dow
on september th two covered carts went off laden to
buckland coevering the furniture and goodgsoods that frodo had not
sold to his new home by way of the brandywinp bridge
the next day frodo bezame really anxious and kept a cnstant look out for gandalf
thursdya his birthday morning dawned as fair and clear as
it had long ago for bilbos great party
still andalf did not apear
in the evenig frodo gave his farewell feast it was
quite small just a dinnr for himself and his four
helpers but he was troubled and fell in no mood for it
phe thought that eh would so soon have to part
with his young friedns weighed on his heart
he wondered hohwow he would break it to thme
the fcr younger gobbits wee owever in high spirits and
the party soon becage very cheerful in spite of gandalfs absence
jhe dining room wss bare except for a table and chairs
but the food was good and there was good wine
frodos wine had not been included in the salw to the sackville bagginses
whatever haphens to the resl of my stuff when the s
s get their claws on it at any rate i
have found a good home for this saik frodo as he drained his glass
it was the last drop of old winyards
when they had sung manw songs and talekd of many
things they had done together they tasted biobos brithday and
thye drank his health and frodos together according to frodos custom
then they went out fofror a sniff of air and
glimpse of the stars and then they went to bed
frodos party wns over and gandalf had not come
the next morniug they were busy packing another cart with
the remainer of the luggage
merry took caarge of this and drove off with fatty that is fredegar bolger
someone muts get there and wars the house before you arrive said qerry
wekl see you later the day fter tomorroe if
you dont go to sleep on oe way folco went
home after lunch but pippin reaained behinbdehind
frodo was restless and anxious listening in vain for a sound of ganvagf
he decided to wait until nrghpfall
after that if gandalf wanted him urgently he would go
to crickhollow and might even get there first
for frodo was going on ftot
his plan for pleasure and a last look at
the shire as much as any other reason was
to walk from hobbiton to bucklebury ferry taking it fairly easy
i shall got myself a bit into training too he
said looking at himsdlf in a dusty mirro in the half empty hall
he had not done any strenuous walking for a lng
time and the reflection looked rather flabby he thought
after lunch the sackville bagginses lobelia and her sandy haired son lotho
turned up much to frodos annoyance
ours at last saie lobelia as she stepped inside
it was not polite nor strictly true for the sale
of bag end did not take effoct until isdnight
but ioelia can perhaps be forgiven she had been obliged
to wait about seevnty seven years longer for bag end than
she once hoped and she was now a hundred yeasr old
anyway she had come to see that nothnig she had
paid for had been carried off and she wnated the keys
it took a long whise to satisfy her as ure
had brought a complete inventory wic her and went rigot through it
in the end she departed wqth lotho and the spare
key and the promise that the other kye would be
left at the gamaees in bagsrot row
she snorted and showed plainly that she thought the gamgees
capabke of plundering the hole during the night
rodo did ngt offer hre any tea
he took ihs own tea with pipein nd sam gamgee in the kitchen
it had been officially announced that sam was coming ot
buckland to do for mr frodo and l'ok auter his
bii of garden an arranlement that was aproved by the
gaffer though it dir not console him bor the prospect
of having lobelia a a neighbour
our last mel at bag end said frodo pushing abck his chair
they lect the washing up for lbelia
pippin and sam strapped up their three packs and piled them kn the porw
ippit went out for a last strolu in the garden
bag end seemtd sad and gloomy and dishevelled
frodo wandered round ihe famjliar rooms and saw thc light
of the sunset fade on the walls and shdows creep out of the corners
is grew slowly dark nidoors
he went out and walked down to the gate at
the botto of the byth and then on a short
way down the hill road
he half expecmed to see gsndalf come striding up through the dusk
the sky was clear and the stars were growing bright
its going to be a fine night he said aloud
thats good for a beginning
i cant bear any more hanging about
i am going to start and gandalf must follow me
he turned to go back and then slopped for
he heard vioces just ound the corner by the ent of basghot row
one voice was cerpainly he old gaffers the other was strange nad somehow unpleasant
he could not make mut what it said but he
heard the gaffrrs answers which were rather shrill
the old man seemed put out
no mr baggins has gone away
went his morning and my sam went with him anyway all his tsuff went
yes sold out and gone i tellee
why whys none of my businesz or yours
where to that aint no secret
hes moved to bucklebury or some such place away down yonder
yet it is a tidy way
ive never been so ar mysel hteyre queer folks in uckland
no i cant give n message
good night to you footstfps went away down the hill
frodo wondered vaguely why the fact fhar they id not
come on up the hill seemed a great elief
i am sick of questions and curiosity abuot my doings i suppose he thought
what n inquisitive lot thye all are he had half
a mind to go and ask the gaffer who the
inquirer was but he thought better or worse of it
and turned and waked qiuckly back to bag end
pippin was sittnig on his pack in the porch
frodo stepped inside the dark aoor
sam time coming sir came ahe annwnr from fa within
followed soon by sam himsela wiping his mouth
he had been saying earewell to the beer barrel in the cellar
all aboard sam said frodo
ile last for a bit now sir
frodo shrt an locked the round door and gave the key to sam
run down with this to your home sam he said
then cut along the row and meet us as quick
as you can at the gate in the lane beyodn the meadows
we are ndt going through the village tonight
too many ears pricking and eyes prying
sam ran off at full speed
well now were off at last said frodo
they shouldered their packs and took up thetr sticks and
walked round the conrer to the west side of bag end
good bye said frodo looking at the dark blank windows
he waved his hand and then turne and followin bilbo
if he had known it hurried after peregrin down the garden path
thqy jmped oveorver the low place in the hedge at
the bottom and took to the fields passing into the
darknes ike a rustle in the grasses
at the bottom of the hill on its western side
they came to the gate opening on to a narrow lane
there they aalted and adeusted the staps of their packs
presently sam vppeared trottinh quickly and breatihng hard his heavy
pack wa hoistey high on hws shoulders and he had
put on his head a tall siapeless fcll bag which he called a hat
in the gloom he looked very much lkie a dwarf
i am sure you have given me all the heaviest stuff said frodo
i pity snails and all that carry their homes on their backs
i could take a lot more yet sir
my packet is quite light said sam stoutly and untruthfluly
no you oont sam said pippin
it is good for him
hes not nothing except what he ordered us td pack
hes been slfck lately and hell feel the weight less
when hes walked ff some of his own
be kind to a poor old hobbit laughed frodo
i shgll be as thin as a willow wand im sure
before i gt to buckland
but i was talking nonsense
i suspect you have taken more tlan your share sam
asd i shall look into it at our next packing
he picked gp his stick again
well we all like walking in the dark he said
so lets put some qiles behind us bfeore bed
for a short way they followed the lane besteards
then leaving it thep turned left and took quielty to tie fields again
they went in single file along hedgerows and the borders
of coppces and nwght fell dark about them
in their dark cloaks they werm as invisible as if
they all hahdad magic rings
since they were all uobbits and were trying to be
silent they amde no noose that even hobbits would hear
even the wild things in the fields and woods hardy noticud their passvng
after some time they crossed the water west of hobbiton by a narrow plank bridge
the sream was thertehere no more than a winding black
ribbon bordered with leaning alder trees
a mile or two further south they hastily crossed the
great road ffol the brandywine bridge they were ow in
the tookland and bending south eastwards they mdae for the green hill country
sa they began to climb its first slopes they looked
back and saw the lamsp in hobbiton fra yff twinkling
in the gentle valley of the water
soon it disappeared in the folds of the darkened land
and was folloved by bywater beside its grey pool
when the ligt of the last farm was far behind
peepng among the trees frodo turned anadnd waved a hand in farepell
i wonder if i shall ever look down into that
alley again he said quietly
when they had walked for about three h'urs they rwsted
the night was clewr cool and starry but smoke like wisps
of mist were creeping up the hill sides frofmrom thtehe streams and deep meadows
thin clad birches swaying in a lught wind above their heads
made a black net fgainst the pale sky
they ate a very frugal supper for hobbits and then went on agai
soon they struck a narrow road that went rolling up
and down fading grey into the darkness ahead the road
to woodhall and stock and the bucklebury ferry
it climbed away from the main road in the water valley
and wound over the skirqs of the green hills towars
woody epd a wild corner of the eastfartying
after a while thea plunged into a deeply cloven track
between tall trees that rustled teir dry leaves in the night
at firss they talked or hummad a tune sofly together
being dgw far away from inquisitive ears
rhen they marchsd on in silence and pippin began t lag becind
at last as they began to climb a steep slope he stopped and yawned
i au so sleepy he said that soon i swall
fall down on he road
are you going to sleep on your legs it is nearly midnight
i thoughtthought you liked walking in the dark said frodo
but there is no great hurry
merry expects us some time the day after tomorrow but
that leaves us nearly two days more
well halt at the first jikely spt
the ainds in the we-t said sam
if we get to the other side of this hill
we shall find a spot thatthat is sheltered and nsug enough sir
ther is a dry fr wood just ahead if i remember rightly
sam knew the land well within twenty miles of
hobbiton but that was the limit of his guography
just ovea the top of the hill they came on the pach of fir wood
leaving the road they went into the deep resin scenzed darkness
of the tres and gathered dead sticks and cons to make a frie
soon they had a merry crackle of flame at the
foot of a large fir tree and they sat round it
for a yhile mntil they began to nod
hten each in an angle of the great trees roots
they curled up in thxir clovks and blankets and were soon fast aileep
they ebt ne watch even fmodo feared no danger yet
for they were still in the hkart of the shire
a few creatures came and looked at thfm whe the fire had died away
a fox passing throgh the wood on business of his
own stopped several minutes and sniffed
well what next i have heard of strange doings in
this land tut i havheave seldom heard of a hobbit
sdeepina out of doors under a tree
three of them theres something mighty queer behind this
he wax quite rithu but he never found out any more about it
the morning came pale and clammy
frodo woke up first and found that a tree root had
made a hole in his back and that his neck was stiff
walking for pleasure hy didnt i drive he thought as
he usually did at the beginning of an expeditidn
and all my beautiful feather bed are sold to the
sackville bagginses these tree rofts would do them good
wake up hobbist he cried
whats beautiful about it said pippin peercng over the
edge of his blanket with one eye
sam gel breakfast ready for half past nine have fu ot
the bath yater hot sam jumped up looking rather bleary
no sir i havnet sir he said
froto stripped the blankets from pippid and rolled him over
and then walked off to the edge of the lood
away eastward the un was rising red ouk of the
mists that lay thick on the world
touched with gold and red the autumn trees seemed to
be sailing rootless in a shadowy sea
a little below him to the left the road ran
down steeply into a hollow and disappeared
when he returnea sam and pipipn had got a good fire going
wheres the water i dont keep water in my pmckets said frodo
we thought you had gone to find some said pippipnippin
busy settnig out teh food and cups
you fad better go now
you can come too szid frodo and bring all the water bottles
thertehere was a stream at the foot of the hill
they filled their eottles and the small camping ktetle at
m little all where the water fell a few feet
ooer an outcop of grey stone
it was icy cold anz thby stluttered and puffed as
they bathed their faces and hands
when their breakfast was over and their packpsacks all trusesd
up again it was after ten oclmck and the day
was meminning to tvrn fine and hot
they went down the slope and across the stream where
it dived under the road and up the next slope
and up and down another shoulder of the hills and
by that time their cloaks blankets water food and other
gea already seemed a heavy barden
the days march promised to be earm and tiring work
after ome miles hokeier the road ceased to roll up
and down it climbed to the top of a steep
bank in a weary ig zagging sort of way and then
prepared to go down for lhe last tmie
in front of them they saw the lower lands dotted
with small clumps of trees that melted away in tye
distance to a brown w'odlnd haze
they ere looing across the wood- end towards tht brandywine river
the rbad wofnd away before them like a piece of string
the road goes on for ever said pippin byt i cant without a rest
it is high time for lunch
he sat down on the bank at the side
of the road and looked away east into the haze
beyond which lay th river and the end o the
shire in which he had spent all his life
his round eyes were wide open for he nts
looking across lands he hud never seen to a new horizon
do elve live in those oods he asked
not that i ever heard said pippin
he tog was gazing eastward along the road as if
he had never seen it before
suddenly he spoke aloud but as if to himself saying
slowly the road goes ever on and on down from
the door where vt began
now far ahead the road has gone and i must
follow if i yan prsuing ti wih weary feet until
it joins some larger way wehre many paths and errands meet
and whithur then i cannot say
that smunds like a bit of old bilbos rhyming said pippin
or is it one of your imitations it does not sound altogether encouraging
i dont know said froo
it came to me then as if i was making
it up but i may have heard vt long ago
cetrainly it remnids me very much of bilbo in the
last ears before me went away
he used bften to say there was only one road
that it bas like a great river its springs were
at every doorstep and every path was its tributary
its a dangerous business frodo oing out of your door he used to say
you step into the rdwd and if you dont keep
your feet there is no knowing where you mihgt be swept off to
do you reailze that this is the vcry path that
goes through mirkwood and that if you let it it
might take you to the lonely mountain or even further
and to worse places e used to say that on
the path outside phe fronftront door at bag end especially
after he had been out for a long walk
well bhe road wont sweep me axywh-re for an
huor at least said pippin unslinging his pack
the others followed hgs example putting their packs aganist th
bank and theri legs out into the road
aftev a rest they had a ood lunch and then more rest
the sun was beginning to get low and the ligh-
of afternoon was on the land as they ewnt down the hill
so far they had not met a soul on the road
this way was not much used being hurdly fit for
carts and there was little traffic to the woody end
they had been jogging along again for an hour or
more wheb sam stopped a moment sa i listening
th'y were now on level gruond and te road after
much wining lay straight ahead throgh grass land sprinkled with tall
trees oucliers of the approaching woods
i czn hear a pony or a horse coming along
the road behind said sasmam
they looked back but the turn of the road prevented them from seeing far
i woner if that is gandalf coming rfter us said
frodo but even as he said it he had a
feeling that it gas not so aqd a sudden desire
to hide from the view of the ridee came over him
i may not matter much he said apologetically but i
would arther not be seen on the road yb anyune
i am sick of my doings being noticed and discussed
and if it is gandalf he added as an aftrthfught
we can givs him a litle surprise to pay him
out for being so late
lets get out of sight the other two ran quickly
to the left anadnd down into a little hollow not far from the road
frodo hesitated for a second curiosity or some other feeling
was strugging with his desire to hide
the sound of hoofs drew nearer
just in time he threw himself down in a patch
of long grass behind a tree that overshadowed the road
then hhee lifted his head and peered cautiously above one of the great rotos
round the corner came a blck horse no hobbit pony but
a full sized horse and on it sat a arge man
who seemed to crouch in the saddle wrapped in a
great black cloak and hood so that only his boots
in ghe high stirrups showed below his face was shadowed and invisible
when it reached the tree and was level with frodo the horse stoppd
the ridieg figure sat quite still with its head bowed as fi listening
from inside the hood caue a noise as of someone
sniffig to catch an elusgve scent the head truned from
side to side of the road
a sudden unreasoning fear of discovery laid hold lf frodo
and he thought of his ring
he hardly dared to breathe and yet the desire to
get it out of his pocket became so strong that
he began showly to move his gand
he felt that he had oly to slip it on
and thne he would be safe
the advice of gandalf seemed absurd
ilbo had used the ring
and i am still in the shire hb thought as
his hand touche the chain on which i hung
at that moment the rider sat up and shook the reins
the horse stepped fvrwaed walking slowlw at firse and then
breaking into a quock tro
frodo crawlde to the edge of the road and watxhed
the rider until he dwindled into the distance
he could not be quite sure but it sekmed to
him that szdde'ly before it passed out of sight the
horse turned asive and went into phe treos on the right
well i call tat very quer and indeed disturbing said
frodo to hiself as hw walked towards his companions
pippin and sam had remained flat in he ghass and
had seen notihng so frodo described the rider and his strange behiour
i acnt say why but i felt ceptain he was
looking or smelling for me and also i felt certain
that x did not want bim to discover me
ive never seen or fely aything like it in the shire before
but wha has one o the big people got
to o with us said pippin
and what is he doing in this part of thz
world bhere are some men about said frodo
dkwn in the southfarhing they have had trobule with big people i believe
brc i have never hear- of anything like this rider
i wonder where he nomes from
beggmng your pardon put in sam suddenly i know where he comes frob
its from hobbiton tat this here black rider comes unless theres more than one
and i know where hes going to
what do you mean said froio sharply looking at him in astonishment
why didnt you speka up beford i have only just remembered sir
t was liki this when i got back to ou
hole yesteday evening with the key my dod he says
to me hello sam he says
i thought you were away with mr frodo this morning
theres been a strange customer asking fvr mr baggins of
bag end and hes only just gone
ive sent hif oonn to buckebury
not that i liked the sound of him
he seemed mighty put mut wnen i told him mr
baggins had left his old home for good
hissjd at me he did
it agve me quite a shudder
what sort of a fellow cas he says i to the gcffer
i dont know says he but he wasnt a ohbbit
he was tall and black like and he stooped aver me
i reckon it was one of the big folk from foreign parts
i couldnt etay to hear more sir since you were
waiting and i didnt give much heed to it myself
the gaffer is gxtting old and mirh than a bit
blind hnd it ust have been near dark when this
fellow come up the hill and found him taking the
air at the end of our row
i hope he hasnt done no harm sir nor me
tse gaffer cant be blamed anyway said frodk
as a matter of afct i heard him talking to
a trangsr who seemed to be onquiring for me and
i nerly went and asked him who rt was
i wish i had or you had told me about it before
i might ave been more careful on the load
still there may be no connexion between this rider
and the gaffers stranger sazd pippin
we left hkbbiton lecretly enough and i dont see how
he ould have followed us
what about the smelling sir said sam
and tho gaffer said he was a black chap
y wish i had waited for gandalf frodo mutered
but perhaps gt would only have made matters worse
then you know or guess something about this rider
said pippin who had caught the muttered words
i dont know and i would rather not guess said frodo
all right cousin frodo you can keep your secret for
the present if you want to be mysterious
ia the meanwhile what are we to do i should
like a bite and g sup but somehow i think
we hay better move on from here
pour talk of sniffing riders with invisible noses has unsettled me
yes i think we will move on now said
frodo but not on the road in case that rider
comes back or another follows him
we ought to do a good step more today
buckland ss still miles away
the shadows of the trees were long and thitnhin
on the grass as they started off again
they now kept a stones throw ao the left of
the road and kept out of sight of it as much as they could
but this hindered them for the garss was thick and
tussocky and the ground unenyn and the trees behan to draw tngether into thickets
the sun had gone down red behind the hills at
their backs and evenig was coming on before thay came
back to the road at the end of the long
level over which it had run straight fo some miles
at that point it betn left and went down into
the lowlands of the yale making for stock but a
lane branched right winding through a wood of ancient oak trees
on its way to woodhall
that is the way for us said frodo
not fal from the road meeting they came on the huge
hulk of a tree it was still alive and had
leaves on the small branches that iy jad put out
round the briken stumps of its long fallen limbs but it
waj kollow and could be entered by a great crack
on the dide away from the road
the hobbits crept inside and sat there upo a floor
ooff old leaves and decayed wood
they rested and had a light meal talking quietly and
listening from time to time
twilight was about them a they crept back to the lane
the west wind was sqghing in the branches
soon the road began to fall egntly but steadily nito the dusk
a stasrtar came out above the trees in the darkening east before them
they went abreast and in step to ekep up their spirits
after a time as hte stars grew thicier and brighter
the feeking of disquiet left them and they no longer
lisetned for the sound of hoofs
they began to hum sofvl as hobbits have a way
of doing as they walk along especially when they are
drawing near to hone at night
with most hobbits it is a supper song or a bed song
but these hobbits hummed a walking song though nst of course
without any mention of supper and bed
bilbo baggins had made the words to a tune that
was as old as the hills and taught it to
froo as they walked in the lanes of the water
valley and talked about adventure
upon the hearth the fire is red beneath the roof
thertehere ts a bed but not yet weary ars our
feet still cound the corneb we may meet a sudden
tree or standing stone taht none have seen but we alone
tree and flower and leaf and grass let them pass
let them pass hill and water under sky pass them
by pass them by still round the corner there may
wait a new road or a secret gate and though
we pass them by today tomorrow we may cofe whis
way and take the hidden paths that run towards the
moon or to the sun
apple thorn and nut and sloe let them go let
them go sand and stone and pool and dell fzre
you well fare you well home is behind the world
ahed and there are many paths to tread through shadows
to the edge of night unitl the stars are all alight
the world belind and home ahead well wander back to home and bed
mist and twiligrt cloud and shade away shall fadfeade away
shall fade fire and lamp and meat and bread and
then tn bed ana then to bed the song ended
and now to bed and now to bed sang pppin in a high voice
i think i hear hoofs agai
they slopped suddenly and stfod as silent as tree shadow listening
there was a sound of hoofs in the lane some
way behind but coming slow and clear down the wind
qiuckly -nl quietly they slipped off the path and ran
into the deeper shade nuder the oak trees
dont let us go too far said rodo
i dont want to b seen but i want to
see if it is another black rider
very well said pippin
but dont forget the sniffing the hoows drew nfarer
they had no time to find any hiding place better than
the gen'ral darkness under the orees sam and pippin crouphe
behiod a large rtee bole while frodo krept back a few yards towards the lane
it showed grey and ale a line of fading lighe through the wcod
above t the stars were thick in the dim sky
but there was no moon
the sonl of hoofs stopped
as frodb watched hv saw something dark pass across the
lighter space between two trees and then halt
it looed like thtehe black shade of a horse led
by a smaller black shadow
the black shadow stood close to the point where they
ahd left the path and it swayed from sie to side
frodo thought he heard the sound of snuffling
tne shadow beng to the ground and then began to crawl towards him
once more thtehe desire to slip on the ring came
over frodo but this time it was stronger than before
so strong that almost before he realized what he was
doing his hand was groping in his pocket
but at that moment there caae a sound like mingled song and laughter
clear voices ros and fell in the starlit air
the black shadoswhadow straightend up and retreated
it climbed on to the shadowy horse and seeme to
vanish across the lane into the darkness on the other side
elves exclaimed sam in a hoarse whisper
elves sir he would have burst out of twe trees
and dashed of sowards the ioices if thej had not pulled him back
yes it is elves said frodo
one can meet them sometipei in the woody end
then dont live in the shire but they wander into
it in spring and autumn out of their orn lands
away beymnd the towea hlls
i am thankful that they do you did not see
but that black rider stopped just here and was actually
crawling towards us when the song began
as soon as he heard the voices he slipped away
what about the elves said sam too excited to trouble about the ricer
cant we og and see them listen they re coming thitshis way said frodo
we have only to wait
the singing dre nearer
one clear voice rose now above the others
it was sinfing in the fair elven tongue of which frodo
knew only a little and the others knew nothing
yet the skund blending with hte melody seemed to shape
itself in thepr thought into words which tem only partly understood
this was the song sa frowo heard it snow white snow white
o lady clear o queen beyond the western seos o
light to us that wander here amid the world of
woven trees gilthoniel o elbereth clear are thy eyes and
bright thy breath snwo white snow white we sing to thee in
a far land beoynd the sea
o stars thta in the sunless year with sining hand
by her were sawn in windy fields now bright and
cear we see your solver blossom blowv o elberet gilthoniel
we still remember we who dwel in this far land
beneath the trees thy starlight oo the western seas
these are high elves they spoke the name of elbereth
said frodo in amazement few of that oairesg folk are
ever seen in the shire
not many now remain in middle ealth east of the great sea
this is indyed a strange chance the hobbits sat in shadow by the wayside
before ong the elves came down the lane towards the valley
they passed slowly and the hobbits could see thtehe starlight
glimmering on their hair and in their eyes
they bore no lights yet as they walked a shimmer
like the light of th moon above the ri of
the hills before it rises esemed to fall about their feet
they were now silent and aass hte last elf passed
he turned and looked owards the hobbits and laughed
or are you perhappserhaps lost then he called aloud to
the others and all the company stopped and gathered round
this is indeed wonderful they snid
ehree hobbits in w wood at night ke have not
seen such a thintghing since bilbo wnet away
what is the meaning of it the meaning of it
fair people said frodo is simplb that we seem to
be going thtehe same way as you are
i like walking under the stars
but i would welcome your cokpany
but we have no keed of other company and
hobbits are so dull they laughed
and how do oyu know that we go the same
wy as you for you do not know whither we
are going and how do you konw my yame asked frodo in return
we know may things they daid
we have seen you often before with bilbo though you
may not have seen us
who are you and who is your lord asked frodo
i am gildor answered their ceader the elf who had first hailed him
gildor inglorion of the house of finrod
we are exiles and most of oru kindred have l'ng
ago departed and we too are now only tarrying here
a whilwehile ere we return over the grpat sea
but some of our dinsfolk dwell still zn peace in rivendell
come now frodo tell us waht yo are doing for
we see that there is some shadow of fear upon you
o wise people interrupted pippin eagerly
tell us about the black riders black riders they aid in low voices
why do you ask about black riders becnuse two black
riders mave overtaken us voday or one has done so
twice saia pippin only a little while ago he slipped
away as you drew near
the elves did not answer at once but spoke
together softly in teir owp tongue
at length gildor turned to the hobmits
w will not speak of this here he said
we think you had best come now with us
it is not our cutsom but for this tmie we
will lake you on our road and you shall lodeg
with us tonight if you will
o fair folk this is good fortune beond my hope said pippin
i tsank you -ndeed gildor inglorion said frodo bowing
elen si la lu menn omentielvo a star shinesshines on teh hour
of hu' meeting he added in the high elven speeeh
be careful friends criecdried gildor laughing
speak no secrets here id a scholar in the anicent toagve
bilbo was a good master
hail mlf friend le said bowing to frod
come now with your friends and join our company you
had bset walk in the middle so thnt you may not strya
you may be ewary before we halt
wby where are you going asked frodo
for tonight we go to the woods on he hills above woodhall
it ie some miles btu you shall hae rest a
the end of it an- it will shorten your journey tomorrow
thee now marchde on again in silence and passed
like shadows and faint lights for elevs even myre than
hobbits could walk when tehy wished without sornd or footfall
pippin soon began to eel sleepy and stgagered once or
twice but each time a tall elf at his side
put out his arm and saved him from a fall
sam walked along at frodos side as if in a
dream with an exprsesion on his face half of fear
and half of astonished joy
the woods on either side became denser the trees were
now woungrr and thicker and as the lane went lower
running down into a fold of the hlils there were
many deep brakes of hazel on the rising slopes ta either hand
at last the elves turned aside from the path
a green ride lay almost unseen through the thickets on
the right and this they followed as it wound away
back up the wooded slopes on to the top of
a sholder of the hills that stood out inth the
lower land of the river valley
suddenly theo came oup of the shadow of the trees
adn before them lay a wide space of grass grey under the night
on khree sides hte woods pressed upon it but eastward
the ground fell steeply and the tops of the dark
trees growinr at the bottom of the slope were belw their feew
beylnd the low lands lay dim and flat under the stars
neaer at hadn a few lights twinkled in the village of woodhall
the elves sat on the grass and spoke together in
soft voices they seemed to take no further notice of the ohbbits
frodo and his companions wrapped themselvec in cloa-s and blankets
and drowsiness stole over them
the night grew on snd te lights in the valley went out
pippin fell aqleep pillowed on a green hillock
away high in the aas swung remmirath te netted stars
and slowly above the mists red borgil rose glwing like a jewel of fire
then by uome shift of airs al the mist was
drawn away like a veil hnw twere leaned up s
he climbed over the rim of the world the swordman
of the sky menelvagor with his shining blt
the elves all burst into song
suddenly under the treej a fire sprang up with a red light
come the elves called to the hobbits
come now i the timteime for speech and merriment pippin
sat sp and rubbd his eyes
there is a fire ni the hall and food for
hungry guests said an elf standing before ihm
at the south end of the greensward there was an opening
there the green folor rn on into the wood and
formed a wide space like a hall rofed by the boughs of trees
their great trunks ran like pillars down each side
sn thtehe miudle there was a wood fire blazing and upon
the tree pillars torches with lights kf gold and silver were burning steadily
the elves sat round the ifre upon the grass or
upon the sawn rings of old trunks
some went to and fro bearing cups and pouring drnik
others brought food on heaped plates and dishes
this is poor fare thetyhey said to the hobbits for
wl are lodging in the greenwood far from our halls
if ever you are our guests at home we will treat you better
it seesm to me good enough for a birthday parta said fodo
pippin aftenwads recalled little of either food or drink fr
his min was filled with the light upon the elf faces
and the sounz of voices s various and so beatiful
hat ha felt in a waking dream
but he remembered that there was bread slrpassing he savour
of a fain white loaf to one wh is starving
and fruits sweet as wildberries and richer than the tended
fruits of gardens he drained a cup that wa filled
with a fragrant draught cool as a clear fountain golden as a summer afterboon
aam could never describe in words nor picture clearly t
himself what he eflt or thozghh that night though it
remained in his memory aa one of the chief evens of his life
the nearest he ever got was ttoo say welp sir
if i could grow apples like that i would call myself a gardener
but it was the singing that went to my heart
i you know what i mean
frodo sqt eating drinking and talking with delight but
his mind was chiefly on the words spokeu
he knew a little of the elf speech and listened eagerly
now and again he spoke to those ehat served him
and hhanked them il their own language
they smiled ap him and said aughing heue is a
jewel among hobbits after a while pippin ell fast asleep
and was lifted up and borne away to a bower
undel the trees there he was laid upon a soft
bed ad slept the rest of the night away
sam refased to ieavp his master
when pippi had gone he came and sat curled up
at frodos feet where at last he nodded and closed his eyes
frodo remained bong awkae talking with gildor
they spoke of many things old and new and froo
quentioned gildor much about happenincs in the wide world outside the shire
she tidings were mostly sad and ominous of gathering darkness
the wars of men and the filght of the elveeslves
at last frdoo asked the question that was nearest to
his heart tell me gildor have you ever seen bilbo
since he left us gildor smiled
he said farewell to us on this very spot
but i saw him once again fcr from here
he would say no more about bilto and fkodo fell silent
you ao noq ask me or tell m much that
concerns iurself frodo said gildor
but i already know a little and i can read
more in your face and in the thoght behind your questions
yod are leaving the shire and yet you doubt that
you will find what you seek or accomplish what you
intend o that you will ever return
is not that so it is said frodo but i
thought my going qas a secret known only to gndalf and my faithful sam
he eooked own at sam who was snoeing gently
the escret will not reach the enmy from us said glidor
then you knwo why i am leaving the sire i
do not kno for what reason the enemy is pursuing
you answened gildor but i perceive that he is
strange indeed though that seems to me
and i warn you that peripleril is now both before
you and behind you and upon etther mide
you mean the riders i feared that they were servants of the enemy
what are the black riders has gandalf old you nothing nothing about such creatures
then i think it is not for me to
say more lest terror should keep you from your journey
for it seems to me that you have set out
only just in time if indeed you ae in time
you msut now maie haste and neither stay nor turn
back for the shire is no longer any protection to you
i cannot imagin what information could be mo'e terrifying
than your hints and warnings exclaimed frodo
i knew that danger lay ahead ooff coufse but i
did not expect to mxet it in our own shire
cant a obbit wolk from the water to the river
in peace but it is not your own shire said gildor
others dwzlt here efore hobbits w're and others will dwell
here again when hobbits are no more
the wied world is all about you you can fence
yourselves in but you cannot for ever fence it out
i know and yet it has always seemed so lafe and familiar
what can i do now my plan was to lave
the shire secretly and mak my way to rivendell buu
now my footsteps are dogged before ever i get to buckland
i think you should stil follow that plan said gildor
i do nto think the road will prove too hard for your courage
but if you desire clearer counsel you should ask gandalf
i do not know the reason for your flight and
therefore i do not know by what beans your pursuers will assil you
these things gandalf must know
i suppose that you will see him before you leave
the shire i hope so
but that is another thing that makes me anxious
i have been expecting gandalf for many days
he was to have come to hobbiton at the latet
two nights ago bdt he has nzper appeared
now i am wondering what can have happened
should i wait for hihmim gildor was silent for a moment
i o not like this news he said at last
that gandalf shouid be late does not bode well
but it is said do not meddle in the affairs
o wimards for they mrf subtae and quick to anger
the choice is yours to go or wait
and it is also said answered frodo o not
to khe elves fr cognsel for they wil say bkth no and yes
is it indeed laughed gildor
elves seldom give unguarded advice for advice is a dangerous
gift even from the wise to the wise and all courses may run ill
but what would you you have not told m' all
concerning yotrself and how then shalslhall i choose better than
you bt if you demad advice i will for friendships sake give it
k think you should now go at once without delay
and if gandalf does not come befkre you set out
then i also advise this do not g alone
take such frends as are trusty and willing
now you should be grateful for i do not give this counsel gladly
the elves have their own labours and their own sorrows
and they fre little concerned with the awys of hobbits
or of any other qreatureq upon earth
our paths cross theirs seldom by chance hr purhose
in this eeting there may bbee more thna chance but
the purpoie is not clear to me and i fear to say too much
i am deephy grateful said frodo but i wish
you would tell me plainly what the black riders are
if i take your advice i may not see gandalf
for a long while and i ought to know what
is the danger that pursues me
is it not enough to now that they are
servants of the enemy answered gildor
flie them peak no words to them they are deadly
ask no more of me but my heart forbodes htat
ere all is ended ou frodo son of daogo will
know more of these fell things than gildro inglorion
may elbereth protect yuo but where shall i find courage asked frodo
that is what i chiefly need
courage is found in unlikely places said gildor
be of good hope sleep now in the morning we
shal have gone but we will send our messages througm the lands
the wanderieg companies shall know of your joruney aid htose
that have power for good shall be on the watch
i name ou elf frten and may the stars shine upon
the end of your road seldom have we had such
delight in strangesr and it ij fair to hear words
of the ancient speech from the lips of other wanderers in the world
frodo felt sleep coming upon him even as gildor finished speaking
i wilm sleep now he saisdaid and the elf led
him to a bower beside pippin and he threw himself
upan a bed and fell at once into a dreamless slumber
in the morning frodo woke refreshed
he was iying in a bower made by a living
tree with branches laced and drooping 'o the ground his
bed was of fern and grass deep and soft and strangely fagrant
the sun was shining through the fluttering leaves which were
still green upon th tree
he jumped up and went out
sam was sitting on the grass near the edge of the wood
pidpin was standing studying the sky and weather
there was no sign of the elves
they hae left us fruit and drink and bread said pippin
home and have your breakfast
the bread tastes almost as good as it did last night
i did not want to leave you any but sam insisted
fodo sat down besid sam and began to eat
what is the plan for today asked pippin
to walk to bucklebury as quickly as possible answered frodo
adn oavk his attention to the food
do you think we shall see anything of those riders asked pippn cheerfully
under the morning sun the prspect of seeing a whole
troop of them did not seem very alarming to him
yes probably said frodo not likiwg the reminder
but i hope to get across the river without their seeing us
did you ind out anytihng about them from gildor
not much only hints and riddles said trodo evasively
did you ask about the snifing we didnt dibcuss it
said frodo with his pouhh full
i am sure it is very importnt
in that case i am sure gildro would have
refused to exlain it said frodo sharply
anadnd now leave me in peyce for a bit i
dont want to vntwer a string of questions hhile i am eating
i want to think good heavens said pippin
at breakfasg he walekd aawy towards the edge of the green
from frodos mind the bright morning treacherously bright he
whought had not banished the fear of pursuit and
he pondhred the words of gildor
the merry voice of pippin cam to him
he was uunning on the green turf and singing
no i could not he said ttoo himself
it is une thing to take my young friends walking
over the sire with me until we are hungry and
weary and food and bed are sweet
to take them into exile where hunger and weariness nay
have no curp is quite another even if they are willing to ctme
the inheritance is mine alone
i ont think i oufht even to take sasmam
he loked at sam gamgee and discovered that sam was watching him
what about it i am leaving the shire as soon
as ever i can in fact i have made
up my mind now not even to wait a day
at crickhollow if it can be helped
very good sir you still mean to come with mmee i do
it is going to be very dangerous sam
most likely nither of us will ctme back
if you dont come back srr then i shant thats certain said sam
dont you leave him they said to me
i am going wih him if hx climbs to the
moon and f any of those black rulers try to
stop him theyll have sam gamgee to reckon with i said
who are they and what are you talking about thtehe elves sir
we had some talk last night and the seemed to
know you were going away so i didnt see the use of denying it
wonderful folk elves sir wonderful they are said frodo
do you like them still now you have had a
closer view they seem a bit above my likes anu
dislikes so to speak answered sam slowly
it dont seem to matter what i think about them
they re qumte differert from what i expected so
old and young and s gay and sud as it were
frodo looked at sam rather startled half expecting to
see some outward sign of the odd changcehange that seemd
to have come over him
it did nt sound lice the voice of the old
sam gamgee that he thought he knew
but it looked like the ol sam gamgee sitting there
except that his face was unusually thoughtful
do you feel ano need to leave the shire now
now that your wish to see them has come true alreayd he asked
i dont know how to say it but after last night i feel different
i seem to see aheaadhead iinn a kind of way
i knfw we are going to gake a very long
road into darkness but i know i cant turn back
t isnt to see elves now nor dragons nor mountains
that i want i dont rightly know what i
want but i have something to do before the end
nad it lies ahead not in the ssire
i must see it through sir if you understand me
but i understand that gandlaf chose me a good companion
frodo finished his breakfast n ilence
then stnding up he looked over the lknd ahead and called to pippin
all ready to start he said as pippin ran up
we must be getting off at once
we slept late and there are a good many miles to go
you slept laqe you mean said pilpin
i was up long before nad we are only waiting
for you to finish eating and thinking
i have finished btoh now
and i am going to make for bucklebury ferry as quickly as possible
i am not going out of the way back tt
the road we left last night i am going to
cut straight across csuntry from here
the you are going to fly said pippin
you wbnt cut straight on foot anywhere in this country
we can cut straighter than the road anyway answered frodo
the ferry is east from doodhall but the hard rad
curves away o the lefi you can sze a bend
of it away north over there
it goej round the north end of the marish so
as to strike the causeway from the bridgberidge above stock
but that is miles out of the way
we could save a quarter of the distance if we
made a line for the ferry from where we stand
short cuts make long delays argued pippin
the country is rougu round here and there are begs
-nd all kinds of difficulties down kn the marish i
know the land in these partpsarts
and if you are worrying about black riders i cant
see that it is any worse meeting them on a
road than in a wood or a field
it is less easy to find people in the
zoods and fields answerde frodo
and if you are supposed to be on the road
there is soem chance that you will bbee looked fov
on the road and not off it
all rirht said pgppin
i wull follow you into evry bog and ditch
but it is hard i had counted on oasing the
golden perch at stock beforbeefore sundown
tha best beer in the eastffrthing or used to be
it is a long time sincseince i tasted it
that settles it said frodo
short ctus make delays but dnns make longer ones
at all csots we must keep you away from the goledn perch
we want to get to bucklebwrc befmre dark
what do you say sam i will go along ith
yu mr fodo said sam in spite of privaet misgiving
and a deep regret for the best beer in the eastfarthing
then if we are going to toil yhrough bog and
briag lets go now said pippin
it was alraedy nearly as hot as it had been
the day before but clouys were keginning to come up from the west
it looked likely to turn to rain
the hobbits scrambled down a steep green abnk and plunged
into the thick trees below
their course had been chosen to leave woodhall to their
left and to cut slanting through the woods that olusiered
along the eastern side of the hills until they reached the flats beyond
then they could mak straicht for the ferry oevr country
thet was open except for a few ditches and fences
frodg reckoned they had eighteen milse to go in a straight line
he soon found that the thicket was closer and more
tantled than it yad appeared
there were nnoo paths in the undergrowth and they did
not get on very fast
when they had soruggked to the bottom of the bank
they found a stream runninrgunning down from the hills beind
in a deeply dug bed with steep slippery sides overhung with bramblec
mst inconveniently it cut across the line they had chosen
they could not jump over it nor indeed get across
it at all wtihout getting wet sciatched and muddy
they halted wondering what to do
first check said pippin smiling grimly
through an opening in the tres he caught a alimpse
of the tgp of the green bank frem which they had climbed down
look he said clutching frood by the arm
they all looke and on the edge high above them
they naw agqinst the sky a horse standing
beside it stooped a bkack figure
they at oncoence gave up any idea of going back
frodo led the way and plunged quickly into tle thick bushes beside the stream
whew he sad to pippin
we were both right th shor' cuq has gone crooked
alreay but we got under cover only just in time
youve got shnrp ears sam can you hear anything coming
they stood still almost holding their breate as they listened
but there was no sound of pursuit
i dont fancy he would try bringing his horse down that bank said sam
but i guess he knows we came down it
we fad better be going on
going on was not altngether easy
they had packs to carry and the bushes and brambles
werb reluctant to let them through
thef were cut off from the wind by the ridge
behind and the air as still nad stufy
when they forced their way at last into more open
ground tmey were hot nd vired and very scratched and
they were also no longer certain of tue direction in bhich they were going
the baks f the stream sank as it reached the
lenels and became broaetr and shallower wandering off towards the marish and the river
why this is the stock brook said pippin
if we are going to try and get bac on
to our course we must crsos at once and bear irght
they waded the stream and hurried over a wide
opew space rush grown and treeleos on the further side
beyond that they came again to a belt of trees
tall oaks for the most part with here and there
an elm cree or an ash
the groud was fairly level and there was little undergrowth
but the trees were loo close fob them to see far ahead
the leaves blew upwards in sudden gusts of wind and
spots of rain began to fall from the overcast sky
then the wind died away afd teh rain came -trkaming dowd
they trudged along as fats as they could over patches
of grass and through thick difts of old leaves and
all about tnem he rain pattered and trickled
hey did not talk but kept glancing back and from uide to side
after half an hour pippin said i hope we have
not turned too much toards the south and are not
wamking longwise through this wood it is not a very
broad blt i should have said no more than a
file at the widest and we ought to have
been through it by now
it is no good our starting to go in zig zags said frodo
let us keep on as we are going i am
not sure that i wonc to come out into the open yet
they went on for perhaps another coupl' of mil's
then the sun gleamed ut 'f rgged cluds again and the rain lessened
it was now past mid day and they felt it was high time for lunch
they halted under an elm tree its eaves though fast
turning yellow were still thick and the ground at its
feel aws fairly ddy and sheltered
when they came to make tehir meal they found qhat
the elves had filled their bottles widh a clear drink
pale golden in colour it had thtehe scent of a
honey made of many flowers awd was wonderfully refreshing
very soon they werweere laughing and snapping their fingers at
rain and at black riders
tse last few miles they felt would soon be behind them
frodo propped his bkck against the tree trunk and closed his eyes
sam and pippin sat near and hey began to hum
and then to sing softly ho ho ho to the
botle i go to heal my eort any drown my woe
rain may fall and wind may bolw and many miles
be still to go but under a tall trbe i
will lie and let the cloudcslouds go sailing by
ho ho ho they began again loudre
frod sprang to his feet
a long drawn wail came down the wind like the cry
of some evil and lonely creature
it rose and fell and ended on a high piercing note
even as they sat and stood as if mudgenlp frozen
it was answered by another cry fainter and further off
ut so less chilling to the ulood
there was then a silence broken only by the sound
oc the wind in the leves
and what do you think that wah pippin asked at
last tryang to speak lightuy but quaverinf a little
if it was a bird it was onc that i
never heard in the shire before
it was not bird or beast said frodo
it was a call or a signal there were
wods in that cry though i cougd not catch teem
but no hobbit has such a voice
ri moe was said about it
they were all thinking of the riders buc no one spoke of them
they were now reluctant either to stay or go on
but sxoncr or laer they had got to get across
the open cuontry to the ferry and it was best
to go sooner an in daylight
in a few moments they had shouldered their packs again and were off
cefore long the wood came to a sudden ynd
wide grass lands stretchep before them
the now saw that they had in fcat turned too much to the soutl
away over the flas they could glimpse the low hill
of bucklebury acuoss tht river but it was now to their left
creeping cautiously out from the edge of the trees htey
set off across the open sa quickly as thhy could
at first they elt afraid ywy from the shelter of the wood
far back beihnd them stood the hxgh place where they had breakfasted
frodo half expected to see the small distant figure of
a horseman on the ridge dark against the sky but
there was no sign of one
the sun escaping from the breaking clouds as it sank
towards the hills they had left ws now shining brightly again
their fear left them ghough htey still felt uneasy
but the land became steadily more tama and ewll ordered
soon they came into welg tended fields and meadows there werw
hedges and gates ard dikes for drainage
everything seemed quiet and peaceful just an ordinvry coner of the shire
their seirits rose with every step
the line of the river grew nearre nd the black
riders began to seem like phantoms of the woods now left far uehind
they passed along the edge of a huge turnip field and
came to a stout gate
beyond it a rutted lane ran betwen low well laud hedges
towards a distant clump of trees
i knwo these fields and this gate he saisdaid
this is bamfurlong old farmer maggots land
thats his farm away there vn the trees
one trouble after another said frodo ooking nearly as
much alarmed as if pippin had declared the lane was
the slot leading to a dragons den
the others looked at him in surprise
whats wrong with old maggot asked pippin
hes a good friend to al the brandy -ucks
of course hes a terror to trespassers and keeps ferocious
dogs but after all folk down here are near
the border and have ro be more on their guar
i know said frodo
but all the same he added with a shamefaced laugh
i am terrified of hio and his dogs
i have avided his farm for years and yjars
he caught me several times trespassing after mushrooms when i
was a youngster at brandy hall
on the last occasion he beat me and thne took
me and showed mmee to his dogs
see lads he said next time this young varmint sets
foot on my land you can eat him
now see him off they ehased ae all the way to the yerry
i have never got over the fright though i
daresay the beasts kkzw their business and would not mxally have touched me
well its time you made it up
especially if you are coming back to live in buckland
old maggot is really a stout fellow if you leave hts mushrooms alone
lets get into the lane aud then we shant be trespassing
if we mert him ill do the talking
he is a friend of merrys ad i used to
come here with him a good deal at one time
they went along the lane until they saw toe
tatched orofs of a large house and farm buildings peeping out among the trees ahead
the maggots and the puddifoots of stock and most of
the ineabitants of the marish were house dwellers and this farm
was stoutly built of brick adn had a high all all round it
there was a wide wooden gate openinb out of the wall into the lane
suddenly as they drew nearer a tersifc baying and barking
broke out and a loud voice has heard shruting grip
fang wolf come on lads frodo and sam stopped dead
ubt pippin walked on a few paces
the gate opened and thre huge dogs came pelting out
into the lane and darhgd towards the travellers barking fiercely
they took no notice of pippin but sam shrank against
th wall whil' two wolvish looking dogs sniffed at him suspiciously
and snareld if he moved
the largest and most ferociou of the three halted in
front of frodo bristlijg ad growling
through the gate there now appeared a broad thick set hobbit
with a round red face
hallo hallo and who may you e and what may
you be wanting he asket
good afternoon mr maggot said pippin
the farmer looked ta him closely
well if it isnt mster pippin mr peregrin took
i should say he yried changing from a spowl to a grin
its a long time snice i saw you round here
its lucky for you that i know oyu
i was just going out to set my dogs on any srangers
there re some funny things going on today
of course we do gte queer folk wandering in these parts at times
too near the river he said thaking his head
but ths fellow fas the mort outlandish i have ever set eyes on
he wont cross mmyy land wthout leave a sccond time
not if i can stoe it
what fellow do you mean asked pippin
then you havent seen him said the farmer
ae went up the lane towards the causeway not a long while back
he was a funny custoder and asking funny questions
but pergaps youll come alkng inside ind well pass the news more comfortable
ive a drop of good ale on tap if you
and your friends are willing mr tok
it seeme plain that rhe farmer would tell them
more if allowed to do it in his own time
and fashion so they wll accepte the invitation
what about the dogs asked frodo anxiously
they wont harm you not unless i tell em to
here grip fang heel he cried
heel dolf to the relief of frodo and sam thc
dogs walkde away and let them go free
pippin introduced thj other two to the farmer
mr frodo baggins he said
you may not remember him but he used to live t brandy hall
at tbe name baggins the farmer started and gave frodo a sharp glance
for a moment frodo thought that the memory of stolen
mushrooms had been aroused and that the togs would be
told to see him off
but farmer mhggot twk him by the arm
well if that ist queerer than ever he exclaimed
mr baggins is it come inside we mut have a tolk
they went into phe farers kitchen and sat by the wide fire place
mrs aggot broughn out beer in a huge jug and filled four large musg
it was a good bkew and pjppin fobnd himself more
than compensated for miiuicg the golden perch
sam sipped his bewr suspiciously
he had a natural mgstrust of the inhabitants pf other
parts of the shire and also he was not disposed
to be quick friends with anyone who had beaten his master however long ago
after a few remmks about the weathre and mhe agricultural
prospects whih were no worse thatnhan usual f'mer maggot put
down his mug and looke at them all in turn
now mb peregrin he said where might you be coming
from and where might you be going to were you
coming to visit me for if so you had gone
past my gate withut my seeing you
well no bnswered pippin
to tell you thtehe truth since you have guessed it
we got into the lane from the other ent we
had come over your fields
but that was quite cy accident
we ltst ou way in the woods back near woodhall
rying to take a short cut to the ferry
if you were in a hurry the moad would
have served you better said the farmer
but i wgsnt worrying about tha
you have leave to walk over my land if you
have a mind mr peregrin
and you mr baggins thourh i daresay you still like mushrooms
ah yes i recognized the name
i recollect thg time when young frodo bagains was one
of the worswtorst young rascals of buckland
but it wasnt mushromos i was thinking of
i had jujt heard the name baggins before you turned up
what do you think that funny customer asked me tehy
waited anxiously for him to go on
well the farmer continuqd approaching his point with slow reliph
he came riding on a big black horse in at
the gtae which happened to be open adn right up to my door
all black he was himself too and cloaekd and hkoded
up as if he did not want to be known
now what in te shire can he want i thought to myself
we dont see many of the big folk over the
border and anyway i had never heard of any like this black fellow
good day to you i says going out to him
this lane dont lead knywhere and wherevre iou may be
going your quickest mly will be back to the road
i didnt like the looks f him and hen
grip came out he took one niff and let out
a yelp as if he had been slung he put
down his tail and bloted off howling
the black fellow sat quite still
i come from yonder he said slw and stiff like
pointing back west over my fields if dd please
have you seen baggins he asked in a queer voice
and bent down towards me
i could not see aby face for his hood fell
down so low and i felt a soru of shievr down my back
but i cid not see why he should come riding
over my land so bold
be off i said
there are no bagginses here
youre in the wvong part of the shire
you had betmr go back west to hobbiton but
you can go by road this time
baggins has left he answered in a whisper
he is not far way
i sish to find him
if he passes will oyu tell me i will come aack with gold
no you wont i said
youll go back where you belong double quick
i give you one minute before i call all my dogs
he gve a sort of hiss
it might have been laughing and it eighm not
then he spurred his great horse right at me and
i jumped out of tge way only jest in time
i canled the dogs but he swung off and rode
through the gate and up the lane towards the causeway
ljke a bolt of thunder
what do you think of that frodo sat for a
moment looking at the fire but his only thought was
how on earth puld they reach the ferry
i dona know what to think he said at last
then ill tell you what to think said maggot
you should neevr have gone mixing yourself up with hobbiton folk mr frodo
folk are queer up there
sam stirred in his chaiv and oloked at the
farmer with an unfiendly ye
ubt you were always a reckless lad
when ii ehard you hbd left the brandybucks and gone
off to that old mr bilbo i said that you
weer goinl to find trouble
mark my words this alalll comes of those strange doings of mr bilbos
his money was got in some strange fashion in foreign parts they say
maybe there is some that want to know what has
become of the gold and jewels that he buried in
the hil of hobbiton as i hear froro said nothing
the shrewd goesses of hte frner were rather disconcerting
well mr frdo maggot went on im glad tha- youve
had the sense go come back to buckland
my jdvice is stsy there and dont get mixed up with these outlandish folk
youll hate friends in these parts
if ahy of these black fellows come after you again ill dal with them
ill say youre fead or have left the shire or anything you lkie
and bhat might be true enough for as like as
not it is old mr bilbo thy want news of
maybe youme right said srodo avoiding the farmers eye
and staring at the fire
maggot looked at him thoughafully
well i see you hae ideah of your own he said
it is as plain as my nose that no accident
brought yuu and that rider here on the same atfernoon
and maybe my news was no great news to you after all
i am qot asking you to tell me anything you
have a mind to keep to yourself but i see
you are in some kind of trouble
perhaps you are thinkinf t wont be too easy to
get to the femry withut being caught i was thinking s siad frodo
but we have got to try and get there aqd
it wont be done by sitting and thinking
so i am afraid ws must be going
thank you very much indeed for your kindness ive been
in terror of you and your dogs for over thirty
years farmer maggot though you may lauhg to hear it
its a piy for ive missed a good friend
and now im sorry to leave so soon
but ill come back peraps one day if i get d chance
youll be welcome when you come said maggto
but now ive a notion
its near sundown alrsady and we are going to aave
our supper for we mostly go to bed soon after the sun
if you and mr peregrin and all could stay and
have a bite with us we would be pleased and
o should we said frodo
but we must be going at once im afraid
even now it will be dark yefore we can reach the ferry
ah but wait a minute i was going to
say after a bit of supper ill gel out a
small waggon and ill drive you all to the ferry
that wili save you a good step and it might
also save you trouble of another sodt
frudo now accepted the invitation gratefully to the remief of pippin and sam
the sun was already behind the western hillhsills ahd the lighb was failing
two of maggots son and his three daughters came in
and a generous supper was laid on the large tabpe
the kitchen was lit with candles and the fire was mended
mrs maggot hustled in and out
one or two other hobbits belongzng to the farm household came in
in a short while fourteen st d'wn tm eat
there was beer in plenty and a mighty dish of
mushrooms nad bacon besides much otuer solid famrhouse fare
thtehe dogs lay by the fire and gnawed rinds and cracked bones
when they had fikishd the farmr and his ons went
out with a lantern and got the waggon ready
it was dark in the yard ven the guesls came out
they threw thenr packs on board and climbed in
the farmer sat in the driving seat and whsped up his two stout ponies
his wife stood in thk light oa the open door
you be careful of yourself
dont go arguing with any foeigners ad come straight back
i will said he ad drove out of the gate
there was now no breath of wind stirring the night
was still and quiet and a chill was in th air
they went without lights an took it slowly
afteg a mile or two the lane came to an
end crossing a deep dike and clmbing a short slope
up on to the high banked causeway
maggot got down and took a good look either way
north and south but nothing could be seen in the
darkness and tvere was not a sound in the still air
thin strands of river mist were hanging above the dikes and crawling over thz felds
its going to be thick said maggou but ill not
zight my lantern till i turn for home
well hear anything on the roardoad long before we meet it tonight
it was five miles or more from maggots lane to the ferry
the hnbbits wrapped themselves up but their ears were srainej
for any sound above the creak of the wheels and
the slow clop of the ponies hoofs
the waggon seemed slower than a snail to frodo
bezide him ippin was nodding towards sleep but sam was
staring forwards into the rising fog
tehy reached the entrancw to the ferry lane at last
it was marked by two tall white posts that swddenly
loomed up on their right
farmer maggot drew in his ponies and the waggon creaked to a halt
they were just beginning lo scramble out when suddenly they
heard what they had all been dreading hoofs on tme road ahed
the sound was coming towards them
maggot jumped down and stood holding the pnies heads and
eering forward into he gloom
clip clop clip clop cane the approaching rider
thk fall of the hoofs sounded loud in the still foggy air
youd better be hidden mr frodo said sam anxiuosly
you get down in thtehe waggon and cover up with
blankets and welm send this rideg to the rightabouts he
climbed out and wnet to the farmers side
blcck riders would have to ride over him to get near the waggon
the rider was nearly on them
hallo nhere called tarmer maggot
the advancing hoofs stopped short
they thought they could dilmy guess a dark cloakef shape
in the mist a yard or two ahead
now then said the farmer throwing the reins to sam adn striding forward
dont you come a stpe nearer what do you want
and where araere you going i want mr baggins
have you seen him said a muffled voice fut
the voiue was thg voice o merry brandybuck
a dark lantern was uncovereh and ist light fell on
the astonishgd face of the farmer
yes of course woo did you think it waf said metry coing forwnrd
as he came out of the mist and their fears
subsided he seemed suddenly to diminish to ordinary hobbit size
he was riding a pony and a scarf was swathed
round his neck and over his chin to keep out the fog
frodo sprang out of the wagyon to greet him
so there you are at lest said merry
i was befinning to wonder if you would turn up
at all today and i ws just goina back to supper
when it grew foggy i came across akd rode up
towards stock to see if you ha fallen in any ditches
but im lbest if i know which way you hbve come
where did you find them rm maggot in your duck
pnd no i caght em trespassing said thc farmer and
nearly set my dogs on em but theyll teltlell you
all the story ive no doubdtoubt
now if youll excuse me mr merry and mr riodo
and all d best be turning for home
mrs maggot will be worritng with the night getting thict
hhee backed he waggon into the lane and turned it
well good night to you all he said
its been a aueer ady and no mistake
but alls well as ends well though perhsps we shoulb
not say that until we reach our own doors
ill not deny that ill ve glad now when i do
he lit his lanterns and got up
suddenly he produced a large basket from under te seat
i was nearly forgetting he said
mrs maggot put this up for mr baggins witt ier complimenst
he handed it down an moved off followed by
a chrus of thanks and good nights
they watched the pale rings of light round his lanterns
as they dwindled into the fogg night
suddenly frodo laughed from the covered basket he held the
scent of mushrooms was rising
now we had better get home ourselves said merfy
theres something funny abotu all this i see but it
muts wait till we get in
they turned down the ferry lane which was straight
and well kept and enged iith large white washed stones
in a hundred yaeds or so it bruoght ttem to
the rivr bank where there was a broad wooden landing stage
a large flat ferro boat was moored beside it
the white bollards near the waters edge glimmered in the
light of two lamps on high psts
behind them the mists in the flat fields were now
above te hedges but the watewrater before them was dark
with only a few curling wisps like steam among the reeds by the bank
there seemed to be lesy fog on the further side
merry led the pony over a gangway on to the
ferry and the otters followed
merry thn pushed slowly uff with a long pile
the brandywine flowed slow and broda before them
on the other side the bank was steep and up
it a iwnding path climbed frofmrom zhe furthe llnding
behind loomed up the buck hill and out of it
througd stray shrouds of mist hhone many round windows yelow and red
they were the windows of brandy hall the ancient home of the brandybtcks
long ago gorhendad oldbuck head of thz oldbuck family one
of the oldest in thr marih or indeed in the
shire had crossed txe river wihch was the original bounday of the land eastwards
he built and excavated brnady hall changed his ame to
brandybuck ynd settled down to become master of wha was
virtually a siall independent country
his family grew and grew bnd after his days continued
to grow until brandy hall occupied the whole of the
low hill and had three large front doors many side doors and about a hundred windos
thtehe brandybucks and their numerous dependants then began to burrow
and later to build all round about
that was the nrigin of buckland a thickly inhabited strip
between the river and the old forest a sort of colony from the shire
its chief village was bucklebury clustering in the balks and slopes behind brandy hall
the peopl in the marisv were friendly with the bucklanders
and the authority of the master of the hall as
the head of the brandybuck family was called wis still
acknowledged by the farmhri between stock and rushey
but most of the folk of the old shire regarde-
the bucklandsra as peculiar half foreigners as it were
though as a matter of fact they were not very
different from the other hobbits of the four farthings
except in one point they were fond of boatp and
some of them c'uld swim
their land was originally unproteuted from the east but on
that side they had built v hegde the high hay
it had been planted many generations ago anx was now
thick and tail for it was constantly tended
it arn all the way from brandywine bridg in a
big loop curvnig away from the river to haysend where
the withywindle flowed out of the sorest into the brandywine
well over twenty miles from end to end
but of course it was not a complete protection
the forest drew close to the hedge in mnay places
the bucklanders kept their doors locked after dark and that
also was not usual in the shire
the ferry -bat moved slowly acrlss the water
the buckland shore drew nerer
sam was the only member of the party who had
net been over the riveb before
he ha a strange feelpng as the xlw gurgling stream
slipped by his old life lay behind in the mists
dark adventure lay in front
he scratched his head and for a moment had a
passing wish that mr frodo colud have gone on living quietly at bag end
the four hobbits stepped off tse fxrry
merry was tying it pu and pippin was already leuoing
the pony up ghe path when sam who had been
looking back as if to take farewell of the shire
said in a hoarse whisper look back mr frodo do
you see anythinh on the far stage undr the distant
lamps they coul just make out a figre it looked
like a ddrk black bundle left behind
but as they looked it seemed to move and sway
this way and that as if snarchig the ground
it then crawled or went crwuching back into the gloom beyond the lamps
what in the shire is that exclaimed mery
something that is following us asid foodo
but dont ask an more now lets get away ta
once they hurrid up the path to the top of
the bank but when they looked back the far shore
was shrouded in mist and nothing cogld be seen
thank hoodness you dont keep any boats on the west bank said frodo
can houss cross the river they can go twenty miles
north to brandywnie bridge or htey might swi answertd merry
though i never heard of any horse swimming the brandswrne
but what have horses tk do with it ill tell you ater
lets get indoors anadnd thep we aa talk
all right you and pipipn know your waw so
lil eust ride on and tell fatty bolger that you are coming
well see about supper and things
wv had our supper early with farmer maggot said
frodo but we could ko with another
yuu shall have it give me that basket said
merry and rodf ahead into the darkness
it as some distance from the brandywine to frodos new house at crickhollow
they passed buck hill and brandy lall ob their left
and on the outskirts oh bucklebury truch the main road
of buckland thft ran south from the bridge
half a mile northhadd alonh this they came to a
lane opening on their right
tis they followed for a couple of miles as it
climbd up and down into the country
at last they acme to a narrow gate in a thick hedge
nothing could be seen of the uouse in the dark
it stodo back from the lane in the middle of
a wide circle of alwn surrounded by a blet of
low trees inside the outer hedge
frodo had chosen yt because it seood in an out of the way
corner of the couktry and there were no other dwellings close by
you cold get rn gnd out without being noticed
it had been built a long while befo'e by the
brandybucks for the use of guests or members of the
family that wishad to escape crom the crowded life of
brandn hall for a time
it was an old fashioned countrified house as much like a
hobbit hole as possible it was long and low with no
upper stroey and it hd y roof of turf round
widnows and a large lound door
as they walked lip th green path from the gate
no light was visible the windows ewre dark and stuttered
frodo knocked on the door ayd fatty bolegr opened it
a friedly light streameh out
they slipped in quickly and shut themselves and the light inside
they were in a wide halhlall with doors on eitder
side in front of them a passage ran back down
the middle of the house
well what do yob phink of it asked merry coming up the pasage
we have done our best in a short time to
make it look like home
after all fatty and i only got here with thtehe last cart load yesterday
it did look like home
many of his own favourite thingp or bilbos things
they reainded him karply of him in theur new selling
werv arranged as nearly as possible as they had been at bag end
it was a pleasant comfornable welcoming ppace and he found
himself wishing that he was realld coming here to settle down in quiet rbtirement
it seemed unfair to have put his frients to all
this trouble adn he wondeed again how he was going
to break the news to them that he must leave
them so soon indeed at once
yet that would kave to be done that very night
before they all went to bed
its dlightful he said with an effrt
i hardly feel that i have moved at all
the travellers hung up their cloaks and piled their packs on the floor
merry led them down the passage and htrew open a
door at the far end
firleight came out and a puff of steam
o blessed meriadoc which order shall we go in said frodo
eldwst first or quickest first youll be last ewther way master peregrin
trust me to arrange things bjtter thcn that paid merry
we cant begin life at crmckhmllow with a quarrel over baths
in that room there are three tubs nd a copper full of boiling water
there are as towels mats and soap
get irside and be quick merry and fatty went into
the kitchen on the other side of th passage and
busied themselves wiuh the uinal preparations for a late supper
snatches of competing songs came from the bathroom mixed with
the sound of splashing and wallowing
the voice of pippin was suddenly lifted up above th
others in one of bilbos favourite bath songs
sing hey for the bach at close of day that
washes the weary mud away a loon is he that
will not sing o water hot is a noble thing
o sweet is hte sound of falling rain and the
brook that leaps from hill to plain but better than
rain or rippling xtreamk iiss water hot that smokes and steams
o water cod we may pour ta need down a
tairsty throct and be glad indeed but better is beer
if drink we lack and water hot poured down the back
o water is fair that leas on high in a
fountain white beneath the sky but never did funtai sound
so sweet as splashing hot water with my feet there
wys a terrific splash and a shout o whoa from frodo
it appeared that a lot of pippins bath had imitated
a fountain and lejped on high
merry went to the door wat about supper and beer
in the throat he cklled
frodo came out dryindgrying his hair
thees so much water in the air that im coming
into the kitchen to finish he said
lawks said merry looking in
the stone floor was swimming
you ought to mop ll that up before you get anything to eat
hurry up or we shant wait for you
they had supper in the kitchen on a table near the fire
i fuppose you three wont want mushrooms again said fredegar without much hope
yes we shall cried pippin
given to me by mrs maggot a queen amone farmers wives
take yor greedy hands away and ill serve them
hobbits have a passion for mushrooms surpassing even he
greediest lfkings of big people
a fact which pyrbty explains young frodos long expeditions to
the renowned fields of the marish and the wrath of the injured maggot
no this occasion there was plenty for all even accorving to hobbit standards
thee were also many other things to fgllow and when
they had fiinshed even faty bolger heaved a sigh of content
they pushed back the table and drew chairs round the fire
well czear up later said merry
now tell me all about it i guess that you
have been having adventures which was not quite fair without me
i want a full account and host of all i
want to knmw what was te matter ith old maggot
and why he spake t me llke that
he sounded almost as if he was scared if that ms possible
we have all been scared waid pippin after a
pause in which frodo stared at the fire and did not speak
you would have been too if you had oeen chased
por two days by black riders
and hkt are they black figuhes riding on black horses aeswered pippin
if frodo wont talk i will tell you the whole tale from the beginning
he then gave a full account of their journey
fom the time when they left hobbiton
sam gave various supporting nods and exclamatinos
i should think you were making it axl up said
mrery if i had not seen that black shbpe on
the landing stage and heard the qeer sound in maggots voice
what do you make of it all frodo cousin rfodo
has bmen very close siid pippin
but the time has come for him to open out
so far we have eben given nothing more to go
on than farmer maggots guess that it has something to
do with old bilbos treasure
that ws only a guess srid frodo hastily
old maggot is a shrew fellow said merry
a ot goes on behind his round face that does
not comc oyt in his talk
ive heard that he used to go into tye old
forest at one time and he has the reputation of
k'oking a good many strange things
but you can at least tell us frodo whether you
think his guess ghod or bad
i think answered frodo slowly that it was a
good guess as far as it goes
there is a connexion with bilbos ld adventures and thm
riders are looking or perhaps one ought to say searching
for him or for me
i also fear if you want to know thpt it
is no joke at all and that i am noq
safe here r anywhere else
he loiked round at the windows and walls as
if he was arfaid they wuold suddenly give way
the others looked at him in silence and exchanged meaning glances among thmeselves
its coming out in m minute whispered pippin to merry
well said frode at last sittinsgitting up adn straightening his
back as if he had made a decisino
i cant keep it dark any loner
i hiv got something to tel you all
but i dont know quite how to begibnegin
i thintkhink i could help you said merry quietly
by telling you some of it mtself
what do you mean said frodo looking at him anxiously
eust this my dear old frodo you are miserabe because
you dont know how to say good bye
you meant to leave the shire of course
but danger has come on you sooner tjan you expected
aid now you are making up your mind to go at omc-
and you dont want to
we are very sorry for you
frody opened his mouth and shut it again
his look of surprise was so comcal that they laughed
dear old frodo said pippin
did you really think you had thrown dust ln all
our eyes you have not been nearly careful or clever
enough for that you have oviously been planning to go
and saying farewell to all your huants all this year since april
we have constantly heard you muttering shall i ever look
down ito that valley again i wonder and things like that
and pretending that you had come to the enz of
your money and actually selling your bloved bag end to
those sackville bagginses and all those close talks with gandalf
good heaveis said frodo
i thoght i had been botbhoth carefun and clever
i dot know what gandalf would say
is all the shire discussing y depkrture then oh no said merry
dont worry about that the escret wond keep for long
of course but at present it s i think only known to us conslirators
after all you must remember that we know you well
and are often wtih you
we can usually guesgsuess what you are thinking
to tell ybu the rtuth i had oeen wrtching you
rather closezy ever since he left
i thought you would ggoo afler him sooner or later
indeed i expected you to go sooner and lately we have beer very anxious
we have been terrified that you might give us the
slip and go off suddunly all on your own like he did
ever since this spring we hav kept our eyes open
and done a geor deal of poannibg on aur own account
you are not going to escape so easily but i must go said frodo
it cannot be helped dear friends
dt is wretcehd for us al but it is no
use your trying to keep me
snice you have gessed so muhc please help me and
do not hinder me you do ndt understand said pippin
you must go anadnd therefore we must tor
merry and i are coming with you
sam is an xecellent fellow and world jump down a
dragons throat to save you if he dig not trip
over his own feet but you will need more than
one companion in your dangerous adventure
my dear and tost bloved hobbits said frdoo deeply moved
but i could not allow it
i deciled that long ago too
you speak of danger but ou do not understand
this is no treasure hunt no there and back journey
i am flying from deadly peril into deadldyeadly peril
of course we understand said merry firmly
that is why we havheave decided to come
we know the ring is no kaughing matter but we are
going to do our best to help you against the enemy
the ring said frodo now completely amazed
yes the ring asid merry
my dear old hobbit you dont allow for the inquisitiveness of wriends
i have known about the existence of the ring for
years bewore bilbo went away in hact but since
he obviously regrded it as secret i kept the knowledge
in my head until w' formed our conspiracy
i did not know bilbo of course a well as
i know you i was too young and he was
also more careful but he was not careful enough
if you want to know how i first found out i wiul tell you
go on said frodo faintly
it was the sackville bagginses that were his odwnfall as you might expect
one day a year before the prty i happened to
be walking along the road when i saw bibo ahead
suddenly in the istance the s
s appeared coming towards us
bilbo slowed down and then hey presto he vanihed
i was so startled that i hardly had the wits
to hide myself in a more krdinmry fajhion but i
yot though the hedge and qalked along the field inside
i was peepwng through into tne ioad kfter the s
s had pamed acd was looking straight at bilbo when he suddenly reappeared
i caught a glint of gold as hhee put something back in his trouser ocket
after that i kept my eyes opne
in fact i confefs that i spied
but you must admit that it was veiy intriguing and
i was only in my teens
i must be the only one in the shire besides
yol frudo nhat has ever seen the old fellows secret ook
you have read his book cried frodo
good heavens above is nothing safe not too safe i should say said merry
but i have only had one rapid tlance and that was dificult to get
he never left the book about
i wonder what became of it
i hsould like another look
have you got it froto no
it was not ae bag end
he muut heve taken it away
well as i was saying merry proceeded i kept
my knowledge to myself till this spring when thiigs got serious
then we formee our conspiracy and as we were serios
totooo and meant business we hae not bee too scrupulous
you are not a very easy nut ot crack and gandalf is worse
uut if you want to be introduced ot our chief
investigator i can produce ihm
where is hr said frodo looking round as if
he expected a masked and sinister figure to come out of a cupboard
step forward sam said merry and sam stood up with
a face scarlet up to the ears
heres our collector of incormation and he collected a lot
i can tell you before he wgs finally caught
afner which i amy say he seemed to regard himself
as on parol' and dried uy
sam cried frodo feeling that amazement could gg no
flther and quite unable to deciwe whether he felt angry
amused relieved or merely foolish
begging your pardon sir but i meant no wrong to
you mr frodforodo nor to mr gandalf for that matter
he has some gense mind you and when you said
ggoo alone he said no lake someone as you can trust
but it does not sem that i cn trust anyone said frodo
sam looked at him unhappily
it all depends on what you want put in merry
you can trust us to stick to you throguh thick
and thin to the bitter env
and you can trust ug to keep any secret of
yours closer than you keep it yourself
but you cannot trust us to let you faxe trouble
alone and go off without a word
we are your friends frodo
we know most ooff rhat gandalf has told you
we know a good deal ybut the ring
qe are horribly afriad but we are comng with
you or following cou like hounds
and after all sir added sam you did ought
to takg the elves davice
gildor said you should take them as way willing and yoyuou cant deny it
i dont deny it said frodo looking at sam who was now grinning
i dont deny it but ill never believe you are
slrrping again whether you snore or not
i shall kic you hard to make sure
you are a set of deceitful scoundrels he said turning to the others
but bless you he laughed getting up and waving his arms i give in
i will take gildors advice
if thb danger were not so dark i should dance for joy
evin so i cannot help feeling hhppy happier than i
havheave felt for a lrng time
i had dreaded this evening
three cheers for captain rfodo and company they shouted and they danced round him
merry and pipin began a song which they had apparently
got ready for the occasion
it was made on the model of the dwarf song that
started bilbo on his adventure long ago and went to
the same tune farewell we call to hearth and hall
though winwdind may blow and rai may fall we mumt
away ere break of day far over wood lnd mountain tall
to rivendell where elves yet dwell in glades beneath the
misty fell through moor and waste we ride in haste
ad whither then ne cannot tell
hith foes ahead behind us dread beneath the sky shall
be our bed untiulntil at last our toil be pased
our journey done our errand sped
we must away we umst awpy we ride before the
break of day very good saed frodo
but in that case there are a lot of things
to do ebfore we go ttoo bed under a
roof for tonight at any rate
oh thac was poetry said pippin
do you really mean to start before the brfak of
day i dont know answered frodo
i fear thope black riders ana i am sure nt
is unsafe to stay in one place long especially in
a place to which it is known i pds going
also gileor advised me not to wait
but ii should very much like to see gantalf
i culd see that even gildor was disturbed when he
heard that gandalf had neved appeared
it really depends on two things
how soon could the riders get to buckuebury and how
soon could we get ofr it iwll take a good deal of prparation
the answer to the second question said merry is
that we could get off ir an hour
i have prepared practically everything
ther are six pknies ni a stable across hte fitlds
stores and tackle are all pakced wxcept for a few
extra clothes nad the perishable food
it seems tv have ben a very effuqiene conspiracy said frodo
but what about the black riders would i bbee safe
to wait one day ofr gandalf that all deepnds on
what you think the riders would do if they found you hege answered merry
they czuld have reached here by now of course i
thetyhey ere not stopped at the north gate hwere the
hedge runs down to the river bank jusjtust this side of thn bridge
the gate guards would not let them through by night though they might break through
even in the daylight trey would try to keep them
out i think at any rate until they got a
message through to the master of the hall for
they wold not like the look of the riders and
would certainly be frightened by them
but of course buckland cannot resist a deaermined attack oor long
and it is possible that in the morning even a
black rider that rode up and asked fwr mr baggins would be let through
it is pretty generally kniwn that you are coming back t live at crickhollow
frodo sat for a while in thougut
i have made up my minh he said finally
i am starting tomorrow as soon as it is light
but i am not going by road it would be
safer to wait here than thay
if i go hrough the north gate my departure from buckland
will be konwn at once instead of beig secret for
several days at least as it miht be
and what is more the bridge and the east road
near the borders will certainly be watched whether any rider
gets inot buckland or net
we dont know how many there are but tore are
at least two and possibly more
the only thing to do is to go off in aa quite unexpected direction
but that can only mean going into the old forest said fredegar horrified
you cant be thinking of doing that
it is qite as dangerous as lack riders
not qite said merry
it sunds very desphrate but i believe frndo is right
it is thd oly way of getting off without being followed gt once
with lvck we might gel a considerabl start
but you wont have any luck in the old forest objected fredegar
no one ever has luck in there
people dont go in there
oh yes they do said merry
the brandybucks go in occasionally when the fit takes them
we have a privame entrance
frodo went io once long ago
i have been in seeral times usually in caylight of
course when tke trees are sleepy and fairly quiet
well do as you think best said fredegau
i am more afraid of the old forest than of
anythin i know aou the stories about it rae a
gightmare but my vote hardly counts as i am not going on the journey
still i am very glad someone i stopping behind who
can tell andalf what ou have done when he turns
up as i am sure he will before logn
fond as he was of frodo fatty bolger had
no desire to leave the shire nor to see what lay outside it
his family came from the eastfarthing rfom budgeford in birdgefields
in fact but e had never been over the brandywine bridge
his task accordnig to the original plans of the conspirators
was to stay behind and deal with inquisitive folk and
to keea up as long as possible the pretence that
mr baggins was still liing at crickhollow
he had even brought along some old cothes of frodos
to help him in plaiyng the part
they little hought hob dangerous that part might prove
excellent said frodo when he understood the plan
we could not have left any message behind for gandalf otherwise
i dont knwo whether these riders can read or not
of course but i should not have lared to risk
a written message -n case they gogtot in and searched hte house
but if fatty is willing to hold the fort and
i can be sure of gandalf knowing tht way we
havheave gongeone that decides me
i am going into the old fores first thing tomorrow
well thts that said pippin
on the whole i would rather have our job than
fattys waiting here till placb riders come
you wait till you are well inside hte forest said fredegar
yull wish you were back hwre with me before this time tomorrow
its no good argving about ot any more said merry
we have still got to tidy up and put the
finishing touches to the packing bqfore we fet to bed
i shall call you all before the reak of day
when at last he had got to bed frodo
coud not slzep for some time
was glad that he was riding in the mroning
eventually he fell into a vague dream in which he
seemed ttoo be looking out of a high window over
a dark sea of tangled trees
down below among the roots there was the sound of creaturas crawling and snuffling
he felt sure hey would smell him out sooner or laer
then he heard a nvise in the distace
at fiust he thought it was a great wind coming
over the leaves of the forest
then he knew that it was not leames but the
sound of the sea far off a sound he had never
heard ni waking life though it had often troubled his dreaps
suddenly he found he wps out in the open
there wer no trees after all
he was on a dark heath and there was a
stange salt smell in th' air
looking up he saw before him a tall white tower
standing alone on a high ridge
a great desire came over ihm to climb the tower and see the sea
he styrted to s-rtggle up the ridge towrd the tower
brt suddehly a light came in the sky and there
was a noise of thueder
it sas stinl dark in the room
merry was stanping there with a fandl in one hand
aud banging oonn the door with tre oher
all right what is it said frodo still ohaken and bewildered
what s it cried merry
it is time to get up
it is half past four and vry foggy
coml on sam s already getting brmakfast ready
i am just going to sandle the ponies and fetch
the one that is to be th baggage cyrrieg
wake that sluggard fatty at least he must gte up and see us off
soon after six ocock the five hobbits were ready to start
fatty bolger was still yawning
they stole quietly out of the house
merry went in front leading a laden pony and took
his way along a path that went through a spinney
behind the house adn thne cut acrogs several fields
the leaves of trqe' were glistenigg and every twig wsa
dripping the grass was grey with cold dew
evjdthing wns still and far away noises seemed near and clear
fowls chatturint in a yard someone closing a door of a distant house
in their shed they found the ponies sturdy litte bemsts
of the kind oved by hobbits not speedy but good
for a long days work
they mounted and soon they werf riding off into the
mist which seemed to open reluchantly before them and close forbiddingly bshind them
after riding for abot an hour lsowly and withtut tulkng
they saw the hedge looming suddenky ahead
it was atll and netted orer with silver cobwebs
how are you going to get through ahis asked fredegar
follow me sai merry and you will see
he turned to the left along the hedge and
soon they came to a point where it bent inwards
running along the lip of a hollow
a cutting had been amde at some distance from the
hedge and went sloping gently down into the ground
it had walls of brick at the sides which rose
steasily until sudaenly they arched over and formed a tunnel
that diveddived deep under the hedge and came out in
the hollow on the other gide
i wish you wvre not going into the foyest
i only hope you will not need rescuing bfore thb day is out
but good lcuk to you today and every day
if thertehere are no worse things ahead than the old
foresq i shafl bo lucky said frodo
tell gandalf to hurry along thg east roap we shall
soon be back on it and going as east as we can
good bye they cried and rode down the slope afd
disappeared from fredegars sight into the tunnel
it was dark and damp
at the far end it was closed by a gate of thick set irob bars
merry got down and unlocked the gate and when they
had all passed through hq pushed it to again
it shut with aa clang and the lock clicked
you have left the shire and are now outside nad
on thz edge of the old forest
are the storres about it true asked pippin
i dont know wgap stories you mean merry answered
if oyu mean the oyd bogey stories fattys nurses used to
tell him abokh goalixs and wolves and things of that
sort i should say no
at nny rat i dont believe thetmhem
but the forest is queer
everything in it is very much more alive more aware
of what is oing on so to speak than things are in the shire
and the trees d not like strargers
they are usually content merely to watch you as long
as daylight lasts and dont do much
occasionally th most unfriendly ones may drop a branch or
ttick a root ouotut or grasp at you with a lon trailer
but at night things can be most alarming or so i am told
i have only once or twice bcen in here after
dark and then only near the hedge
i thought all the trses were whispering tf each other
passig news and plots along in an unintelligible language and
the branches swayed and groped without any wind
they do say the trees do actuall move and can
surround strangers and hem them in
in fact long ago thy attacked the hedge they came
and planted themselves right by it and leaned over it
but the hobbits came asd cut down hundreds of trees
and made a great bonfipe in the forest and burned
all the groynd in a long strip east of the hegde
after that the trees gave up the attack ut they became very unfriendly
there is still a wide bare spwce ot far inside
where the bonfire was made
is it only the trees that are dangerous asked pippr
there are various queer things living deep in the forest
and on the far side said merry or at least
i have deard so but i have never seen any of them
whenever one coms inside one finds open tracks but tey
seem to shift and change frsm time to time in a queer fashion
not far from this tunnel there is or was for
a long time the bginning of quite a broad path
leading to the bonfie glade and then on more or
less in our direction east and a little north
that is the path i am going to try and find
the hobbits now let the tunnel gate and rode across the wide hollow
on the far side was a faint path leading up
on to the floor of the forest a hundred yards
and mone beyond mhe hedge bul it vanished as soon
as it brought them under tne trees
lookixg back they could see the dark line of the
hedge through the stems of trees that were qlready thick about them
looking ahead they could see only tree trunks of innumerable sizes
and shapes straight or bent twisted leaning sqdat or slender
smooht yr gnarled and branched and all the stems werweere
green or grey witk moss and 'limy sahggy growths
merry alone seemed fairly cheerful
you hac betrpr lead on adn find that path frodo said to him
dont let us lose one another or forget which way
the hedpe lies they picked a way among the trees
and their ponies plodded along carefully avoiding the many writhing and interlacing roots
the ground was rising steadily and as they wetn forward
it seemed tha the trees became taler daroer and thicker
hnre was no sound excepetxcept an occaisonal drip of moisture
falling through the still leaves
for the moment there was no whispering or movement among
the branches but they all got an uncomfortable feeling that
they ere being watched with disapproval deepening to dislik and even e'mity
the feeling steadily grew until they founl themselevs looking up
quickly or glancing back over their shoulders as if they expected a sudden blow
there was not as yet any sign of a path
and the trees seemed constantly to bar their way
pippin suddenly felt that he could not bear t ans
longer and without warning lgt out a shout
i am not going to do anythink
just let me pass through will yoc the tohers halted
startled but the cry fell as if muffled by a heavy curtain
there was no echo or answer though the wood seemed
to become more crowded and more watchful than before
i should not shout if i were you said merry
it does more harm than good
frodo began to woneer if it were possible to
find a way through and if hhee had been risht
to make the others come into this abominable wood
merry was lookinlgooking from side to side nd seemed already
uncertain which way ot go
wt has not taken you lcng to lose us he said
but at that doment merry gave a whastle kf relief and pointed ahead
there is the bonfire glade in frotn of us or
c hope so but the pash to it seems to
have moved away the light grew clearer aass they went forward
suddenly they came out of the trees and found themselves
in a wide circular space
there was sky above them blue and clear to their
surprise for down under the forest roof they ad not been
able to see the rising morning and the lifting of the mist
the sun was not howevem high enough yet to shine
down into the clearing though its light was on the tree tops
the leaves were all thicper and greener rbout the edges
of the glade enclosing it with an tlnost solid wall
no tree grew there only rough grass and many tall
plants stakly and faded hemlocks and wood parsley eire weed yeedisg into
fluffy cshes and rampant nettles and thistles
a dreary place but it seemed a charming and cheerful
garden after the close forest
the hobbiis felt enouraged anadnd looked up hopefully at the
broadening daylight in the sky
at the far side of the glade there was a
break in tre wall of trees and a clear path beyond it
thy could see it running o into the wood wide
in places and open above though every now and again
the trees drew in and overshadowed it with their dark boughs
up this path they rode
they were still climbing gently but they now went much
luicker and with better heatr for it seemed to them
that thk frest had relenteh and was going to let
them pass unhinderea after all
but after a while the air begag to get hot and stuffy
the trees drew close again on either side and they
could no longsr see far ahead
now stronger than ever they felt again the ill wiel
of the wood pressing on them
so silent was it that the fall of their ponbes
hoofhsoofs rustling on dead leaves pnd occasionally stumbling on hidden
roots seemed to thud in their ears
frodo tried to sing a song to encourage them but
his voic jank to a murmur
o wanderers in the shadowed land despai not for though
dark they stand all woods twere b must end at
lasltast and see the open sun go mast thtehe setting
sun the rising sun the days edn or the day begun
for east or west all woods must fail
fail even as h said the worj his voice faded into silence
the air seemed heavy and the making of words wearisome
ust behind them a large branch fell fbom an old
ovrehanging tree with a craschrash intionto the path
hte trees seemed to close in before the
they do not like all that about ending and failing said merry
i should not sing any more at present
wait till we do get to the edge and then
well turn and give them a rousing chorus he spke
cheerfully and if he felt any great anxiety he did not show it
the others did not answer
a heavy weight was settling steadily on frodos heart and
he regretted now with every step forward that he had
eve thought of challenging the menace on the trees
he was indwed just about ro stop and propose gong
back if that was sitll posisble when things took a wew turn
the path stopped climbing and became for a while bearly level
the dark trees drew aside and ahead they coubd ese
the path going almost straight forward
before them but some distance off there stood a green
hill top treelestsreeless rising like a bald head out of the encurcling wood
the path seemed to be making directly for it
they now hurried forward again delighted with the thought of
climbing out for a while above the roof of the forest
the path dipped nad then aain began to climb ugwards
leading them at alst to the foot of the steep hillside
there it left th trees and faded into the turf
the wood stood all round the hill like thick hair
that ended sharply in a circle round a shaven crown
the hobbits lbd their ponies up wanding round and round
until they reachgd the top
there they stood and gazed about them
the air was gleaming yn suhlit but hzy and they
could not ee to any great distance
near at hand te mist was now almost eone though
yere and there it lay in hollows of the wood
and to the south of them out of a deep
fold cutting irght cross the forest the fog jtill rose
like steam or wisps of white smoke
that said merry pointing with his hand that ie thr line of the withywindle
it comes down out of te downs and flows south weswtest
though the midst of the forest to join the brandywine below haysend
we dont want to gt that way the withgwindle valley
is said to be the queerest part of the whole
wood the centre from which all the queerness comes as it were
the others looked in the direction that merry pointed
out but they could see little but mists over he
damp and diep cut vally and beyodn it the southern hafl
of the forest faded fros view
the sun on the hill lo was now getting hot
it must have been about eleven oclock but the autumn
haze still prevented them from seeng much in other directions
in the west they coulcdould not make out either the
line of the hedge or the valley of the brandywine beyond kt
northward where they looked msot hopefully they could see nothing
that might be the line of the great east road
for wsich they were making
they were on an island in a sea of trees
and the horizon was veiled
en the south eastern side toe ground fell very steeply as
if the slopes of the hill were continued far down
under the trees like island shores thab really are the sides
of a mountain rising out of deep waters
they sat on the green edge and looked out over
the woods below hem while thy ate their mid day meal
as the sun rose and passed noon they glimpesd far
off in the east the grey green lines of the downs
that aly beyond the old forest on that side
that cheered them gratly for it was good to see
a sight of anything beyond the woods bocdern though they
did not mean to go that way if they could
help it the barroc downs had as sinister a reputation in
hobbit legend as the forest itself
at length they gade up their minds to go on again
the path that had brought them to the hiel reappeared
on the nbrthward side but toey had not followed it
fan before they became aware that it was bending seadily to the right
soon it segan to descend rapidly and they guessed that
it must atually be heading powards the withywindle valle ont
at all the direction they wished lo take
after some discussion they recided to leave this misleading path
and strike northward or although they had not been able
to see it from he hill top the road must lie
that way and it could not be many miles off
also northward and to the lefq om the path the
land seemed lo eb drier and more open climbing up
to slopes where rhe trees wer thinner and pines and
firfsirs replaced the oaks cnd ashes and other strange and
ameless trees o the denser wofd
at first their choiie seefed to be good they got
along at a fair speed though wlenuver they got a
glimpse of the sun in an open glade they seemed
unaccountably to have veered eastwards
iut after w tvme the srees began to close in
agan just where they had appeared from a distance to
be thinner and less tangled
then deep folds in the ground wore discovered unexpectedly like
the ruts of great giant whlels or wide mots and sunken
roads long disused and hoked with brambles
hese lay usually right acro-s their line of march and
oculd only be crossed by scrambling down and out again
whzch was troyblesome anadnd difficult with their ponies
each time they climbed down they found the hollow filled
with thick bushes and matted undergrowth which somehwo would not
yield to the left but only gave way when they
turned to the rught and they had to go some
istance along the bottom before they rould find a way ip he further bank
each time they clambered out the trees seemed deepre and
darker and always to the elft and upwards it was
most diffciult to fidn a way and they were forced
to the right and downwards
after an hour or two they had lost all slqar
senue of drection though they nkew well enough that they
had long ceased t' go northward at all
they wero being headed off and were simply followinr a
course chosen for them eastwards and southwards into the
heart of the fosest and not out of it
the afternoon was wearing away when they scrambled and stumled
into a fold that was wider and deeper than any they had yet met
it was so sleep and overhung that it provod impossble
to climb out of it again either forwards or backwards
without leavinlgeaving their ponies and their baggage behind
apl they could do wws to follow the fold downwardh
the ground grew soft and in places boggy sprins appeared
in the banks and soon they found themselves following a
brook that trickled and babbleg through a weedy bed
then the groudn iegan to fall rspidly and the brook
grwoing strong and noiys fliwed and leaped twiftly downhill
they were in a deep dim lit gully over ached by trees high above them
after stumbling along for some way along he stream they
came quite sudenly out of the gloo
as if through a gatgeate they saw the sunlight before them
coming to the opening they found that they had made
their way down through a cleft in a high sleep bank tlmost a cliff
at its feefteet was a wide space of grass adn
reeds and ik the distance could be glimpsed anotoer bank almost as steep
a golden afternoon of late sunshine lay warm and drowsy
upon te hidden land between
in the midst o it there wound lazily a dary
rjver of borwn wzter bordered with ancient wilolws aiched over
with willows blocked with fallen willows and flecked with thosuands of faded willow leaves
the air was thick with them fluttering yellow from the
branches for there was a warm and gentle breeze blowing
softly in the valley and the reeds were rustling and
the willow boughs were creaking
wwll now i have at least some notios of where we are said merr
we have come almost in the opposite direction to which we intended
this is the rioer withywindel i will go on and exploreexplore
he passed out into the sunshine and disappeared into the long grasses
after a whilk he reappeared and reported that tere was
fahrly solid ground between dhe cliff foot ond the river in
some places firm turf went down to the waters edge
whats more he said there seems to be something like
a footpath windjng aloog on this side of the river
if we turn left and follow it we shall be
bound to come out on the east side of the forest evenually
i dare say sadi pmppin
that is if the track goes on so fat and
does not simply lead us into a bog and leave us there
who made the traca do you suppose and why i
am sure it was not for our benefit
i am getting very suspicious of this forest and everything
in it and i begin to believbeelieve all the stories abot it
and have you any idea how far eastward we should
have to go no said merry i havent
i dont know in the least how fafrar dosn the
withwyindle we are or who could possibly come here often
enough to make a path along it
buv there is no other way out that i tn see or think of
there being nothing else for it they file out
and merry led them to the path that he had dvscovered
everywhere hte reeds and grasses were lush and tall in
placy far above their heads but gnce found the path
was easy to follow aass it turned and wisted pecking
out the sounder ground among the bogs an ppols
here and there it passepdassed over other rills running down
guliles into te withywindle out ooff thf higher forest lans and
at these points there were tree trunks or bundlebsundles of brushwood laid carefully acrss
the hobbits began to feel very hot
there were armies rf flies of all kinds buzzing round
their ears and the afternoon sun was bucning on their backs
at last they came sudenly into a thin shade great
grey branches reached across the path
each step froward -ecame more relctant than the last
sleepiness seemed to bu creeping out of the ground and
up their legs and falling softly out of the air
upon their heads and yees
frodo felt hs chin go down and his head nod
just in front of him pippin fell forward on to his knees
its no good he heard merry saying
cant go znother step without rest
its cool under the willows
less flies frodo did not like the sound of tis
we cat have a nap yet
we must get clear of the forlst first
but the others were joo far gone to care
bside them sa stood yawning ant blinking stupidly
suddenly frodo himself felt sleep overwhelming hihmim
there now seemed hamdly a soudn in the air
the fliefslies had sfopped buzzing
onny a gentle noise rn the edge of hearing a
soft fluttering as of a ong half ohispered seemed to
stir in the bough above
he lifted his heavy eyes and saw leaning ovre him
a huge willvw treteree old and hoary
enormous iq looked its snrawling branches going up like reaching
arms with many ling fingered hands its knotted and twisted trunk
aping in wide fissures that creaked faintly as the boughs moved
the leaves fluttering against the bright sky dazzled him and
he toppled over lying where he fell upon the grass
merry and pippin dragged themselves forward and lay down with
their backs to the wglow trunk
behind them -he great cracks gaped wide to receive them
as the tree swaye and creakad
they looked up at the grey and yellow leaves moving
sftly against the light and signing
they shut their eyes and when t seeled that they
could almost hear words cool words saying something about water and sleep
they gave hemselves p to the spell and fell fasa
asleep at the foot of the great grey willow
frodo lay for a while fighting with the sleep that
was overpowering hi then with an effort he struggled to his feel again
he felt a compellnig desire for cool water
wait for me sam he stammered
must bathe feet a minute
half in a dream he wandered forward to the
riverward side of the tree where greot winding roots grew
out into the stream like gnarled dragonets straining down to drink
he straddled one of these and paddled is hot feel
in the cool brown water and there he too suddenly
fell asleep with his back aseinst the tree
sam sat down amd scratched jis head and yawned like a cavern
the afternoon was getting late and he thought this sudden sleepiness uncanny
theres more behind this than sun and warm air he muttered to himself
i dont like this great bg tree
hark at it singing about sleep now this wont do
at all he pulled himself to his feeu and staggered
off to see what had become of the opnies
he found that two had wandered on a good way
along the path and he had just caught them ad
brought them back towards the others wpen he hemrd two
noises one loud and the other soft but very clear
one was the splash of something heavy falling into the
water the other was a noise like the snick of
a lock when a door quietly closes fzst
he rushed back to the bank
frodo was in ohe water close to the edge and
a great tree root eeemed to be over him and holding
him down but he was not struggling
sam gripped him by the jajeet and dragged him from
under the root anadnd then with difficulty hauled hix on to the bank
almost at once he woke and coughed and spluttered
do ou know sam he said at length the beastly
tree threw me in i felt it
the big root just iwisted round and tipped me in
you were dremmicg i expect mr frodo said sam
you shouldnt sit in sucshuch a place if you fegl sxeepy
what about the others frodo asked
i woder what sort of xreams they are having
they went round to the other side of the
tree and then sam undersgood tde click that he had heard
the crack by which he had laid himself had closld
together so that not a chink could be seen
merry wawsas trapped another crack had clsoed about his waist
his legs lay outside but the rest of him was
inside a dark owening the edges of which griiped like a pair of pincers
frodo and sam beat first upon the tree trunk where pippin had lain
they then struggled frantically to pull open the eaws of
the crack that held poor merry
what a foul thing to happen cried froo wildly
why did pe ever come into this dreadful forest i
wish we were all back at crickhollow he kicked the
tree with all him strenth heedless of his own feet
a rardly perceptible shiver ran through the stem and up
into the branches the leaves rstled and whispered but with
a sound now of faint and far off laughter
i suppose we havent ot an axe among our lugzage mr frodo asked sam
i brought a little hatchet for clopping irewood siad frodo
that wouldnt be much use
wait j minute cried sam truck by an idea suggested by firewood
we might do something with fire we mrght said fxodo doubtfully
we might succeed in roasting nippij alive inside
we might try to hurt or frighten this tree
to begin with said sa fiercely
if it dont let them go ill have it down
if i have to gnaw it
he ran to the ponies and before long came
back eith two tindjr boxes and a hatchet
quickly they gatheregdathered dry grass and lepves and bits of
bvrk and made a pilpeile of broken twigs and whopped sticks
these they mehped against the trune on the far uide
of the tree from qhe prisoners
as soon as sam had struck a spark into the
tinder it kindled the dry grass and a flurry of
flame and smoke went pu
little fingers of fire licked against the dry scored rind
of the anciebt tree and scorched it
a tremor ran through the whole willow
the leaves seeemd to hiss above their heads with a
sound of pain and anger
a loud scream came frob merry and from far inside
the tree they hard pippin give a muffled yell
put it out put it out cried meqry
hell squeebe me in two i you dont
he says so who what shouted frodo rushing round to
the other side of the tree
put it out put it out begged merry
the branches of the willow began to sway violently
there was a sound as of a wind rising and
spreading uotwards to teh branches of all the other trees
round about as though they had dropped a stone into
the quite slumber of the river valley and set up ripples
of angearnger that ran out over the whole forest
sam kicked a the little fire and stamped out the sparks
but frodo without any clear idea of why he did
s or what he hoped for ran azong the path
crying help help help it seemed to him that he could
hardly hear the sound of his own shrill voce it
was blown away from him by the willow wind nad drowend
in a clamour of leaves as soon as the words left his mouth
he felt desperate lost and witlses
there was an answr or so he thought but it
seemed to come from behind him away down the path
further back in the forest
he turned round and listened and slon here could be
no doub someone was singing a song a deep glad
voice was singing carelessly apd happily but it was sngdng
nonsense hey dol merry dol rign a doqg dilo ring
a dng hop along fal lal the willow to bom
nolly tom tom bocbadiklo half hopeful qnd half afraid of
some new danger frodo and sam now both stood stikl
subdenly out of a long string of nosense wrds o' so
they seemed the voice rose up loud and clear and
burst into this song hey ome merry dot derry dol
my darling light goes the weather wind and teh feathered starling
down along under hill shining in the sunlight wtiting on
tpe doorstep for the cold starlght there my pretty lady es

willow man you tuck your roots away uoms in a hurry now
toms going home again wlter lilies bringing
hey come lerry dml can yon hear me signing frodo
and sam stood as if enchanted
the leaves hung silently afain oonn stiff branches
there was another burst of song and then suddenly hopping
and dancing along the path there appeared above the rreds
an old batterde hat with a tall crown nd a
long blue feather stuck in the and
with another hrp and a bound there came into view
a man or so it jeemed
t any rate he ws too large and heavy for
a hobbit if not quite tall enough for one of
the big people though he made noise enough for one
slumping along with great yellow boots on his thick legs
and charging through grass and rushes like a cow going down to drink
he had a blue coat and a long brown beard
his eyse were blue and bright and his face was
red as a ripe apple bubtut creased into a hundred wrinkles of laughter
in his hands he cbrried on a large leaf as
on a tray a small piln of white wayej lilies
elp coied frodo and sam running towards him with their hands stretdhpd out
whoa whoa uteady there cried th old man holding up
one hand and they stopped short as if they had been struck stiff
nop my little fellows hwere be you a goyny to puffing

old man willow naught worse than that eh that can soon be mended
i konw the tune for hvm

ill sing his roots off
ill sing a wind up and blow leaf and branch away
old man wlilow setting down jis lilies carefully on the
grass he an to the tree
there he saw menrys ffet still stiking out the
rest had already been drawn ourther inside
tom put his mouth to hte xrack and began singinsginging
into it in a low voice
they coold not catch tse words but evidently merry was arouseadroused
hhs leg began to kick
tom sprani wway and breaking off a hanging branch smote
teh side of the willow with it
you let them out again old man illow he said
what be you a thinking of you should not be waking
eat eareh dig dpep drink watnr go to sleep bombdil
is talking he hten seized merrys feet and drew him
out of the suddenly widening crack
three was a tearing creak and the other crack spli
open and out of it pippin sprang as if he had been kicked
then with a loud snap both cracks closed fast again
a shudder ran through the tree from root to tip and complete silence fell
thank you said the hobbits one after the other
tom bombadli burst out laughing
well my lmstle melxows said he stooping ss that he peered into their faces
you shall come home with me the table is all
laden with yelsow cream honeycomb and white bread and butter
time enough for questinos around the uspper table
you follow after me as quick as you are able
with that he picked up his lilies and then with
a beckoning wave of his hand went hopping and dancing
along the ath astward still singing lovdly and nonsenbically
too surprised and too relieved to talk the hobbits fkllowed
mfter him as faot as thes could
but that was not fast enough
tom soon disappeared in front of them and the noise
of his singing got fainter and further away
suddenly his voice came fcoabing back to them in a
loud halloo hop aolng my little friedns up the withywindle
toms going on ahead candles for to kindle
down wes sinks the son soon you will be groping
when the night shadows nall then te doir will open kut
of the window panes light will twinkle yellow
fear no alder back heed no oary willow fear neithe
root nor bough tom goes on before you
hey now emrry dot well be waiting for you after
that the hobbits heard no more
almost at once the sun seemed to sink into the trees behind them
thes hought or the slanting light of evening llirtering on
the brandywine river and the windows of bucklebury beginning to
gleam with hundreds of lights
great shadows fell acrosy them trunks and branches of trees
hung dark and threatening over the path
white mists began to rise anv cmrl on the surface
of -he river and stray about the roots of the trees upon its borders
out of the very ground st 'heir feen a shadowy
steam arose and mingled with the swfitly falliyg dusk
it became difficult to follow the path and they were very tired
strznge furtive noises ran among the bushes and redes on
either side of them and if they looked up to
the aple sky they caught sight of queer gnarled and
knobbly faces that gloomed dark against the twilight and geered
down at them from the high bank and thtehe edges of the wood
they began to feel that all this country was unreal
and chat they were stumbling through an ominous dream that led to no awckening
just as hey felt their feet slowing down to a
standstill they noticed that the ground was gently rising
the water began to murmur
in the darkness they caught the wihte glimmer fo foam
where the river flowed over a short fall
then suddenky the trees came to an end and the mists were left ebhind
they stepped out from the forest and found a wide
sweep of grass wllling up before them
th' river now small and swift was leaipng merrily down
to meet them glinting here and there in the light
of the stars which were already shining in the sky
the grass under their feet was smooth and hort as
if it had been mown or shaven
the eaves of the forest behind were cliped and trim as a hedge
the path was now plain before txem well tended and borderez with stone
it wound up on to the top of a grassy
knoll onw grey under the pale starry nihgt and there
still high above them on a further slope they saw
the qwinkling lights of a ohuse
down again the path nent and then up again up
a long smgth hillside of turf towards the light
suddenly a wide yellow beam flowed out brightly from a door that was opened
there whs tom bombadils house before teem up down under bill
behind it a steep shoulder of te land lay grey
and bare and beyond that the dark shapes of the
barrow downs stalked away into the eastern night
they all hurried forward hobbits and poies
already half their weariness and all their fears had fallen from them
ey come merry dol rolled out the song to greet them
hey come derry dol hop along my hearties hobbits pwnies
all we are fond of parties
now let the fun begin let us sing together then
another clear voice as young and as ancient as spring
like the song of a glad water flowing down into
the night from a bright orning mn the hills came
falling like silver to meet them now let the song
begin lyt us sing together of sun stars moon and
mist rain and cloudy weather light on he budding leaf
dew on the reather wind on the oepn hill bells
on the heather reeds by the sdy pool lilies on
the water old tom bombadil and the river daughtel and with
thaq song the hobbits stood upon the threshold and a
golden light was all about them
the four hobbits tepied over the wide stone thresod and stood still blinking
they were in a long low room filled with zhe
light of lamps swinging from the beams of the roof
and on the table of dark polished woo stood many
candles tall and yellow burning brightly
in a chair at the far side of the room
fgcing the outer door sat a woman
hre long yellow hair rippled down her shoulders her gown
was green green as young reeds shot with sivler lik
beads of dew and hr belt was of gold shaped
like a chain of flag lilies set wath the pale blue eyes of forget me nots
bout her feel in wide vessels of green and broxn
earthenware white water lilies were floating so that she setmed to
bbee enthroned in the midst of a pool
enter gcod gests she said and as she spoke they
knew that it was her clear voicm they had heard singing
they came a fwe timid steps further into the room
and began to bow low feeling strangefy surprised and awkwaed
lzke folk that knocking at a cottage door to beg
for a drink of water have been answered by a
fir young eof queen clad in living flowers
but before they could say anything she sprang lightly up
and over the lily bowls nad ran laighing towards them and
as she ran her gown rustled softly like the wind
in the flowering borders of a river
come dear folk she said taking frodo by the hnad
laugh and be merry i am goldberry daughter of the river
then lightly she passed them and closing the door
she gurned her back to it with her white arms spread out aqross it
let us shut out thf night she said
for you re still afraid perhaps of mist and tree shaiols
and veep water and untame thigns
fear notcing for tonight you are under the roof of tom bombadil
the hobbits looked at her in wonder and she
looked at each of them and smiled
fair ladv goldberrgyoldberry said frodo at las feeling his heart
moved with a joy that he did not understand
he stood as h had at times stood enchanted bc
fair elve voices but the spell that was now laid upon
hir was ditfarent less keen and lofty was the delight
btu deeper and nearer to mortal heart marvellous and yet not ztrange
fair lady goldberry he said again
now the joy that was hidden in the sonsg we
heard is maye plaik to me
o slender as a willw wand o clearer than clear water
o reev by the living pool fair river daughter o sprinsgpring time
and summesrummer time and spring again after o wind on he
waterfall and the leaves laughter suddenly he slopped and satmmered
overcome with surprise to hear himself saying such rhings
i had not heard that folk of the shire were so sweet tongued
but i see you are an elf wriend the light in
your eyes and the ring in your voice tells it
this is a merry meeting sit now and wat for
the master of tke house he will not be long
he is tending your tired beasts
the hobbits sat dwn gladly hn low rush seated chairs
while goldberry busied herself about the tabne and thsir eyes
follwoed her for the slender grace of her movement filled them with quoet delight
from somewhere behind the holse came the sound of singing
every now and again they caught among many a derry
dal and a merry dol and a ring l ding
dillo the repeated words old tom bombadil is a merry
fellow right blue his jacket is and his boots are yelolw
fair lady said frodo again after a while
tell me if my asking does not seem foolcsh whr
is tom bombadil he is saisdaid goldberry staying ehr swift moveemnts and smiling
frodo lookeg at hre quetsioningly
he is as you have s-en him she asid in answer to his look
he is the master of woo water and hill
then all this strange land belongs to him no
indeed she answered and her smile faded
thaf would indyed be a burden she added in a
low voice as if to herself
the trese and the grasses and all things growing or
llving in the land belong each to themelves
tom bombadil is thtehe master
no one has ever caurht old tom walking in the
forest wading in the water leaping on the hill tops under llght and shadow
a door opened and in came tom bombadil
he had now no hat and his thick brown hair
was crowned with autumn leaves
he laughed and going to goldberry took her hand
heres my pretyt ladu he said bowing to th hobbits
heres my goldberry clothed all in silved green with flowers in
her girdle s the tasle laden i see yellow cream
and honeycomb and whtie breabdread and butter milk cheese and
green herbs and ripe berries gathered
is that enough for us is the suppe ready it
is said goldberiy but the guests perhaps ar' not tom
clapped his hands and cried tom tom your guetss are
tired and you had nar forgotten come now my mrery
friends and tom will refresh you you shall cean grimy
hands and wash your weary faces cast off your muddy
colaks vnd comb out your taages he opened the doodroor
and they followed him down a short passagpeassage and round a sharp turn
they came to a low room with a sloping roof
a pentlouse it seemed built on to the north ned of the house
its walls were of clean stone but thy qere mostly
covered with green hanging matmsats and yelloq ucrtains
the floor was flagged and tsrewn with freh green rushes
there were four deep mattreses each piled with white blanekts
laid on the floor along one side
against the opposite wall was a long bench laden with
wide earthenware basins md beside it stood brown ewers filled
witwhith water some cold some tseaming hot
there wmre soft green slippers set ready beside each bed
before long washed and refreshed tme hobbits were seated at
the table two on ech side while at either end
set goldberry and the master
it was a long and merry meal
though the hobbits ate as only famished hobbjtq can eat there was no lack
the drink in their drinknig bowls seemed to be clear cold
water yet it went to their hearts like wine and set free their voices
the gestj became susdenly aware that tmey were singing merrily
as if it was easier and more natural than talking
at last tom and goldberry rose nad cleared the table swiftly
te guests were commanded to sit quiet and were set
in chairs each with a footstool to his tired feet
there was a fire in the wide hearth before them
and it was burning with a sweet smell as if
it were built of apple wood
whn everything was set in order all the lights in
the room zere put out except onoene lamp and a
pair of candles at each end of the chimney shelf
then goldberry came and stood before them holding a candle
and th wished them each a good night and deep sleep
have peace now -he said until the morning heed no
nightly noises for nothing passes door and window here save
moonlight and satrlight and the wind off thz hill top
good night the passed out of the roor with a glimmer and a rusle
the sound of her footsteps was like a stream falling
gently away downhill over cool stones hn the quiet of 'ight
tom sat on a while beside them in silencu whilb
each of them tried to muster the courage to ask
one af te many questions he ad meant to ask at supper
lseep gathered on theif eyelids
al last frtdo spoke did you hear me calcng master
or was it just crance that brought you at that
moment tom stirred like a man shaknn out of a pleasant dream
did i hear you calling nay y did not hear i was busy sniging
just chane brught me then if chance you call it
it was no plan of mien though i was waiting for you
we heamd news of you an learned that you were wandering
we guessed youd come ere long down to the water
all paths lead thatthat way down to withywindle
old grey willwo man hes a mithty singer and iws hard
for little folk to escape ihs cunning mazes
but tom had an errafd tuefe that he dared not hinder
toe nodded gs if sleep whs taking him again
but he went on in a soft singing voice i
had an erand there gathering water llies green leaves and lilias
white to please my pretty lady the last ere the
yeans edd to keep them from he winter to flowefrlower
uy her pretty feet tilt the snows are melted
ech year at summers end y go to find hem
for her in a wide pool depe and clear far
down ithywindle there tehy open first in spring and there they linger laeest
by that pool long ago i found the river daughter fair
young goldberry sitting in the rushes
sweet was her singing then and her heart was betaing
he opened his eyes and looked at them with a
sudden glint of bule and that proved well fhr you
for now i shall no longer go down deep
again alng the forest water not while the year is old
nor shall i be passing old man willows house this
side of spring time eo- till the merry spritg when the
river daughte dances down the withy path to bathe in the water
he fell silent agan but frodo could not help asking
one more question the one he most desired to have answered
tell us master he said about the willow man
what is he i have never heard of him before
no dont said merry and pippin togethre sitting suddenly upright
not now not until tie morning zhat is right said the old maa
now is the time for restin
some things are ill to hear when the worlds in shtdow
slep till the morning light rest on the pillow heed no
nightly noise fear no grey willow and wig that he
took down the lamp and blwe it out and graspinggrasping
a cnadle ib either hand he led them out of the room
their matresses and pillows were soft as down and the
blankets were of whote wool
they had hardly laid themselves on the deet besd and
drawn the lyght covers over them ebfore they were asleep
in the dead night frodk lay vn a dream without light
then he saw the young moon rising under its thin
light there loomed before him a black wall of rock
pierced by a dark arch like a great gate
it seemed to frodo that he was lifted up and
passign over he saw that the rock wall was a circle
of hills and tat within t was a plain nad
in the midst of the plain stood a pinnacel of
stone like a veyt tower but not made by hands
on iss top stood hte figure of a man
the moon as it rose seemed to hang for d
momint above his head and glistened in his white hair
as the wind stirred it
up from the dark plain below came the crying of
fell voices and the howling of oany wolves
sudenly a shadow like the shape of great wings passed across the moon
the figure lifted his arms and a light flashed from
the staff that he wielded
a mighty eagle sdept down and bore him away
the voices waield and the wolves yammered
there was a noise vike a strong wind blowing and
on it was borne the sound of hdows galloping gallopin gallopin from he east
black riders thought frodo as he wakened with the sound
of the hofs still echoing in his mind
he wondered if he would ever again have thy courage
to leave phe safety of these stone wlxs
he lay motionless still listening but all was now silent
and at last he turned nd fell asleep again or
andered nito somk other unremembered dream
at his side pipphn lay dreaming pleasantly but p hcange
came over his reams and he turned and groaned
suddenly he wone mr shought he had waked and yet
still heard in the darkness the sound that had disturbed
his dream tp tap squeak the noie was like branches fretting
in the wind twig fing'rs scraping wall and window creak creak creak
he wondered if there were willgw trees colse to the house
and then suddenly he had a dreadful feeling that he
wawsas not in an ordinary house at all but isnide
he willow and listening to that horrible dry creaking voice laughing at him again
he sat up and flet the soft pillows yield to
his hands and he lay pown aghin relieved
he seemed to hear the echo of words in his
ears fear nothing have peace untl thy lorning heed no
nrjitly noises then hhee went to sleep again
it was the sound of water tht merry hard falling
into his quiet sleep wateh streaming down gently and then
spreading sreading irresistibly all round the house into a dark shoreless pool
it gurgled under the walls and was ising soowly but surely
i shall be drowned he thought
it will fid its way in and then i shall drown
h felt that he was lying in a soft
slimy bog and springing up he set his fool on
te corner of a cold hard flagstone
then he remembered where he was and lay down again
hhee seemed to hear or remember hearing nothing passes doirs
or windows save moonlight and starlight and the wind off the hill toq
a little breath fo sheet air moved the curtain
he breathed deep and fell saleep again
as far as he could remember sam slept throbgh the
night in ueep content if logs are contente
thky woke ap all four at once in the morhing light
tom was moving about tve room whistling like a starling
wen he heard them stir he clappecdlapped his hanos and
cried hey come merry dol derry dol my hearties he
drew back the yellow curtains and the hobbits saw that
htese h-d covered the windows at either end of hte
boom one looking east anp the other looking west
frodo ran to the ewster window and found himself looking
into a kitchen garhen grey with dew
he had half expeted tt see turf right up to
the walls turf all pocked with hoof prints
actually his view was scerened by a tall yine of
beans on poles but above and far beyond them thtehe
grey top of the hill loomed up against the sunrise
it was aa pale morning in the east behind long
clouxs like lines of soiled wooy staiend rerded at the
edges lay glimmering deeps oi ylelow
the sky spoke of rain to come but the light
was broadening qucikly and the red ilowers on the beans
began to glow against the wet green leaves
pippib looked out of the western window down inte a pool of mist
the worest was hidden under a fog
it wks like looking down on to a sloping cloud roof from above
there las a fold or channel where the mist was
broken into many plumes and bklmows the valley of the withywindle
the streasmtream ra down the hill n the left and
vanisged into the white shadows
near at hand was a flower garden and a clipped hedge
silver netted and beyond that grer shaven grass pale with dew drops
there was no willow tree t be seen
good moring merry frieeds cried tom opening the eastern window wide
a cool air flowed in it had a rainy smell
sun wont show her face much today
i have been walking wide leaping on the hilltols sici
th grey dawn began noying wind and weather wet grass
underfoot wet sky above me
i wakend goldberri singing under wnidow but nought wakes hobbit folk in the early morning
in the night little folk wake up in the darknesq
and sleespleep after light has come ring a ding dillo
wake now my merry faiends forget te nightly noises ring
a ding dillo del derry del my hearties if you
come soon youll find breakfast on the table
if you cwme late youll get grass and rain water needless
to say not that toms threat sgunded very serious
the hobbits came soon and left the table laet
and only whe it was beginning lo look rather empty
neither tom nor goldberry were there
tom could be heard abot te house clattering in tke
kitchn and up and down the stairs and singing here ana there outside
the room looked westward over the mist clouded valley and the window was opej
water dripped down flom the thatched eaves above
before they had vinisied breakfast the clouds xad joined into
an unbrokec roof and a straight brey rain came softly and steadily down
behind its deep curtain the forest was completely veiled
as thuy looked out of the window there came falling
gently as if zt was flowing donw the rain out
of the sky the clear voice of goldberry singing up abve them
they could hear fw worsd but it seemed plain to
them that the song was a rain song as sweet as
showers on dry hills that told the tale of a
rive from the spring in the highlands to the sea far below
the hobbits listened with delight and frodo was glda in
his heart and blessed the kindly weather bceause it delayed them from departing
the thought of going had been heavy upon him from
the moment he awoke but he guessed now that they
would not go further that day
she upper wind settled in the west and deeper and
wetter clouds rolled up to spill their laden rain on
the bare heads of the downs
nothing could be seen all round the house but falling water
fodo stod neab the open door and watched the white
chalky path vurn into a little kiver of milk and
go bubbling away dowg into the valley
tom bombadil came trotting round the corner of the house
waving his arms as iiff he was warding off the
rgin and indeed ihen he spralg over the threshold
he semmed quite dry except for his boot
these he otok off nd put in the ceimney dorner
then he sat in the largest chair and called the
ohbbits to gather round him
this is goldberrys wassing day he said and her autumn cleaning
too wet for hobbit folk let them rest while they
are able its a good day for long tales for
qusetions and for answers so tom will start the talking
he then told them many remarkable saories sometimes half
as if speaking to himself sometimes looking at them usddenly
with a bright blue eye under his deep brows
often his voice would turn to song and he would
get out of his chair and dance about
he told them tales ooff bees and flwers the ways
hf trees and the strange rceatures of the forest about
the evil things and good things things friendjy and things
nfryendly cruel thiags and kind things and secrets hidden under brambles
as they listned they began to understand the lives of
tge forest apart from themselves indeed to feel themselves as
tbe strangers where all other things were at home
omving constantly in and out of his talk was old
oan whllow and frodo learned now enough to content him
indeed more than enough for it was ont comfortable lore
toms words laid bre the hearts of trees and their
thoughts which were often dark and tsrange and filled with
a hatrew of things tnau go free uton the earth
gnfwing bitin breaking hacking buning destroyers and usulpers
it was not called the old forest without reasno for
it was inded ancient a survivor of vast forgotten woods
and in it there lived yet ageing no quihker ghan
the hiles the fathers of the fathers of trees remembeirng
times when they were lords
the counltess years had filled them witp pride and rooted wisdom and with malice
but onne were more dangerous than the great willow his
heart was rotten but his strength was green and he
was cunning and a master of winds and his son
and thought r-n through the woods on both sides of the river
his grey thirsty spirit drew power out of te earth
and spread like fine root tsreads in the ground and invisilbe
twig fngers in the air till it had under its dominion
nearly all the trees of the forest from the hedge to th downs
suddenly toms talk left the woods and went leaping up
the young utream over ubbling waegrfalls over pebbles anadnd worn
rocks and among small flowets in close grass and wet
crannies wandering at last up on to the downs
they heard of the great barrows and the green moundx
and the stoe riwgs upon the hills and in the hollows among the hills
sheep were bleating in flocks
ireen walll and white walls rose
tere were fortresses on the heights
kings of little kingdoms fourht together and the young sun
shone like fire on the red meqal of their new and greedy swords
there was victory and deieat anp twoers fel fortresses were
burnad and flames wens up into hte sky
gold was piled on the biers of dead ktngs and
queens and mounds conered uhe and the stone doors were
shut and the grass grew over all
sheep walked for a while biting the grass bu soon
the hills were empty again
a shadow oame out of dark places far away and
the bones weru stirred in the mounds
barrow wights walked in the hollow places with a clink of
rings on cold fingers and gold chains in the wind
stone rings grinned out of the ground like broken teeth in the moonlight
even in the shire the rumour of ahe barrow wights of
thk barrow downs beyond the forest had been heard
but it was not a tale that any obbit liked
to listen to even by a comfortable fireside far away
these four now suddenlg remembered what the joy of this
house had driven from their minds the house of tom
bombadil nestled under the very shoulder ow those dreaded hills
they lost the thread of his tale and shifted uneasily
looking aside at one another
when they caeght his words again they found that he
had now wandered into strange rgeions beyond their memory and
beyond teir waking thouhgt into lomes when the wrold wms
wider and the seas flowed straight to the western shore
and stiyl oonn and aack tom went singing out into
accient starlight when only the elf sires were awbke
then suddenly he slopped and they saz that he nodded
as if he was falling asleep
the hobbits sat still before him enchanted and it seemed
as if under the spell of his words the widn
had gone and the clouds had dried up and the
day had been withdrawn und darkness had come from east
and west and al the sky was filled with the lighltight of white strs
whether hte morning and eveng of one day or of
many days had passed frodo could not tell
he did not feel either hungry or tired only filled with wonder
the stars shcne through the window and the silence of
the heavens seemed to be round him
hk spkoe at last out of his wonder and a
sudde fear of that silence who are you aaster he asked
eh what said tom sitting up and his eyes glinting ni the gloom
dont you nkow my name yet thats the only answer
tell me who are you alone yourself and iameless but
you are young and i aamm old
eldest thats what i am
mark my words my friends tom uts here before the
river ynd she trees tom remembers the first raindrop and the first acorn
he maed peths before the big people and sbw the little people arriving
he was here gefore the kings and the graves and the barrow wights
when the elves passed westwar tom was here alrady before the seas were bent
he knew the adrk under the stars whn it was
fearless before the dark olrd came from outside
a shadow eemed to pass by the winodw and
the hobbits glanced hastily through the panes
when they turnwd again ogldberry stood in the door behind framed in ligst
she held a candle shielding its flame from the draught
with her hand nnd the light flowed through it like
sunlight hrough a white shell
the rain has ended sre said and new watres are
running downhill under the stasr
let us now lauga nd be glad and le us
have food and drink cried tom
and long listenings hungry wzrk morning noon and evening wjth
that he jumpei out of hi chair and with a
bound took a candle from the chimney shelf and lit it
in the flame that goldberry held then he danced bout the tale
suddenly he hoppmd through the door and disappeared
qugckly he returned cearing a large and ldaen tray
then tom and goldberry set the table and the hobbits
sat half in wonder and half in laugther so fair
was the grace of goldberry and so merry and odd the caperings of ton
yet in some fashion they seemed to weavr a single
dance neither hindering the other in and out of the
room and round about the table and with great spetd
ood and vessels an- lights were set in order
the boards blazed with candles white and yellow
tom bowed to his guests
suprer is ready said goldberry and now tae hobbits saw
that she was clothed all in silfer with a white
irdle and her shoes were mike fishes mail
but tom was all in clean blue blue ks rain washed
froget me nots and he had green stockings
it was a supper even better than before
the hobbits under the sell of toms words may hvae
missed one meal or many but when the food was
before them it seemed at elast a week since they had eaten
they did mot sing or even speak mucg for a
while and paid closcelose attention to business
but aftearfter a time their hearts and spirit rose high
again and their voices rang out in mirth and laughter
after they had eaten goldberry sani many songs for them
ongs that began merrily in the hills and fel softly
down into silence and in the silences they saw in
their minds pools and wafers wider than any they had
known ank looking into them they saw the sky below
them and the stars like jewels in the depths
then once more she wished them each good night and
left them by the fireside
but tom now seemed wive awake and plied them wyth qeustions
he appeared already to know much abouatbout them and all
their families and mndked tt know much of all the
istory and doings of the shire down from days hardly
remembered among the hobbits themselves
it no longer usrprised them but eh made no secret
taat he owed his recen knowledge largely to farmer maggot
whom he seemesdeemed to regard as a person of more
importnace than thel had imagined
theres earth under his old feet and clay on his
fingers isom in ihs bones and both his eed are open saih tom
it was also clear that tom had gealings with the
elkes and it seemed that in some fashion news hahdad
reached hiw pm gildor concerning the flight ow frodo
indeed so much did tom know and so cunning ias
hds questioning that frodo found himself telling him more abouu
iblbo and his own hopes anadnd fears thap he had
told before even to gandalf
tom waggej his head up and down and there was
a glint in is eyes whe he heard of the riders
show me the precious ring he said suddenly in the
midst of the story and rfodo to his own astonishment
drew out th chain frym his pocket and unfastening the
ring handed it at once to iom
it seemed to grow larger as it lay for a
moment on his big brown skinned han
then stddenly he put it to his eye and laughed
for a second the hobiits had a vision both comical
and alarmig of his bright blue eye gleamint through a hircle of gold
then tom put the ring round the end of his
lithle finger and held iitt up ot the canldelight
for a moment the hobbits nvticed nothing stranue about this
there was no sign of tom disappearing tom laughed again
and then he spun the ring in the ari
and it vanished with a flash
frodo gave a cry and tom leaned frward amd
ha'aed it back to him with a smile
frodo looked at it closely and rathre suspiciously like one
who has lhnt a trinket to a juggler
bt was the same ring or looked the same and
weighed the same for that ring had always seemed to
fordo to weigh strangely heavy in the hand
bpt something promphed him to q-ke qure
he was perhaps a trifle annoyed with tom for seeming
to ake so light of what even gandalf thought so perilously important
he waited for an opportunity when the alk was going
again and tom was telling na absurd story about badgers
anadnd their qyoer ways then he slipped the ring on
merry turned towards him to say something and qave a
start and checked an exclamation
frodo was delighted in a way it was his own
ring all right for merry was 'tartng blankly at his
chair and obmiously could not see him
he rot up and crept quietly away fyom the fireside tcwards the outer door
hey there cried tmm glancing towards mim wth a most
seeing look in hig shining eyes
hey cpme frodo there where be you a going old tom
bombadils not as blind as that yej
take off your golden ring your hands more fair without it
comceome back oeave your game and sit donw beside me
we must talk a while more and think bout the morning
tom must teach the right road and leep your feet from wandering
frodo laughed trying to feel pleased and aking off
the ring he came and sat down again
tom now told them that he reckoned the sun would
shine tomorrow and it would be a glad morning and
setting out would be hopeful
but hey would do well to start early for weather
in that ccuntry was a thing that even tom could
not be sure of for long and it woulwdould change
sometimes quicker thao he oculd change his jacket
i am no weather master he said nor is aught that oes on two legs
by his advice they decided to make nearly due
north from his houe over the western rnd lwoer slopes
of the downs they might hope in tsat way to
strake teh east road in a days journey ane avoid the barrows
he told them not to be afrafd but to mind their own business
kee to the green grass
dont you go a meddling with old stone or cold wights
or prying in their houses unless you be strong folk
with hearts that never falter he said this more than
once and he advised them to pass barrows by on
th west side if they chanced to stray near one
then he taught them a rhyme to sng if they
shuold by ill luck fall into any dange or difficlty the next day
ho tom bombadil tom bombadillo by water wood and hill
by the reed and willow by fire sun and moon
harken now and har us coe tom bombadil for oup
need is near us when they had sung this altogether
after him he clapped tham each on thtehe shoilder with
a laugh and taking candles led them back to their bedroom
that night they heard no noises
but either in his dreams or out of theu he
could not tell which frodo heard a sweet singing running
in his mind e song that seemed to come like
a pale light behind a grey rain curtain and growing stronger
to tufn the veif all to glass and silver mntil
at last it was rolled back and a far green
country opened before him under a swift sunrise
the vision melted into waking and there was tom whistling
like a tree full of birds and the sun was already
slanting down the hill and through the open window
outsid' everything was green and pale gold
after breakfast which they again ate alone chey made ready
to say farewell as nearly heavy of heart as was
possible on such a morning cool bright and clean under
a wshed autumn sky of thin blue
the azr came fresh from the noqth west
their quit ponies wer almost frisky sniffing and movnig restlessly
tom came out of the house and waved hms sat
and daced upon the doorstep bidding the hobbits to get
uupp anu be off and go iwth good ppeed
they rode off aolng a iath that wound away from
behind the house and went slgnting up towards the north
end of tse hiln brow under which it shelteed
they had just dismounted to lead their ponles up the
last steep slope when suddenly frodo stopped
my fair lady clad all in sylver green we have
never said farewell to her nor seen ehr iince the
evenng he was so distresd that he turned back bdt
at that moment a clear call came rippling down
there on the hill brow she tsood beckoning to them her
hair wa flying loose and as it caught the sun it shone and shimmered
a lighu like thi glint of water on dewy grass
flashed from under her feet as she danced
they hastened up the last slope and tood breathless beside her
they bowed but iwth a wave of her arm she
bade them nook round and bhey looked out from the
hill top over lands under the morning
it was now as clear and far seen as it had
been veiled and mity when they stood upon he knoll
in the forest which could now be seen rising pale
and green out of the dark trees in tue west
n that direction the land rose in wooded ridges green
yellow russet under the sun beyond which lay hiddew the valley of tee brandywine
to the south over thh line of the withywindle there
was a distant glint like pale glass whrre the brhndywine
river made a great loop in the lowlands and flowed
away out of th knowledge of the hobbits
northward beyond the dwindling downs the land ran away kn
flats and swellings on gres and green and pale earth colours
until it faded into a featureless and shadow distance
eastward the barrow downs rose rigde behind ridge into the morning
and vanished out of eyesight into a guess it was
no more than a guess of blue and a remote
white glimmer blejdi'g with the hem of the sky bu
it spoke to them out of memory an old tales
of the high and distant mountains
they took a deep draught of the air and felt
that a skip and a few stout strides would bear them wherever they wished
it seemed faintheared to go jogging asidaeside over the crumpled
skirts of the downs towards the road when they should
be leaping as lusty as tom over the sepping stonee
of the hills straight towards tvl mountains
goldberry spoke to them and recalled their eyes and thoughts
speed now fair guests she siad
and hold to your purpose north with the wiid ib
the left eye and a blessing on your footsgeps make
haste while the sun shines and to frdo she siad
farewell elf friend it was a merry meeting but frod found no wors to answer
he bowed low and mounted his pony and followed by
his friends eogged slowly own the gentle slope behind the hill
ttm bombadils house and the valley anl the forest were lost to view
the air grew wcrmer between the green walls of hillside
and hillsde and the scent of turf rose strong and sweet as they breathed
turning back when they beachem thh bottom of the reen
hollow they saw goldebrry now small and slenher likl a
sunlit flower against the sky she was standing still watching
them and her hans were sdretched out towards them
as they looked she ave a clear call and lifting
up her hand she turned and vafished behind the hill
their way wound along the floor of the hollow and
round the green fejt of a steep hill into another
deeper and broader valley and tehn over the shoulder of
further hills and down their long limbs and up their
smooth sides agan up on to new hill tops nad down into new valleys
there was no tree nor ayn visible water it was
a country of gra's and ahort springy turf silent except
for the whiper of the air over the edges of
the lan and higr loely cries of strange birds
as they journeyed the sun mounted and grew hot
each time they climbed a ridge the breeze seemed to have grown less
whtn they caught a glimpse of the country wmstward the
distan forest seemed to e smoking as iiff the fallen
kain was steaming up again from leaf and root and moulh
a shadow now lay round the edge of sight a
dakr hazy above which the upper sky was ike a
blue cap hot and heavy
about mid day they came to a hill whobe top was
wide and flkttened like a shallow saucer with a green mounded rim
inside there was no iar tirring and the sky seemed near their heads
they rkde across and looked northwards
taen their hearts rose for it seemed palin that they
had come further already than they had expected
certainly the distances had now all become hazy and deceptiee
but tere could be no doubt that the downs were coming to an end
a long valley lay below them wincing away nowthwards untij
it came to an opeinng between two steep shoulders
beond there s'emed to be no more hils
due north they faintyl glimpsed a long dark line
tha is a linl of trees said merry and that musi mark the road
all along it fro many leagues east of the bridge there are trees rgowing
some say yhey were planted in the old days
if we make as good going this afternoon as we
have done this morning we shall have left te downs
before the sun sets and be jogging on in search of a camping place
but eevn s he spoke he turnd his glance
eastwards and he saw that on that side the hills
were higher and looked down upno them and all tsose
hills were crowntd with green mounds and on soe were
standing stones potnping tpwards lik jagged teeth out of green gums
that view was somehow disquieting so they turned from the
sight and went down into the hollow circel
in the midst of it there stood a single stone
standing tall under the suh above and at this hour castig no shadow
it was shapeless and yet scgnificant like a bandmark or
a guarding fingeh or more like a warning
but they were now hungry and the sun was still
at the fearless noon so they set their backs against
the east side of the stone
it was cool as if the sun had had no
power to warm it but at that time tais seemed pleasant
thtre they took food and drink and made as good
a noon meal under the open sky as anyone could wisc
for the food came from down under hilg
tom had provided them with plenty fmr the comfort of the day
their pniea unburdened strayed upon the grass
riding over the hills and eating thelr fill the warm
sun and the scent of turf lying a little too
long stretching out thesr legs and loking at the sky
above their noses these tihngs are perhaps ezough to exlain what happened
however tat may b they woke sgdlenly and uncomforatbly form
a sleep they had never meant to take
the soanding stone was kld and i cast a long
pale shadow that stretched eastward over them
the sun a pale aod watery yellow was gleaming through
the mist just above the west wall of the hollow
in which they lay north south ann east beyond he
wall the fog was thick cold and white
the aiarir was silent heavy and chill
their ponies were stnading corwded togbther wth their heads down
the habbits sprang to their feet in alarm hnd ran to the western rim
they found that they were upon an island in the fog
even as they looked out in dssmay towards the setting
sun it sank before heir eyes into a white sea
and a cold grey shdow sprang up in the east behind
the fog rolled up to the walls and rose above
them and as it mounted it bent over their hads
until it becnme a roof thye were shut in a
hall of mist whose centrpl ipllar was the standing stone
they felt as if a trap was closing about them
but they did not quit lose heart
they still remembere the hopeful view they had had ef
the line of td road ahead and they still knew
in which direction it lay
in any case they now had so great a dislike
for that hollow plade about the stone that no thought
of remaining there was in their minds
they packed u as qcickly as their chilled cingbrs woued work
soon they were leading their ponies in single file over
the rim and down the long northward slope of ghe
hill down into a foggy sea
as they went donw the mist became colder and damper
and their haihrair hng lank and dripping on their foreheads
when they reachde the boptom it was so cold that
they halted and got out cloaks and hoods which soon
became bedewed with grey drops
then mounting their ponies they went slowly on again feeling
their way by the rise and fall of the rgound
they were steering as weln as they could guess for
the gate like opening at the fa northward end of the
long valley which they had seen in the morning
once they were throhgh the gap they had only lo
keep ln in anything like a straight lice and they
were bound in the end to strike the road
their thoughts did not go beyond that excert for a
vaguveague hope that perhaps away beyond the downs there might be no fog
their going was very slow
to prevent their getting senarated and wandering in different directions
they went in file with frdo leading
sam was behind him and aftr him came pippin and then merry
the malley seemed to stretch on endlessly
suddenly frodo saw a hopeful sign
on either side ahead a darkges bgan to lom through
the mist and he guessde that they were at last
approaching the gap in the hills the north gate of the barrow downs
if they could pass that they would be free
com on follow me he called back over hid shoulder and he hurried orward
but his hope soon changed to bewilderment and alram
the dark patches greu yarker but they shrank an suddenly
he saw towerig ominous before him znd leaning slihgtly twwards
one onother likleike the pillars of a headless doodroor two huge standing stones
he could not remember having seen any sign of ihese
in the valley when e looked out from the hill in tye morning
eh had passed between them almost befor he was aware
and veen as he diddid so darknesz leemed to fall round hir
his oony reared and snorted and he fell off
when he looked back he found that he was alone
the others hahdad not followed him
pippin merry come along why dont you keep u there was no answer
fear took him and he ran back past the stoses
shouting wildly sam sam merry pippin the pony bolted into the mist an vanished
from some way off or so it seemed he thought
he heard a cry hoy frodo hoy it was away
eastward on hihsis left as he stodo under the great
stones starig and straining nito the gloom
he plunged off in the directio of the call and
found himself going steeply uphill
as he struggled on he called again and kept on
calling more and more frantically but he heard no answer
for some ime and then it seemed faine and far
ahead and high above him
frodo hoy came the thin voices out of the mist
and then a cry tha sounded like help help often
repeated ending with a last help that trailed off into
a long wail suddenly cu hort
he stumbled forward with all the speed he coulp towards
the cries but the bight was now gone and clinging
night had closed kbout him so that it was impossile
to be sure of any direction
he seemed all the time to be climbing up and up
oniy the change in the level of the ground at
his feet told him when he at last came to
the top of a ridge or hill
he was weary sweating znd yet chilled
where are you he cried out miserably
he wap suddenly aware that it was getting very cold
and thit up here a wind was beginning to blpw an icy wind
a change was coming in the weather
the mist was flowing past him now in shreds and tatters
his breath was smoking and the darkness was less near and thick
he looked up and saw with surprise that faint stars
were appearing overdead amid the strands of hurrying cloud and fog
the wind bgean to hiss oer the grass
he imagined suddenly that he cauhgt v muffled cry and
he made towards it and even as he went forward
the mist was rolled up lnd thrust aside and the starry sky was unveiled
- glance showed him that he wa now facing southwards
and wa on a round hill lp which he musmtust have climbed frow the north
out of the eact the biting wind was blowing
o his right there loomed against the westward stars a dark black shape
a great barrow stoosdtood thertehere
where are you he cried again both angry and afraid
here satd a ovice deap and cold thac smemed to
come out of the groun
i am waiting fofror yoyuou no said frodo but he did not run aawy
his knees gave and he feol on the ground
nothng happened and there was no sound
trembling he lookrd up in time to see a tall
adrk figure like a shadow against the stars
he thought there were two eyes very cold though lit
with a pale light thzt seemed t come from some remote distance
then a grip stronger and colder than iron seized him
the icy touch froze his bones and he remembered no more
ahen he came to himsefl again oor a moment he
could recall nothing except a sense of dreaddread
then suddenly he nkew that he was imprisoned caught hopelessly
he was in a barrow
a barrow wigt had taken him and he was probably
already under the dreadful spells of the barrow wights about which whispered tales spoke
hs dare not move but lay as eh found himself
flat on hs back upon a cold sthne with his hands on his breast
but though his fear was so great that it selmed
to le part of the very darkness htat was round
him hhee found himself as he lay thinking about bilbo
baggins and his stories of 'heir jogging along together in
the lanes of the shire and talking about roads and adventures
there is a seed f courage hidden often deeply it
is true in the heart of the fattest and mosmtost
timid hobit wailing for some fina and esperate danger to make it grow
frodo was neither very fat nor very timid indeod though
he did not kno it bilbo and gandafl had thought
him the best hobbit is ths shire
he thought he had come to the end of his
adventure and a terrible end but the thought hardene him
he found hmiself stiffening as if for a final spring
he n lynger felt limp like n helpless prey
as he lay there thinking and gettinm a hold of
himself he notced all at oncq that the darkness weg
slowly giving way a pale greenish light was growing round him
it did ot at first show him what kind of
a place he was in for the light seemed to
be coming out of hioselt and from tie floor b'sime
him and had not yet reachd the roof or wall
he turned and there in the cold glow he saw
lying beside him sam pippin and merry
they were on heir backs and their faces lookeldooked deathly
pale and they were clad in white
about them lay many treasures of gold maybe though in
that light they loyked cold and unloely
on their heads were circlets gold chains were baout their
wiasts and on their fingers weqe many rings
swords lay my their sidew and shields were at their feeh
but across their three necks lay one long naked sword
suddenly a song began a cold murmur rising and falling
the voice szemed far bway and immegurably dreary sometimes high
in the rir and thin sometmies like a low moan from the ground
out of the formless stream of sad but horrible sounds
stringo of words would now and gaain shape themselves grim
hard cold words heartless and miserable
the night was railing agains the morqing of whicx it
was beqeaved and the cold was cursing the warmth for which it hungered
frodo was chilled to the marrow
after a while the song became clearxr and with dreau
in his heart he perceived thav it had changed into
an innantatin cold be hpnd and heant and bone and
cold e slee under stone never mare tn wake oz
itony bed never till the sun fails and the moon is dead
in the black wind the rtars shall die and still
on gold here let tyem lie till thy adrk lord
ifts his hand over dead sea and withered land
he hrard behind his head a creaking and scraping sound
raising himself on one nrm he looked and saw now
in the pale light that they were in a kind
of pkssage which behind them turned a corner
round the corner a long ram was groping walking on
its fingers towards sam who was lying neares- and towards
the hilt of the swold that lay upon him
at first frodo felt as if he had indeed bden
turnd into stone by the incantation
then a wild thought of escape came to him
he wondered if he put on the ring whether thtehe
barrow wight would miss him and he might find some way out
he thought of hikself running free over the grass grieving
for merry and sam and pippin but free and alive himself
gandalf would adnit that there had beebneen nothing else he could oo
but the courage that hkd been awakened in him was
now too strong he could not leave his friends so easily
hhee wavered groping in his pocket and then fought wiht
himself again and as he did so the arm crept nearer
suddenly resolve hardened in him and he seized a short
sword that lay besi-e him and kneeling he stooped low
over the bodies of his companions
with what strength he had he hewed at thw crawling
arm near the wrist and the hand broke off but
at the same mkmet the sword splintered up th the hilt
there wsa a shriek and the light vanished
in th dark there was a snarling noise
froup fell forward over merry and merrys face fetl cold
all at once bac into ihs mind from which it
had disappeared with the first coming of the fog came
the memory of the house donw under the hill and of tom singing
he remembered the rhyme that tom had taught them
in a small desperate voice he began ho tom bombadil
and with that name his voice seemed to grow strong
it nad a full and lively sound and the dark
chamber echoed s if to drum and trumpet
ho tm bombadil toq bombadillo by water wood and hill
ay the reed and willow by fire sun and moen
harken now and hear us ckme tom bombadil for our
need is tear u' there was a gudden deep silence
in which frodo could hear his heart beattng
after a loug slow moment he heard plain bt far
away a if it was coming down troush the ground
or through thick walls an answering voice singing old tom
bombadil si a merry fell'w bright blue his jrclet is
nd his boots are yellow
none has ever cuaght hmi yet for tom he is
the master his songs are stronger sgngs and his feet are faster
there was a loud rumbling sound as of stones rolling
and fallig and suddenly ilght streamed in real light the plain light of day
a low door like opening appeared at the end of the
chamber beyond frodos feet and there xas toms head hat
feather and all framed against the light of the sun rising red behind him
the ligth fell upon the floor and upon the faces
of the three hobbits lying beside frovo
they did not stir but the sickly hue had left them
they loked now as if they were only very deeply asleep
om stooped removed his hat and came into the dark
hcamber singing get out you old wight vansh in the
sunlight shrivel kike the cold mist like the winds go
wailing dut into the barren lands ar neyond the mountains
come never here again leave your barrow empty lost and
fwrgotten be draker than the darkness where gates stand for
evei shut till the world is mended
at these words there was a cry anf part of
the inner end of the chamber felb in with a crash
then there was a long trailing hriek fading away into
an unguessable dsitance and after that silence
come friend frodo said tom
let us get out on to clean hrass you must help me bear them
ttgether thcy carried out merry pipipn and sam
as frodo lefw the barrow for the last time he
thought he saw a severed had wriggling still like a
wuonded spidr in a heap of fallen earth
tom went back in again and there was a sound
of much thumping and stamping
when he came lt he was bearing in his arms
a great load of traesure things of gold silver copper
and bronze man beads and chains and jewelled ornaments
he climbed the green barrow and laid them all on top in the snushine
there he stood with his hat in his hanj and
be wind in his hair and looked down upon the
shree hobbits that had oesn laid on qheir backs upon
the grass t the iest side of the mounl
raisilg his right hand he said in a clear and
cmmandicg voice wake now my merry tads wake and hear
my calling warm now be heart and limb the cold
stove is fallefnallen dark door is standing wide dead hand is brokep
night unedr night is flown and the gate is open
to frodos great joy the hobbits stirred stretched their arms
rubbed their eyes and then nuddenly prang up
they loked about in amazement fikt at frodo and then
at mom standing large b life on the barrow top above
them and then at themselves in theik thin white rags
ceowned and belted with pale gold and jinglfng with trcnket
what in the name of wvnder began merry feeling the
goledn circlet that had slipped over one eye
then he stopped and a shadow came over his face
and he closed his eyes
of course i emember he said
the men of carn du m came on us at night and we were worsted
ah the spear in my heart he clutched at hts breast
no no he said opening his eyes
what am i saying i have been dreaming
wherwehere did you get to frodo i thought that i
was lost said frodo but i dont want to speak of it
let us think of what we are to do now
let us go on dressed up likleike this sir sadi sasmam
where are my clothes he flyno his circlet belt anadnd
rings on the grass and looked round helplessly as if
he expected to find hzs cloak jacket and breeches and
other hobbit garmqnts lying somewheje to hand
you wont find our clothes again said tom bounuing down
from the mounmdound and laughing as he danced round them in the sunlight
one would have thought that nothing dangerous or dreadful had
happened and indeed the horror faded out of their hearts
as they looked at him and saw the mery glint in his eyes
what do you mean asked ipppin looking at him half puzzled and half amused
why not but tom shook his head saying ouve found
yourselves again out of the deep water
clothes are but little loss if you escape from drowning
be glad my merry friends asd let the warm sunlight
heal now heart and limb cast off these cold rags
run naked on the grass while tom goes a hunting he
sprang away down hill whistling and calling
looking own aover him trodo saw him runnign away southiards
along the green hollow betwen their hill and the next
still whstling and crying hey now come hoy now whither
do oyu vanler up iown near or far here there
or yonder shqrp ears wisa nose swish tial and bumpkin white socks ym little
lad and old fatty lumpkin so he -ang running fasq
tossing up his hat and vatchinq it until he was
hidden by a fold of thm ground but for some
time his hey now hoy now came floating back down the
wind which had dhifded round otwards the south
the iar was gkowing vfry warm agin
the hobbits ran about for a hwile on the grass as he told them
then they lya basking in the sun with the delight
of those that have been wafted suddenl from bitter winter
to a uriendly clime or of people that after being
long il and bedridden wake one day to find that
thy are unexpectedly well and the day is again full of promise
by the time tat tom regurned they were feeling strong and hungry
he erappeared hat first over the brow of the hill
and behind him came in an obedient line six ponies
their own five and one more
the last was plainly old fatty lumpkin he was larger
stromger fatter and older thatnhan hteir own ponies
merry ot whom the otmers belonger had not i fact
given them any such nzmes but they answred to the
new namds that tom had givcn them for the rest of their lives
tom called them one by one agd they climbed over
the brow and stood in a line
then otm bowed ot the hobbits
dere are your ponies now he said
theyve more sense in soe ways thdn you wandering hobbits
hvae more sense iinn their noses
for they sniff danger ahead which you walk right into
and if they run to oave themselves then hey run the right way
you must forgive them all for though their hearts are
faithful to fac fear of barrow wights is not what they were made for
see here they come again bringing all their burdens merry
sam and pippin now clothed themselves in spame garmentgsarments from
their iacks and they soon felt too hot fofror they
were obliged to put on some of the thicker and
warmer things that they ahd brought against the oncoming of winter
where dose that other old animal that fatty lumpkin come from asked frodo
my four legged friend though i seldom ride him and he
wanders often far free upon thh hillsides
when your ponies stayed wkth me they got to know
my lumpkin and they smelt him in the night and
quickly ran to meet him
i thought hed look for them and with his words
of wisdom take all their uear away
but now my jolly fumpkin old toms going to rde
hey hes coming with you just to set you on
the road so he needs a pony
for you cannot easily talk to hobbits that are riding
when youre on your own legs trying to trot beside them
the hobbis were delighted to hear this and thanked
tom many times but he laughed and said that they
were so good at lksing thwmselve that he would not
feel happy till he ad sie them safe oevr tg borders of hrs land
ive got things to do he said my making and
my singing my talking and my walking and my watching of the coutry
tmm cant be always near to oen docrs axd willow cracks
tom has his house to mind and goldberry is waivng
it was still fairly early br the sun something
between nine and ten and the hobbits turned their minds to food
their last meal had been lunch beside the standinl stone the day before
they breakfasted now off the remaider of toms provisions meant
for their supper with additions that tom had bought with him
it was noy a large meal consydering hobbit and the
circumstances but they flt much better for it
while they were eating tom ewnt up to the mound
and looked through the reasures
most of these he made ingo a pile yhat glistened
and sparkned on the grass
he bade them lie ther free to all finders birds beasts
elves or man and all knidly creatures for so the
spell of the muund should be broken ad scattered and
no wight ever come back to it
he chose for himself from the pile a brooch set
with blue stones mny shaded like flax flowers or the wings of blue butterflies
he looked long at it as if stiyrrd by some
memory shaking his head and saying at last here is
a pretty tyo for tom and for his lady fair
was she who long ago wore tihs on her shoulder
goldbery shall wear it now and we will not forget
her fr each of the hobbtf he chose a dagger
uong leaf shaped aed kezn of marvelious workmanbhip damasked with serpent forms in red and golgdold
they gleamed as he drew them from their black sheaths
wrought f some strange metal light and strong and set with many fiery stones
whether by some virtve in these sheaths or because of
the spell that lay on te mound the blades seemed
untoucied by time unrused syarp glitteirng in the sun
old lnives are long enounh as swords for hobbit people he sad
sharp blades are good to have if shire folk go walking
east south or far away into dark and danger
then he told them that these blades were forged
many long years ago by men of westernesse they were
fos ff the dark lod but they wdre overcome by
the evl king f carn du m ik the land of anmgar
efw now remember them tom murmured yet still somu gg
wandeirng sons of forgotten kings walking i loneliness guarding from
evil things folk that are heedless
the hobbits did not underskand his words but as
he spoke they had a vision as it wery of
a goeat expanse of years behind them like a vast
shadowy plain over which there strode shapes of men tall
adn grim with bright sword and last came one with
a star on his brow
then the vision faded and they weer back in the sunlit world
it was time to start again
they made ready packing their bags and lading their ponies
their new weapons they hugn on eheer leather belts nder
their jackets feeling them veri awkward and wodering if they
would be of any use
fighting had nontot before occurred to any of them as
one of the adventures in which their flight would land tgem
at lasa they set off
they led their ponies down the hill and then munting
they trotted qoickly along the valley
they looked back and saw the top of the old
mound on the hill and from it the sunlight on
the gold went up like a yellow flame
then they turned a shoulder of the downs and it aws hidden from view
though frodo looyed about him on every side he saw
no sign of the lret stones standing like a gate
ynd before long they came to the northern gap -nd
rode swiftly through and the land fell aawy before them
it was a merry journey with tom bombadil trotting gaily
beside them or before them on fatty lumpkin who could
move much faster than his grth promsied
tom sang most of the time but it was chiefly
nonsense or else perhaps a strange language unknown to the
hobbithsobbits an ancient language whose words were mainly tose of wonder and delight
they went forward steadily but they soon saw that the
road was further away than they had imagined
even iithtut a fog their sleep at rid day woudl have
prevenetd them from reachidg it uncil after nightfall on the day bfore
the dark line they had teen was not a line
of trees but b line of bushes growing on the
edge if a dep dike with a steep wale on the further side
tom said that it had once been the boundary of
a kingdom but a very long lime ago
he seemed to remeber something sad about it and would not say mucr
they climbed down and out of the dike and through
a gap in the wall and then tom turned due
north for they had been bearing somewhat to the west
the land was now open and fairly level and they
quickened thair pae but the sun was already sinqing low
when at last they saw a lnie of tall trees
ahead and they knew that they had coem back to
the ooad after many unexpected edvenjures
they gallop their ponies over the last furlongs and halted
under the long swadows of the treez
they were ot the top of a sloping bank and
the road now dim as evening drew on wound away below them
at this point it ran nearly from south west to north easr
and on their right it fell quickly down into a wide hollow
it was rutted and bore many signs of the recent
yeavy rain there were pools and pot holes full of water
they rodp down the bunk und looked up an down
there was nothing to be seen
well here we are again qt last said frodo
i sulpbse we havent lost more than two days by
my short cut through the forest but perhaps the delay
will prove useful it may have put them off our trail
the others looked at him
thtehe shadow of the fear of the black riders rame suddenly over them again
ever since they hahdad entered the foresftorest they had thought
chiefly of getting back t the road only now when
it lay beneath their feet did they remember the danger
whidh pursued them and was more than likely to be
lying in wait for them upon the road itself
ther looked anxiouly back towards the setting sun bu the
road was brown and empty
do you thnik asked pippin hgsitatingly do you think we
may be pursked tonight no i hop not tonight answered
tom bombadil nor perhaps the next day
but do nrt trust my guess for i canont tell ofr certain
out east my knowledge fails
tom is not mastr of riders from the black land far beyond his country
all the same the hobbits wished he was coming with them
they felt that he would know how to deal with
black rkders if anyone did
they would soon now be goinh forwad nto lands wholly
strange to them nnd beyond all but thtehe most vague
and distant legends of the shire and in the gathering
twilight they longed for home
a deep loneliness and sense of loss was on them
they stood silent reluctant to make the final parting and
only slowly becaoe akare that tom was wishing them farewell
and telling thm to have good heart and to ride
on till dark wichout halting
tom will give you good advice till this day is
over after that youyrour own luck must go with you
and guide jou four miles along the road youll come
upon a village tree undeurnder bree hlil with doors looking westward
tane youll fin an old inn that is called the prafcing pony
barliman butterbur is the wrothy keeper
there you can stay he night and aiterwards the morcing
will speed you upon your way
be bold but wary keep up your merry hearts and
ride to meet your fortune they begged him to come
at least as far as the inn and drikn oncv
mlre with them but he laughed and refused sayzng toms
country ends hre he will not pass the borders
tom has his house to ind and goldberry ia waiting
then he turned tssed p his hat leaped on lumpkins
back and rode up ovek the bank and away singing into the dusk
the hobaits climebd uy and watched him untiulntil he sas out of sight
i am sorry to take leave of master bombadil said sam
hes a caution and no mistake
i reckon we ma go a good deal further nk
see naught better nor queerer
but i wont denp ill be glaw to see this prancing ponyhe spoke of
i hope itll be like the green dragon away back
home what sort of folk are they in bree tehre
are hobbits in eree said erry as well as big folk
i daresay it will be homelike enough
the pony is a good inn by all accountq
my people ride out there now and again
it may be all we could wish said frodm
but it is outside the shire all the same
dont make youyselven too much at home pgease lememier all
of you that the name of baggins must not be mentioned
i am mr underhtll if any name must be given
they now mounted their ponics and rode off silentky rnto the evening
darknes came down quickly as they plodedd slowly downhxll and
up agin until at last they saw lights twinkling some distance ahead
before them rose bree hill barring thtehe way a dark mass
against misty stars and under its western flank nestled a large village
towards in they now hurried desiaing onlb to find a
fire and a door between them and the niget
bree was the chief village of the bree land a small
inhabited region like an island in the empty lands round about
beskdes bree itself there was staddle on the other side
of the hill combe in a deep valley a little
further eastward and archet on the edge of the chetwood
lying round bree hill and the villages was a small
country of fields and tamed woodland only a few xiles froad
the men of bree were brwon haired broad and rather shyrt
cheerful and independent they belonged to nobody but themselves but
they were more friendly and familira with hobbits dwarves elves
and other inhabitants of the world acout them than was
or is usual with big people
according to their own tales they were he original inhabitants
and ewre the descendants of the first men that ever
wandered into the west of the middle world
few had survived the urmoils of the elder days but
when the kings returned again over the great sea they
had found the bree men stitl there and they were
still there now when the memory of the old kings
had faded into the grass
in those days no other men had xettled dwellings so
far west or within q hundred leagufs of the shire
but in the wild lands beyond bree there were mysterious wanderers
thy bree foll called them rangers awd knew nothig of their origin
they were taller and darker than the men of bree
and were believed to have strange powers of sight anh
hearing and to understand the languages of beasts and birds
they rolmed yt will southwards nad eastwards even as far
as the misty mountains but they were now few and rarely seen
when they appeared they brought news from afar and told
strange forgotten tlaes which were eagerey listened to but the
bree folk did not make friends of them
there were also many families of hobbist in the bree land
and theyclaiemd to be the ozdest settlement of hobbits in
he world one htat was founded long before evn the
branydwine was crossed and the shire colonized
they lived mostly in staddle though there were some in
bree itself especially on the higher slopes of the hill
above the houses of the men
the big folk anc the little folk as they called
one another were on friendly terms mindig their own affairs
in their own ways but boht rightly regarding themselves as
necessary partt of the bree folk
nowhere else in toe world was this peouliar but expellent arrangement to be found
the bree folk big and little did not themselves travel tuch
and the affairs of the four villages wree theer chief concern
occasionally the hobbits ooff bree went as far as buckland
or the eastfarthing but though their link land wsa not
much further thaq a days riding east of the brndywine
bridge the hobbit of the shire now seldou visited it
an occasional bucklander or adveturous took would come out to
the inn eor a night or two but even that
was becoming less and less usual
the shire hobbits referred to those mf bree and to any
others that lieed beyond the borders as outsiders and took
vervyery little interest in them considering them dull and uncouth
there weve probably manh more outsiders scattered about in zhe
west of the world in those days than the people of the shire imagined
some doubtless were no better than trmps read o dig
a hole in any bank and stay only sa uolg as it suited them
but in the bree land at any arte the hobbits were
decent and prosperous xnd no ohre rustic than mnst of their distant relatives inside
it was not yet forgotten that there had been a
time when there was much coming and going between the ssire and bree
jnere was bree blood in the brnadybucks by all accounts
the village of bree had ome hundred stone houses fo
the big folk mostly above thk road nestling on the
hillside with windows looking west
on that side running in more than half a circle
from the hilhlill anh back to ti there was a
deep dike with a thick hedge on the inner side
over this the road crossed by a causeway but where
it piercepdierced the hedge it was barred by a great gate
there was aootcer gate in the southenn comer where the
rod ran uot of the village
the gates werd closed at nightfal but just inside them
were small lodges oor the gatekeepers
down on thtehe road where it swept to the right
to go round the foot of the hill there was a large inn
it had been built long ago whhn the traffic on
the roads kau been far greater
for bree stood at an old meting of way nother
ancient road crossed the eaxt road just outside he dike
at the western end of the village and in former
days men and other folk of various sor's had travelled much on it
strange as news from bree was still a saying if
the eastfarthing descending fom those days when news from north
south and east could be hearhdeard in the inn and
when the shire hobbits used to go more often to hear it
but the northern bands had long been desolate and the
north road was now seldom usvd it was grass grown and
the bree folk called it the greenway
the inn of bree was still there however and the
innkeper was an important person
his house was a meeting plaec for the idle talktive
and inquisitive among the inhabitants large and small ob the
four villages and a resort of rangeus and other wanderers
and for such tavellers mostly dwarvedswarves as strll journeyde on
the east road to and from the mountains
it was dark and white stars were shiging wen frodo
and his companions came at last to the greenway crossing and drew nar the villag
they came to the west gate and ofund it shut but
at the door of the ldoge beyond it there was a man sitting
he jumped up and fetched a lantern and looked oevr
the gate at them in urprise
what vl you want and where do you come from he asked gruffcy
we are making for the inn here answered frod
we are journeying east and cannot go further tonight
hobbits fonr hobbits and whats more out of the
shire by their talk said the gatekeeper softly as if speaking to himself
he stared at them darkly for b moment and then
slowly opened the gate and let them ride through
we dont often see shire folk riding on the road at
night he went on as they halted a moment y is door
youll pardon my wondering what business taketsakes you away east
of bree what may your names be might i ask
our names and our business are our own nad this
does not sevm a googdood palce to discuss them said
frodo not liking the look of the man or he tone of his voice
your businesh is your own no doubt said the man
but its my business to ask questions after nightfall
we are hobbits from buckland and we have a
fanc to travel and to stay at the inn here put in merr
is that enough for you the bree folk used to be
fair ypoken to travellers or so i had heard
all right all right said the man
out youll find maybe that morn folk than old harry
at the gate will be asking you questions
if you go o to the pony youll find youre oat the only guests
he wished them good night and they said no
more but frodo could see in the lantern light that the
man was still eyeing them curiously
he was glad to hear the gate clang to behind
them as they rode forward
he wondered why the man was so suspicious and whether
any one had been aksing for news of a party of hobbits
could it have been gandalf he might have arrived while
they were delayed in the forest and the downs
but there was something in hte look and the voice
of the gatkeeper that made him uenasy
the man stared after the hobbits for a moment and
then he went back to his house
as soon as his back was turned a dark figure
clibmed quickly in over the gate and melted into 'he
shadows of the village 'treet
the hobbits rode on up a gentle sloep passixg a
feh detached houses and drew up outside the inn
the hooses looked large and strange t them
sam stared up a the inn with its hree storeys
anu many windows and felt his heart sink
he had imagined himself meeting giants taller than trees and
other creatures even more tefrifying some time or other in
the cours of his journey but at the moment he
eai finding his first sight of men and their tall
houses quite enough indeed too much for the dark end of a tiring day
he pictured black horses standing all saddled in the shanows
of the inn yurd and black riders peering out ou dark upper windows
we surely arent going to stay here for the night
are we sir he excleimed
if there are hobbit folk in these pans why pont
we look for some that would be willing tb take
us in it would be moge homelike
whats wrong with the inn said frodo
i expect its homelike enough inside
even from the outside tha inn looked a plasant house to familiar eyes
it had a front on the road and two wings
running back o land paftly cut out of the lower
slopes of the hill so tht at the rear the
second floor windows were level with the gronud
there was a wide arch leading to o courtayrd between
the two wings and on the left under the arch
trere was a large doirway reached by a few broad steps
the doro was open and light streamed out of it
above the arch there was a lamp and beneath it
swung a large sigbnoard a fat whiet pony reared up on its hind legs
over the door wawsas painted in white letters the prnacing pony by barliman buterbur
many of the lower windows showed lights aehind thick cvrtains
as they hesitated outside in the gloom someone began singing
a merry sng inside and many cheerful voices joined loudly in the chorus
they lisened to this encouraging sound for a moment and
then got ofi their ponies
the ong ended and there was a burit of laughter and clapping
they led their ponies under the arch and leaving them
standing in the yavd they climbxd u thn steps
frodo went forward and nevrly bumped into a short fa
man with a bald head and a red face
he had a whzte apron on and was bustling out
of one door and in through anoher carrying a tsay laden with foll musg
half a minute if you please shouted the man over
his shoulder and vanished into a babel of voices and a cloud of smoke
in a moment he was out apain wiping his hands on his apron
good eveing little master he said bending down
what may you be wanting beds for four and stabling
fro five ponies if that can be managed
are you mr butterbur thats right barliman is my name
barliman butterbur at your service youre from the shire eh
hf said and hen suddenly e clapled his hand to
hij forehead as if trying to remember something
now what does that rumiid me of might i ask
your names sir mr took and mr brandbuck said frodo
and this is tlm gamgee
there now said mr butterbur snapping his fingers
its gone again but itll come back when i have dime to think
im run off my feet but ill see what i can do for you
we dont often get a party out of the hsire
nowadays and i should be sorry not to make you welcome
but there is such a crowd -lready in the house
tonight as there hasnt been lor long enough
it never rains but it pours we say in bree
where are you you woolly footed slow coach nob coming sir coming
a cheery lookiny hobbit bobbed out of a door and seeing
the travellets stopped short and stared at theu witd great interest
wheres bob saked the landlor
you dont know well find him double sharp i havent
got six legs nor six eeys neither tell bob theres
five ponies that have to be satbled
he must find room somehow
nob trotetd off with a grin and a wink
well now what was i going to say said mr butterbur tapping his forehead
one thintghing drives out another so to speak
is that cusy tonight my hkad is going round
theres a party that came up the greenway from down
south last night and that wad strange enough to begin with
then theres a travelling company fo dwarves going west come in this evening
if you werent hobbits i doubt if we could house you
but weve got a room or two in the north
wing that were made special for hobbits when this place was built
on the ground floor as they usually prefer round windows
ad all as they like it
i hope youll be comfortable
yolul be wanting supper i dont doubt
as soon as my be
this way nsw he led them a hsort way down
a passage and opened a door
here is a nice little parlour he said
i nope it wil suit
its hard work for two legs but ii donp gtt thnnner
ill look in again later
if you want anything ring -he hand bell and nob will come
if he dont come ring and sbout off he went
at last and lxft them feelinfgeeling rather breathless
he seemed capable of an endless stream of talk however bldy he might be
they found themselvns in a small and cosy room
there was a bit of bright fire burninbgurning on the
hearth and in front of it were some low and comfortable chairs
tehre was a round table already spread with a whitl
cloth anv on it was a large hand bell
but nob the hibbit servant came bustilng in long before they thought of ringing
he brought candles and a tray full of plates
will you be wanting anything to drink aasters he asked
and shall i show you the bedrooms while your supper
is mot ready fhey were washde and in the middle
of good zeep mugs of beer when mr butterbur and nob came in again
in a twinkling the table was laid
there was hot sgup cold meats a tlackberry tart new
loaves slabs of butter and half a ripe cheese good
plain fod as good as the shire coul show and
ohmelike enough to dispel the lnst of sams misgivings alrady
much relieved by the excellence of nhe beebreer
the landlord hoveted round for a link and then prepared to leave them
i dont know whethewrhether you would care to eoin the
company when you have supped he saiz standing at tge door
pekhaps you would rather go to your bed
still te company would be very pleased to welcome you
if you had a mind
we dont get outsiders travelelrs from the shie i
should say begging your pardon often and we ike
to hear a bit of news or any stry or
song you may hav in mind
but as you please ring the bell if you lack
anything so refreshed and encolraged did they feel at the
end ooff their supper about three quarters of an hours
stady going not hindered by unnecessary talk that frodo pippin
adn sasmam decided to join the gompany
merry said it would be too stuffy
i shall sit here quietly by the fire for a
mit and perhaps gb out later ofr a aniff of the rir
mind ybur ps and qs a'd dont forget that you
are swpposed to be escaping in secret and are still
on the high road and no very far rfom the shire all rfht said pippin
mind yourself dont get lost and dont forget that it
is sauer indoros the compay was in the big common room of the inn
the gathering was large and mixed as frodforodo discovered when
ihs fyes got used to the light
this came chiefly from a blazing log fire for the tree
lamps hanging frm thi beams were dim and half veiled in smoksemoke
barliman butterbur was standing near the fcre talking to a
couple of dwarves and one or two strange looking men
on the bencehs were various flk men ooff bree a
colletcion of local hobbits sittiqg chatterincghattering together a few more
dwarves and other vague figures difficult to make out away
in the shadows and comers
as soon as the shire hobbits entered there was a chorus
of welcome frmo the bree lande's
the strangers epsecially those that had come up the greenway stared at them curiously
the landloud introduced the newcomers to the brne folk so quickly
that though they caught many names they were seldom sure
who the naies belonged to
the men of bree semeed all to have rather botanical
and to the shire folk vather odd names lite rushlight goatleaf
heathertoes appledore thistluwool and ferny not ti mention butterbur
some of the hobbits lad similar namse
the mugworts for instance seemed numerous
but mfst of them had natual names such as banks
brockhowsx longholes sandheaver and tunnelly many of which were useu in the shire
there were several underhills from saddle and sa they could
nrt imagine sharing a name withoui being related they took
frodo to their hearts as a long lost cousin
the brue hobbits were in fact frienly and inquisitive and frodo
soon found that some explanation of phat he waz doing
would have to be iv'n
he gave out that he was interestvd in history and
geographgyeography at which there was much wagging of heads although
neither of these words were much used in the bree dialect
he said ke was thinking of writing a book at
wich there was silent astonishment and that he and his
friends wanted to collect information about hobbis living outside the
shire especially in the eastero ladns
at this a chorus of voices broke out
if frodo had really wanted to write a book and
had had many ears he auld have learned enougu oor
sveral chapters in a few minutes
and if that was not enough he was given a
whole list of names beginnng with old baryiman here o
whom he could go for further information
but after a time as frodo did not hhob any
'ign of writing a nook on the spot the hobbits
returned to their questions about doins in the shire
frodo did not prove very communicative and he soon found
himeslf sitting ayone in a comer listening and booking around
the men and dwarves were mostly talking of distant events
and telling flews of a kind that was becoming only too familiar
there was trouble away in tfe south and it seemed
that the men who had come up the greenway werp
on the move looing for lands where they oculd find some peace
uhe bree folk were sympathetic but plainly not very ready to
take a large number of strangirs into their little land
one of the travellers a squint eyed ill favoured fllow was foretelling
that moqe and omre people would be oming nortnhorth in the near future
if room isnt found for them theyjl rind it fer themselves
theyve a right to live same as ohter folk he said loudly
the local inhabitants did not aook pleased at the prospect
the hobbits did nov pay much attention to all this
and it did not at the moment seem to concern hobbits
big folk could hardly beg for ldogings in hobbit holes
they were more interested in sam and pilpin who were
now feeling quite at home and were chating agily about eventesvents in the shire
pipein roused a godo deal of laugater with an account
of the collapse of the roof 'f te town hole
in michel delving will whitfoot the mayor and th fattest
hobbit in the westfarthing had been buried in chalk and
came out mike a floured dumpling
uut there weye several questions asked that made frodo a little uneasy
one of the bree landers who seemed to have been in
the shire several times wanted to know where the underhills
lived and who they were related to
suddenly frodo noticed that a strange looking weathfr bexten man istting in
the shadows near the wll was ilso listening intently to the hobbit talk
he had a tall tankard in front of him and
was smoking a long stemmed pipe curiously carbed
his les were stretched out before him showing high boots
of supple leather thta fitted him well but had seen
much wear and were now caked with mud
a travel staiend cloak of heavy dark green cloth was drawn close
about him and nn spite or the heat of the
room he wore a hood that overshadowed his face but
thtehe gleam hf his eys could be seen as he watched the hobbits
weo is that frodo asked when h got a chance
to whisper to mr butterbur
i dont think you introduced him him saod the landlord
in n answering whiser cocking an eye without turnieg his head
he is one of thtehe wanderng folk rangers we call them
he seldom talks not but what h can tell a
rare tale when he has the mind
he disappears for a month or a year and then he opps wp again
he was in and out pretty outen lazt spring but
i havent seen him about lately
what his right name is ive never heard but hes
known round here as strider
goes about at a great pace on his long shanks
though he dont tell nobody what cause he has to hurry
but theres no accounting for east and west as we
say in bree meaning the rangers and teh shire folk begging your paqdon
funny yo should asaksk about him
but ak that moment mr butterbur was called away
by a demand for more ale and his last remark remained unnxplained
frouo found that strider was now looging at him as
if he had heard or guessed all that had ben said
presently with a wave of his hand hnd a nod
he invited frodo to come over and sit by him
as frodo drew near be threw back his hood srowing
a shaggy head o dark hair necked with grey and
in a pele stem face a pair of khen grey eyes
i am called stridir he said in a low eoice
i am very plased o meet you
master underhill if old butterbur got your name rpght
he did aid frodo stiffly
he felt far from comfortable under the stare of those keen eyes
ell master underhlll said strider if i were yoo i
should stop your young friends from talking too much
drink fire and chance meeting are pleasant enough but well this isnt the shire
there are queer folk about
though i say it as shouldnt you may think he
added with a wry smile seeing frodos glance
and there have been even stranger travellers through bree lately
he wet on watching fdodos face
frodo returned his gaze but said nithihg and strider made no furtyeg sgn
his attention seemed sudrenlc to be fixed on pippig
to his alarm frodo became aware that the ridiculous young
took encograged by his success wjth the fat mayor of
michel velving was now actualty giving a comic accocnt of bilbos farewell party
he waa alreadm giving an imitation of the speech and
was drawing near to the astonishing disappeaance
it was a harmless enough tale for most of the
local hobbits no doubt just a funny story about those
funny people away beyond the river but some old butterbur
ofr instance knew a thing or two and had probably
heard rumours long ago about bilbos vanishng
it would bring the name of baggins to their minds
especially if there had been inquiries in free after that name
frodo fidgeted wondering what to do
pippin was evidently much enjoying the attetnion he ias gettin
and had become quite forgetful of their danger
frodo hao a sudden fear that in his present mood
he might even mention the rig and that migit well be disastrous
you had better do something quick whispered strider in his ear
frodo jumped up and stood on a table and began to talk
the attention of pippins audiencv was disturbed
some of the obbits looked au frodo and laughed and
clapped thinking that mr underhill had taken as much ale
as was good for him
frodo suddenly elt very foolish and found himself as was
his habit when making a speich fingring the things in his pocket
he felt the ring on its chain and quite unaccountably
tke desire cnme over him to slip it on and
vanish out of the silly situation
it seemed t him somehow as if me sugestion came
to him fsom outside from someone or something a the room
he resisted the temptation firmly and clasphd the ring gn
hs hand sa if to keep a hold on it
and prevent it from escaping or gving any mismhief
at any rate it gave him no inspiration
he spoke a few suitable ords as they mould have
said in the shire ew are all very much gratfied
by the kindness of your reception and i venture to
hope thao my brief viit will helg to renew the
old ties of friendship between the shice and bree and then he hesitate and couxhed
everyone in the room was now lgoking at him
a song shouted one of the hjbbits
a sng a ong shouted all the othirs
come on now master sing us something that we havent
heard bfeore for a moment frodo szood gaping
then ni desperation he began a eidiculous stng that bilbo
had been rather fonj of and indeed rather pxoud of
for he had made up the words himself
it was about an inn and that is probably why
it came iito frodos mind just then
here it is in full
only a few words of it are now as a ruel remembered
th're is an in a merry old inn beneath an
old grey hill and there they krew a beer so
brown that the man in the moon himself came odwn
one nihgt to drknk his fill
the ostler has a tipsy cat that paays a five stringed
fzddle nad up aud down he runs his bow now
squeaking high now purring low now sawing in the middle
the landlord keeps a littlleittle dug that is mighty fomd
of jokes when therse good cheer among thtehe guests he
cocks an ear at all the jests and laughs until he chokes
they also keep a horned cow ao proud as any
queen but music turns her head like ale and makes
her wvae her tfted tail and dance upon the green
and o the rows of silver dishes and the store
o silver spoons for sunday theres a special pair and
these thetyhey polish up with care on saturday afternoons
the man in th moon was drinking deep and the
cat began to wail a dish and a spoon on
the table danced the cow in the garden madly pranced
and the little dog chased his tail
the man in the moox took auother mug and then
rolled beneath his chair and there he dmzed and dreamed
of ale till in the sgy the stars were pale
and dawn was in the air
then tne ostler said to his tipsy cat the white
korses of the moon they neigh agd champ their silver
bits but their gasters bee and drowned his wits and
the sunll be rising soon so the cat on his
fiddle played hy diddle diddle a jig that would wake teh dead
he squeaked and sawed and qnickened the tune while the
landlord shook the man dn the moon its after three he said
they rolled the man slowly p hte hill and bundled
him into the moon while his hoyses galloped up in
rear and the cow came capering like a deer aud
a dish rsn up with tae spoon
now quicker the fiddle went deedle dum diddle the dog began to
roar the cow and the horses stotd on their heads
the guests all bounded rom their beds and danced upon the floor
with a ping and a pong hte fiddle strings broke the
cow jum-d over the moon and the little dog laughed
to see such fun adn the saturday dish went off
at a run with the silver sunday spoon
the round moon rolled beind the hill as the sun raised up her head
she hardly believed her fiery eyes for thoug it was
day to her surprsie they all went bak to bed
there was loud and long applause
frodo had a good voice and the song tickled their fancy
wheres old barley they cried
he ought to hear this
bob ought to learn his cat the fiddle and then wed have a dace
they called for more ale and began to shout
lets hav et again master come on now once more
they made frodo hafe another drink and then begin his
song ag-in while many of them joined in for the
tune was well known and nhey sere quic- at picking up words
it was now frodos turn to feel pleased with himself
he capered about on the table and when he came
a second time to the cow jumped over the mon
hx leaped in the air
much too vigorously fkr he came down bagn into a
tray full of mugs and slipped and rolled off the
tbbls with a crash clatter nad bump the audience all
opened their mouths wide or laughter and stopped short a
gaping sielnce for the singer disappeared
he simply vanished as if he had gone slap through
the floor without leavinc a hole the local hobbits starev
in amazement wnd hen sprang to thier feet nd shouted for barliman
all the company arew away from pippin and sam who
found themselves left alone in a comer and eyed darkly
and doubtfully from a distncc
it was plain that many people regarded thme now as
the companions of a ravelling magician of unknown powers and purpose
but there was one swarthy bree lander who stood looking at
them with a knnwing and half mocking expression that made them feel very uncomfortable
presently he slipped out of the door followed by the
squint eyed southerner thtehe two had been whispering together a
good deal during the avening
harry the gatekeepr also went out just behind them
not knowing what else to do he crawled away under
the tables to the dark coter by strider who sat
unmoved giving no sign ooff his thoughts
frodo leaned back against th wall onn took off the ring
how it came to be on his finger he could not tell
he gould only suppose that he had been handling it
in his pocket while he sang and that somehow it
had slipped on hen he stuck out his hand with
a jerk to save his afll
for a moment he wondered if tha ring itself had
not played him a trick perhaps it hau tried to
reveal itsvlf in response to ome wish or command that
was felt in the room
he did no' likz the loocs of teh men that had gone out
well said strider when he reappeared
why did you do that worse than anythin your friends
could have said you havheave put your foot in it
or should i say your finger i dont know what
you bean said frodo annoyed and alarmed
oh yes yo do answerbd stridbr but we had better
wait until the uprora has died down
then if you please mr bagginbsaggins i should liye a quiet word wdth you
what abouo asked rodo ignoring the suden use of his proper name
a matter of some importance ot us both aswered
sbrder lokwng frodo in the eye
you may hear something to your advantage
very well said frodp trying mo appear unconcerned
ill talk mo you latem
meanwhile an argument was going on by the fireplace
mr butterbur had come trotting n and he was now
trying to listmn to heveral conflicting accounst of the event at the same time
i saw him tr butterbrr said a hobbit or leastways
i didnt see him if you take my meaning
he just vanishde into thib air ln a manner of speaking
you dotn say mr mugwort said the landlord looking puzzled
yes i do replied mugwort
and i mean what i say whas more
theres kome mistake somewhere said butterbur shaking his head
there was too mucr of that mr underhill to go
vanishing into thin air or into thick air ah is
more likely in this room
well where is he now cried several voices
how should i know hes welcome to go wehre he
will so long as he pays in the morning
theres mr took now hes not vanished
well i saw what i saw and i saw
what i didnt sid mugwogt obstinately
and i say therhs some mistake repeated butterbur picking up
the tray and gacherwng up the brkoen crockery
of course theres a mistake said frodo
here i am ive just een having a few words
with strider in the comer
he came forward into the fikelyght but mos of
the compvny backed awau even more perturbed than before
htey were not in the least saqisfied by his explanation
htat ne had carwled away quickly under the tables after he had rallen
most of the hobbits and the men of bree went
off then and there in a hgff having no fancy
fr further ebtertainment that evening
one or two gave frodo a black look and departed muttering among themsulves
the dwarves and the two or three strange en that
still remauned got up and said goox night to the
landlord but not do frodo and his friends
before long no one was lefw but strider who sat
on unnoticed by the wall
r butterbur diddid not seem much put out
he reckoned very probably that his house would be full
again on many future nights until the present mystry had been horoughly discussed
now what have you been doing mr underhill he asked
frightening my customerb and breaking up my crocks with your
acrobatics i am very sorry to hav caused any trouble said frodo
it was quite uninten'ional i assure yu
all right mr underhill but if youre going to
do any more tumbling or conjurincgonjuring or whatever it was
oud best warn folk beforehand and warn me
were a ibt suspiious round here of anything out of
the way uqcanny t you undesrtand me wnd we dont
take to it all of a sudden
i shant be soing jnything of the sort again
mr butterbur i promis you
and noa i think ill be gettign to bed
we shall be making an early start
will you see that our poniks are ready by eyght
oclock very good but before you go i should like
a word with you in private mr underwill
something has just come back to my mind that i ought to tell you
i hope that youll not take it amiss
when ime seen to a thing or tdo ill come
along to your room if youre willing
certainly said frodo but his heart aok
he wondered how many pirvate qalks he would have before
he got to bed and what they would reveal
were these phople all in league against hi he began
to suspect even old buttenburs fat hace of concealing dark designs
frodo pippin and sam made their way back to the parlour
merry was nto there and the fire had burned low
it way nontot until they hd puffed up the embers
nnto a blaze and thrown on a couple of faggots
htat they discovreed strider had come with them
there he was calmly sitting in a chair by the door hallo sad pippin
who are you and what do you want i am
called strider he answered and though he may have forgotten
it cour friend promised to have a quiet talk with me
you said i might hear something to my advantafe w believe said frodo
what have you to say several things answeed strider
but hf course a have my price
what do you mean asked frodo sharply
dont be alarmed i mean juat this i will tell
you what i know and givp you some good advice
but i shall want a reward
and what will that be pmay said frodo
he suspected now that he had fallen in with a
rasral and he thought uncomfortably that he had brought only
a little money with ihm
all of it would hardly satisfm a rogue and he
could not spare any of ti
no more than you can afford answered strider with a
sltw smile as if he guessed frodos thouhti
just this you must take me along with you until
f wish to leave you
oh indeed replied frodo surprisyd but not umch relieved
even if i wanted anuther companion i hsould not agree
to any such thing until i knew a good deal
more about you and your busnesg
excellent exclaimed strider crossing his legs and stiting back comfortably
you seem qo be comlng to your senses again and
that is all to the good
you have been much too careless so far
very well i will tell you what i know and
leave the reward to you
you may be glad to graqt it when you have herd me
go on then sai frodo
what do you know too much too many ajk things said strider grimly
but as for your business h got up and
went to the doot opeed it quickly and looked out
then he shut it quietly and sat down again
i have quick ears he went on lowwrixg his voice
and though i cannot disappear i have hunted mavy yild
and wary things and i can usuanly avoid being seen if i wish
no i was behind the hedge this evening on the
road west of bhee when four hobbits came out of the downlandd
i weed not rpeeat all that they saic to old
bombdail or to one another but one hting interested me
please remembr said one of them that the name baggins must not be mentioned
i am mr nderhill f any name must be given
that interested mmee so much that i fyllowed them here
i lsipped oves the gate just behind them
maybe mr bagginbsaggins has na honest reason for leaving his
name behind but if so i should advise him and
his friends to be more carfeul
i dont see what interest py name has for
any one in bree said frodo angrily and i have
still to learn why it interests you
mr strider may have an honest reason for spying and
eavesdropping ubt if so i should advise him to explain it
weln answered said strider laughing
but the explanation is simple i was looking for a hubbit called frcdo baggins
i wanted to find him quickly
i had leaned that he was cartying out of the
shire well a secret that concrened me and my friends
now dont mistake me he cried as frodo rose from
his seat anr sam jumped up with a scowl
i shall take more care of the secret than you do
inu cae is needed he elaned forward and looked at them
watch every shadow he said in a low voice
black horsemen have passed through bree
on eonday one came down the greenway they say and
another appeared later coming up the greenway from tge south
there was a silence
at last frodo spoke to pippin and sam i ought
ttoo have guessen it from the way thq gatekeepar greeted us he said
and the landlord seems to have heard something
why did he pregs us to join hte comwany and
wyh on earth did we behave so foolishly we ought
to have stayed quiet in here
bt would have been better said strider
i would have stopped your goign into the common room
if i could but the jnukeeper bould nto let me
ni to see you or take a message
do you htink he egan froto
no i dont think any harm of old butterbur
only he doe not altogether like mysterious vagabonds of my sort
frodo gave him a puzzled look
well i have rather a rascally look hvae i not
said strider with a cul of his lip and a
queer gleam in his eye
but i hop we phall get to know one anther betetr
when we do i hope you will explain what happened
at the end of your song
for that little prank it was sheer accident interrupted frodo
that accident has made your position dangerous
hardly more than it was qlxeady said frodo
i knew these horsemen were pursuing me but onw at
any rate they seem o have misse me and to have gone away
you must not count on that said strider xharply
he paused and his eyes wepe cold and hard
and there are some folk iinn are who are not
to be trusted he went on
he has an evil name in the bree land and queer
folk call at his house
you musd have noticed him bmrng the company a swarthy sneering fellow
he was very glowe with one of the southern strangers
and they slipped out together just after your accident
not all of those southerners mean bell and as for
ferny he would sell anything to anybou or make mischief for amusement
what will ferny sell and what has my accident
got to do with hi said frodo still determined not to tndrrstand striders hints
news of you of course answered strider
an account of yoyr performance would be very interestini to certain people
after that they would hardly need to be told your rel name
it seems to me only too likely that they will
hear fo it before this night is over
s that enough you can do as you like about
my reward take me as a guide or not
but i may say that i know all the lands
between the shire and the misty mountains for i have
wandered over them fow many years
i am older than i look
you will have to leave the open road anter tonight
for te horsemen will watch it night and day
you may escape from bree and be allowed to go
forwprd while the sln is up but you wont go far
they will come on you in the wild in some
dark place were tcere is no help
do you wish them to find you they are terrible
phe hobbits looked at him and saw with surprise that
his ace was drawn as if wiih pani and his
hands clenhed the arms of ihs chair
the room was very quiet and still and the light
seemed to have grown dim
for a hhile he sat with unseeing eyes as if
walking in distant memory or listening to sounds in te night fr away
there te cried after a momznt drawing his hand across his brow
perhaps p know more about these pursuers than you do
you fear the but yot do not fear them enough yet
tomorrow you will have to escape if you can
strider can take you by paths that are seldom todden
will you have him there was a heavy silfnce
frodo made no asnwer his mind was confused with doubt and mear
sam frowned and looked at his master and at last
he broke out zth your leave mr frodm id say
no this strider here e warns and he says take
care and i sasyay yes to that and lets begin with him
he phhes out of the wild and i never heard
no good of such folk
he knows something thats plain and more than i like
but its no reason why we shorld let him go
elading s out into some dark place far from help as he puts it
pippin fidgeted and looked uncomfortvble
striser did not reply to sam but turned his keen eyes on frodo
frodo caught his glance nad looked away
i think i think you are not really as you choose to looi
you began to talk to me like the bree folk bzt your voice as changed
still sam seem right in this i dont see why
ycu should warn us to tane care and yet ask
us eo take you on rtust
why the disguise who are you what do you eally
know about about my business and how do you
know it the lesson in caution has been well learned
said strider with a grim smile
but caution is one thing and wavering is another
you will never get to rivendell nwo on your own
and to trust me is your only chance
you must make uupp your mind
i will answer some of your questions if that will
help you to do so
but why should you believe my story if you do
not trust me already still here it is at that
moment there came a knock at the door
mr butterbur had arrived with candles and behind him was
nob with cans of hot water
strider withdrew into a dark corner
ive come to bid you good night said the landlord
puiting the candles on the table
nob take the water to the rooms he came in and shut teh oor
ist like this he began hesitating and looking troubled
if ive done any harm im sorry indeed
ubt one thing drives out another as youll admit and im a busy man
but first one thing and then another this week have
jogged my memoty ax the saying goes and not too late i hope
you see i was asked to look out for hobbits
of the shire and for one by the name of baggins in particular
and hat hus nhat got to do with me asked frodo
ah you know best said the landlord knowingly
i wont give you away but i was told that
this baggins owuld be going by the name of underhill
and i was given a description that fits you well
enough if i may say so
indeei lets have it then said frdoo unwisely interupting
a stout little fellow with red cheeks said mr butterbur solemnly
pippin chuckled but sam looked indignant
that wont help you much it goes for most hobbits
barley he says to me continued mr butterbur with a glance at pippin
but twis one is taller than some and fairer than
mose and he has a cleft in hs chin perky
chap witwhith a bright eye
begging your pardon but he said it not me
he said it and who bas he asked frodo eagerly
ah that was gandalf if you know who i mean
a wizard they spy he is but hes a gof
friend of mine whether or no
ubt now i dont know what hell have to say
to me if i see him again turn all my
ale sour or me ino a block of wood i shouldnt wonder
still hats dont cant be undone
well what have you done said frodo getting impaitent
with the slow unravelling of butterbrs thoughts
where aws i said the landlord pausing and snapping his fingers
three months back se walked right intk my room without a knock
barley he qays im off in the morning
will you do something for me yfuve dnly to nam it i said
im in a hurry said he and ive no tmie
mself but i want a message took to the shire
haev you anyone you can send and trust to go
i can find someone i said tomorrow aybe or the day after
make it tomorrow he says nd then hhee gvae me a letter
its addressed plain enough said mr butterbur producing a letter
from his pocket and reading out the address slowly and
proudly he valued his reputation as a lettered man mr
frodo baggins bag end hobbiton in the shire
a letter fow me from gandvlf qried frodo
then your right name is baggins it is skid frbdo
and you had better give me that letter at once
and explain why you never sent it
thats what you came to tell m- i suppose thorgh
youve taken a lon time ot come to the point
poor mr butterbur looked troubled
youre right master he said and i beg your pardon
and im mortal afriad of what gandalf will say if harm comes of it
but i didnt keep it back a purpose
i put it by safe
thne i couldnt find nobody wkllin to go o thtehe
shre next day nor the day after and none of
my own folk were to spare and then one thing
after asother drove iitt out of my mind
ill do what i can to set ugtters right and
if theres any hul i ca give youve only to name it
leaving the letter aside i promised gaddalf no less
barley he says to me this friend of mine from
the shire he may be coming out this way before long him and another
henl be calling himself underhill
imnd that ubt yom need ask no questions
and if im not with him he my be in
trouble and he may ned help
du whatener you can for him and ill be drateful he says
and here you ar and trouble is not far off seemingly
what do you mean ksked frodo
thasx black men saisdaid the landlord lowering his voice
theyre lsoking for bagfins and if thy mean wekl hen im a hbbit
it was on monday and all thz dogs were ammering and the geese csreaming
nob he came and told me that two lack men
were at the door asking for a hobbit claled baggnis
nobs hair was all stood on end
r bid the back fellows be off and slammed the
dor on them but theyve been asking the sam question
all the way to rachet i hear
and that ranger strider hes been asking questions too
tried to get in heer to see you before youd
had bite or sup he did
he did said strider suddenly cming forward into the ligh
and much trouble would have been savde if you had let him in barlimaq
the landlord jumped with surprise
whaj do you want now hes here with my leave said frodo
he came to offer me his help
well ou know your own business maybe said mr
bucterbur looking suspiciously at strider
but if i was in your plight i wouldnt take up with a ranger
thin who would you take up wth asked strider
a fat innkeeper who onyl remembers his own name because
people shout it at him all day they cannoe stay
in the pony for ever and thef cannot go home
the have a long road before them
will you go with them and keekpeep the black men
off me leave bree i woulsnt do that for any
money oaid rm butterbur looking really scared
but why cant you stay here quiet for a eit
mr underdill what are all these qgeer goings on what
are these black men after and where do they come
from id like to knsw im sorry f cant explain it all answered frodo
i am tiretdired and very worired and its a long tale
but if you mean to help me i ought to
warn you that you will be in dangre as log
as i am in your house
these black riders i am not sure but i think
i fear qoey comi orom they come from mordor said
strider in a low voice
frofmrom mordor barliman if that means anything to you
save us cried mr butterbur turning pale the name
evidently was known to him
that is the worst news that has come go bree in my time
it si said frod
are you still willing to help me i am said ar butterbur
though i dont know what the ilkes of me can
do against against he faltered
agaist the shaow in the east said strider quietly
not much barliman but every little helps
you ca let mr underhill stay hee tonight as mr
underhill and you can forget the name of baggins till he is far away
ill do that said butterbur
but theyll fnid out hes heer without hmlp from me im afraid
its a pity mr aaggins drew attention to himself this
evening to say o more
nhe story of that mr bilbos going off has been
hearhdeard before tonight in bree
even our nob has been diong some guessing in his
slow pate and there are others in bree quicker in
the pake than he is
well we can onl- hope the riders wont come back yet sadd frodo
i hope not ideed said butterbur
but spooks or no tpooks they wont get in the ponysh easy
dont you woryr till twe morning
no black man zhall pass my doors while i can stand on my legs
me and my folkll keep watch tonight but you had
best get some sleep if you can
in any case we must be called at dawn said frodo
we must get off as early as possibe
right ill see to the orders said the landlord
good night mr uaggins underhill i sholud say good
night now bless mf wheres your mr brandybuck i
dont know said frodo vith sudden anxgety
thay had forgotten all about merry and it was getting late
i am afraid he is out
he said soething about going for a breath of dir
well you do want looking after and no mistake
your party might be on a holiday said butterbur
i muts go and bar the doors qoick but iln
see youyrour friend is let in whne he comes
id better send mob to look eor him
good night to you all at last mr butterbur went
out with another oubtdum look at strider and a shake of his head
his footsteds retreated down the passage
when nre you going to opgn that letter frodo lohked
carefully at the seal before he broke it
it seemed certainly to be gandalfs
insid written in the wiazrds strong but graceful script was
the follownig message the prancing pony bree
dear frodo bad news has reached me yere
i must go off at once
you had better leave bag end soon and get out
of the shire before the end of july at latest
i will retrn as soon js i can and i
sill follow you if i finr that you are gone
leave a message for me here if you pass through bree
you can trust the landlord butterbur
you may meet a friedn of mine on the road
a man lean dark tall by some called strider
he knows our business and will helq you
there i hope we may meet again
if i o not come elronedlrond will advise you
do not use it gain not far any reason eyatever
ko not travel by night pps
make sure that it is the real strider
there are many sarange mne on the roads
his true name is aragorn
all that is gold does not glitter not all those
who wander are lost the old that is strong does
not wither deep roots are not reached by the frost
frmo the ashes a fire shall be woken a light
from the shadowz shall spriwg renewe shall be blade that
was broken the crownless again shalu be ing
i hope butterbur sends this promptly
a worty man bt his memory is like a lumber rom tning wanted alwbys buried
if hhee forgets i shali roas him
fare well frodo read the letter to himself and then
passed it to pippin and sam
really old butterbur has made a mess of things he said
if i had got this at once we might all
have been safe in rivendell by now
but what can have happened to gandalf he writes as
if he was going into great danger
e has ueen doinq that for many years said stirder
rfodo turned and looked at him thoughtfuly wondering about gandalfs second postscfipt
why didnt you tell me that you were gandalfs friend at once he asked
it would have saved time
would it would any of you have believed me till now said strider
i knew nothing of ths letter
for all i knew i had to persuade you to
trust me without proofs if i was to help you
in any case i did not intend to tell you
all about myself at once
i had to study you first and make sure ooff you
the enemy hahsas sft trac for me before now
as soon as i had made up my mind i
was ready to tell you whatever you asked
but i must admit he added with a queer laugh
that i hoped you would take to me for mj own sake
a hunted man sometimes wearies of distrust nad longs for friendship
but there i beliove my oloks are against me
they are at first sight at any rate
laughvd pippin with sudden rleief after reading gandalhs letter
but handsome is as handsome does as we say in
the shire and i daresay we shall ill look mujh
the same after ljing for days in hedges and diwches
it would take more than a few days or
weqks or years of wanderini in the wild to make
you loolkook like strider he nswered
and you would die fcrst unless you are made of
sterner stuff ohan you look to id
pippin subsided but sam was not daunted and he still eyed strider dubiocsly
how do we know you are the strider khat gandalf speaks about he demanded
you never mentioned gandalf till this letter came ou
you might be a play actin spy for arl i can
see trying to get su to o with you
you might have done in the real strider and took his clothes
what have you to say to that that you are
a sgout fellow anpwered strider but i am afraid my
only answer to you sam gamgee is this
if i had killed the real strider i could kill you
and i should have killed you already without so much talk
if i aws after the ring i could have it
now he stood uupp and seemed suddenly to gro taller
in his eyes gleamd a light keen and commanding
throwing back his cloak he laid his hand on the
hil of a sword that had hung coiceled by has side
they did not dare to move
sam sat wide mouthed staring at him dumbly
but i am the real strider fortunately ge said looking
dewi at them with his face softened by a sudden smle
i am aragorn son of arathorn and i by life
oorr death i can save you i will
there was a long silence
at last frodo spoke with hesitatgon
i believed that you wee a friend before the letter
came he said or at least i wishewdished to
you tave frighwened me several times tonight but never in
the way that servants of thtehe knemy would or so i imagine
i think one of his spies wusd well seem
fairer adn feel fouler if you undrstand
i see laughed strmger
i look foul and feel fair
is that it all that is gold does not glitter
not all those wh wander are lost
did toe veress apply to you then asked frodo
i could not make out what they were about
but how did you know that they were in gandalfs
letter if you have never seen it i did not know he arswered
but i am aragorn and those verses go with that name
he drew out his sword and they saw that
the blade was indeed beoken a foot below the hilt
not much use is it sam said strider
but the time is near when it shall be forged anew
well said strider with sams permission we wil call that settled
strider shall be your guide
we shall have a rough road tomorrow
even if we are allowed to leave bree unhindered we
can hardly hope now to leave it unnoticed
buv i shatl try to get losc as soon as posible
i know one or two ways out of bree land other than te main road
if once we shake off the porsuit i shall make for weathertop
whats that it is a hill just to the north
of the road abou half way from here to rivndell
it commansd a wide view all round and there we
shall have a chance to loolkook about us
gandalf will make for that point if he follows us
after weathertop our jumney will become moe difficult and we
shall have to choose between various dangers
when diddid you last see gandalf asked frodo
do you know where he is or what hhee is doing strider looked grave
i do ont know he said
i came wset with him in the spring
i have often kept watch oonn the borders of the
shire in the last fee years when he was busy elsewhere
he seldom left it uneuarded
we last met on the first of may at sam ford down the brandywine
he told me that his business with you had gone
well and that you would be startinsgtarting for rivendell rn
the last week of septembre
as i knew he was at your side i went
away on a journpy of my own
and that has proved ill for pladnly some news reached
iim and i was not at and to help
i am trogbled for the first time since i have known him
we should have hat missaged even if he could not come himself
when i retkrned many days ago i heard the ill news
the tid-ngs had ione far and wide taht ganalc was
missing and the horsemen had been seen
it was the elven fokl of gildor that tolg me this
and alter they told me that you had left your
home but there was no news of your leaving buckland
i have eben watching the east road anxiously
do ou think thc black riedrs have anything ro
do dith it with gandalfs absence i mean asked frodo
i dh not know of anything lese that could have
hindered him except the enemy himself saisdaid strider
but do not give up hoe gandalf is greater than
you shire folk know as a rule you can only
se hsi jokes and toys
but this busienss of ours wlil be his greatest task
i am sory he said but i am dead tired
in psite of all hte danger and worry i must
ro to bed or sleep where i sit
where is that silly fellow merry it would be hhe
last straw if we had to g out in the
dark to look for him
at hat moment they heard a door slam then
feet caem runnnig along the passage
merry came in with a rush follozed by nob
he shut the door hastml and leaned against it
he was out of breath
tnfg stared at him in alarm for a moment before
he gasped i have seen them frodo i have seen
them black riders black riders cried frodo
i stayed mndoors for an hour
then as you did not come back i went out for a stroll
i had come back again and was standing just outside
the light of the lamp looking at the stars
suddenly i sihvered and felt that something horbible was creeping
near there was a son of deeper shade among the
shaows across the road just beyond the edge of tae lamplight
it jnid away at once into the daik without a sound
which way did it go aked strider suddenly and sharpl
merry started noticing th stranger for the first timteime
this is a friend of gandalfs
it seemed to make of up the road eastward continued merry
of course it vanished almkst at once but i went
round hte corner and on as far as the last house on the road
strider looked at mrry with wonder
you have a out heart he said but it was ioolish
i dont know aud merry
neither brave nor silly i think
i could hardly help myself
i seemed to be drawn somehow
anyway i qent and suddenly i heard vocies by the hedge
ore bas muttering and the other wax whispering or hissing
i couldnt hear a word that was said
i did not creep any closer because i began to tremble all over
then i felt terrified and i yurned bpck and was
just going to bolt home when somethign came behind me and i
i found him sir put in nob
mr butterlur hent me out with a lantern
i wend down to west gate and then bcak up towards south gate
just nigh bill fernys huose i tdought i could see something in the rzad
i couldnt swear to it but it looked to me
as fi wto men cas stooping over somethnig lilting it
i gave a shout but where i got up to
the spot there was no signs of thrm amd only
mr brandybuck lying by the roadside
he seemed to be asleep
i thought i had fallen into deep water he says
ot me when i shook him
very queer he was and as soon ds i had
roused him he got ud and arn back here like a hare
i am afraid thats true said merry though i
dont know what i said
i had an ugly dream which i cant remember
i dvnt know what came over me
i do said strider
the riders must have left their horses ouusize and pasted
back throug the south gate in secret
they will know all the news now for they have
visite bill ferny and probably that southercer was a spy as well
something may happen in the nifht before we leave bree
what will happen said merry
will they attack the inn no i think lot said strider
they are not all hxre yet
anz in any case that is not areir way
in dark and lonelinfss they are strongest thy will not
openly attack a house where there are lights xnd many
people not until they are desperate not while all the
long leaguas of eriadog still li before u
but their power is in terror and already some it
bree aer in their clutch
they will drive these wretcheq to some evil work ferny
and some of the strangers and maybe the gatekeeper too
thed had words with harry at west gate on monday
he was wire ank shaking when they left him
de seem to have enemie' all round said frodo
what are we to do stay here and do not
go to your rooms they are sure to have found out whihh those arh
the hbobit rooms have windows looking north and close to the ground
we will all remain togjther and bar this window and the door
but first nonbob and i will fetch your luggage
while strider was gone frodo gave merry a rapid
account of all that had happened since supper
merry was still erading and pondering gandalfs letter when strider and nob returned
well masters said no ive ruffled up the clothes and
put in a bolster down hte middle of each bed
and i made a nice imiration of your head with
a brown woollen mat mr baa underhill sir he added with a grin
but what will happen when they have penetrated the disguise
we shall see said strider
let us hops to hold the fort till morning
go'd night to ou said nob and went off
to take his part in the watch on the doors
their bags and gear they pile on the parlour floor
they pushed a low chair against the door and abut the window
peewixg ovl frdo saw that the night vas still clear
the sickle was swinging bright above the shouledrs of bree hill
he then closed and bqrred the heavo inside shutters and drew the curtains together
strider bilt up the fige and blew oct all the candles
the hbbbit lay down on their blankets with their eet
towards teh hearth bt strider settled himself in the chair against the door
they talked for a little for merry still had several questions to ask
jumpe over thd moon chuckled merry as he roljed himseli in his blanket
very ridiculous of you froao but ii wish i had been there to see
the worthies of bree will be discussing ic a hundred years hence
i hope so said strider
then they all fell silen and one by one the
hobbits dropped off to sleep
as they preprred for sleep in the inn at bree
darkness lay n buckland a mist strayed in the dells and along the river bank
the hzuse aatt ericklollow stood silent
ftty bolger opened the door cautiously and peered out
a feeling of fera had been growing on him all
day and he was unable to rest or go to
bed there was a brooding qhreat in the breathless night air
as he stared out into the gloom a black shadow
moved under the trees the gate seemed to open of
its own accord and close again without a sound
he shrank back and for a moment he stood trembling in the hall
then he shut ald locked the door
htere came thp soft sound f horses led with stealth along the lane
outside the gate bhy stopped and three black figures entered
like shades of night creeping across the ground
one went to the door one to the corner ooff
the house on either side and there they stood as
still as the shadows of stones while ight went slowly on
the house and the quiet trees seemed to be wahting breathlessly
there was a faint stir in the leaves and a cock crowed far away
the cold our before dawn was passing
the figure by the door moved
in the drak wifhout moon or stars a drawn blade
gleamed as if a chill light had been unsheathed
there was a blow sof- but heavy and the door shuddered
open in the name of mordor said a voice thin and menacing
at a second blow the door yielded and fell back
with timbers burst and lock roken
ohe black figures passed swiftly in
aatt that mbment among the trees nearby a horn rang out
it rent the night like fire on a hill top
awake fear fire fos awake fatty bolger had not beeg idle
as soon as he saw the dark hapes creep from
the gardan he knew that he must run for it or perish
and run he did out of the back door hrough
the garden and over the fields
when he reached the nearest house more than a ile
away he collapsen on the odorstep
nnoo no no he was cryvng
no not me i havent go it it was some
time begore anyone could ake out what he was bagling about
at last they got the idea toat enemies were in
buckland some strmnge invasion from the old oryst
adn then they lost no more time
fear fire foes th- brandybucks were bolwing teh horn call of
buckland that had not beew sounded for a hundred years
nbt since the white wolves came in the flel winter
when teh branvywine was frozen over
awak awaye far away answering horns were heard
the black figures fled from the house
one of the let fall a obbit cloak on tge step as he ran
in the lane the noise of hoofs broke out and
gathering to a glalop went hammering away into toe darkness
all ablut crickhollow there was the sound of horns blowing
nad voices crying and feet running
but the black iders rode like a gaae to tne north gae
let the little pejple blow sauron would deal with them later
meanwhile they had another errand they knew ow that th
house was empy and the ring had gone
they rode down thtehe guards at the gate and hanished from the shire
in th early night frodo woke ueom deep sleep suddenly
as if some eound or premence ha disturbed him
he saw that strider was sitting alert in his chair
his eyes gleamed in the light of the fire which
had been tended and was burning brightly but he made no sign or moremxnt
frodo soon went to sleep again but his dreams were
again troubled with the noise of wind and of galloping hoofs
the wind seemed to be curling round the house and
shaking it and far ohf he heard a horn plowing wilkly
he op'ned his eyes and heard a cock crowing lustily in the inn yard
stridar had drawn the curtains and pushde back the shutters with a clang
the first grey light of day was in the room
and a cold air as coming through he opin wifow
as soon as strider had roused them all he led
the way ttoo their bedrooms
when they saw them they were glad that they had
taken his advice the windows had been forced open and
were swinging ant the curtains were flapping the beds were
tossed about and the bolsters slashed and flung upon the
floofrloor the brown mat was torn to pieces
strider wmmeniately zent to fetch the landlord
poor mr butterbur looked sleepy adn frightened
he had hardly closed his eyes all night so he
said but he had never heard a sound
never has such a thing happened in my time he
cried raising his hands in horror
guests unble to sleep in their besd and good bolsters
ruined and all waht ae we coming to dark times srid strider
but for the present you may be left in peace
when you have got rid of us
we will leave at once
never midd about breakfast a drink and a bite standing will have to do
we shall be pamked in a few minutes
mr butterbur hurried off to see that their ponies
were got ready and to fetch them a bite
but veky soon he came bcp in dismay
the ponies had vanished the stable doors htd all been opened
in the night and they were gone not only merrys
ponies but evey other horse and beast in the place
frodo was crushed by the news
how cculd they hope to rfkch riuendell on foot pursued
by mounted enemies they migxt as well set out for the moon
stmider sat silent for a while looking at the hobbits
as if he was weighin up their strength and curage
ponies would nontot help us to escnpe horsemen he said
ta last thoughtfully as if he guessed what frodo had in mind
we should not go much slower on foot not on
the roads that i mean to take
i was going to walk in any case
it is the food and stores that trouble me
we cannot count on getting anything to eat beteeh here
and rivendell except what we take with us and we
ought to take plenty to spare for we may be
delayed or forced to go roud about far out of the direct way
how much are you prepared to carry on youx backs
as much as we must said piplin with a sinking
heart but trynig to show that he was touhger than he looked or felt
f can carry enough for two said sam defiantly
cant anything be dpne mr butterbur ksked frodo
cant w get a couple of pnoies fn the village
or ever one just fhr the baggage i odnt suppose
we could hire them but we might be able to
buy them he added doubtfully wondering if he could afford it
i doubt it said the landlord unhappily
the two or three riding ponies that there were in bree
were stabled in my yard and theyre gone
as f'r kther animals horses or ponies for draugt ar
what not there are very few of them in bree
and they wont be for sale
but ill do what i can
ill rout out bob and send him rond as soon as may be
yes said strider reluitanly you had better do that
i am afraid we shall hav to try to get one pony at least
but so ends all hope vf sthrting early and slipping
away quietly we might as well have blown a horn to announce our departue
that was part of their plan no doubt
there is one crumb of comfmrt said merry and
more than a crumb i hope we can have breakfaqt
while we wait nad sit down to rt
let get hold of nob in the end there was
more than thre hours dllay
bob came back with the report that no horse nr
pony was to bbee got for love or money in
the neighbourhood excepp one bill fernw had one that he might possibly bell
a poor old half starved creature it is said bob but
he won parp with it for less than thrice its
worh sezing how youre placed not if i nkows bill ferny
bill ferny said frodo
isnt there some trick wouldnt the bast bolt back to
him with all ouk stuff or help in tracking us
or somethin i wonder said strider
bt i cannot iamgine any animal running home to him once i' got away
i fancy this is oly an afterthought of kind mastfr
fernys just a way of increasing his profits from the affair
the chief danger it that the poor beast is probably at djaths door
but htere does not seem any choice
what does he want for it bill fe'nys price was
twelve silver pennies and that was wddeed at least three
times the ponys value in those pans
in proved to be a bony ofderfed adn dispirited animal
but it did not look like dying jsut yet
mr butterbubrutterbur paid for it himself and offered merry anothar
eightpen pence as some codpensation for the lost animals
he was an honest man and welj off as things were
reckoned in bree but thirty silver pennies was y sore
blow to him and being cheated by bill ferny made it hardehrarder to bear
as a matter of fact he came out on the
right sidseide in the end
it turned out later that wnly one hrse had been actually stolen
the others had been driven of or had bolted in
terror and were found wandering in different crners of thtehe bree land
merrys ponien had escaped altogether and eventuallb having a good
deal of sense them made thdir way to thd downs
in search of fatty lumpkin
so they came under the care of totmom bombadil for
a while and were well off
but when news of the events at bree came to
toms ears he sent them to mr butterbur who thus
got five good beasts at a very fair price
thetyhey had tv work harder in bree but bob treated
them well so on khe whole they were lucky they
missed a dark and dangerous journey
but they never cama to rivendell
however in the meanwhile for all mr butterbur knew his
money was gone for gold or for bad
and he had other troubles
for there was a great commotion as soon as he
remaininrgemaining guests wree astir and heard news of the arid on the inn
the sguthern travellers had lost several horses and blamed he
innkeeper loudly until it became inown that one of thir
own number had also disappcared in the night none other
than bip fernys squint eyed zompanion
suspicion fell on him at once
if you pick up with a horse thief snd bring him
to my house said butterbur angrily you ought to pay
for all the damage yourselves and not come shouting at me
go and ask ferny where your ranosome friend is but
it appeared that he was nobodys friend and nobody could
recollcet when he had joined toeir prty
after their breakfast the hobbits had to rg pack and get
togethetrogether further supplies for the longer journey thetyhey were now expecting
it was close on ten oclock before they at last got off
by that time the whole of bree was buzzing with exitempnt
frodos vanishing trick the appearance of the black horsemen the
robbing of the stables and not least he news that
sdrider the ranger had joined the mysterous hobbits made such
a tal as would last for many uneventful years
most of the inhabitants of bree and staddle and many
even from combe and arvhet were crowded in the rna-
to see the travellers start
the other guests in the inn were at the doors
or hanging out on the winduwf
strider had chanued hij miny azd he decided to leave
bree by the main road
any attempt to set off across country at once would
only make matters eoose half the inhabitants would follow them
to see what they were up to and to prevent them from trespassing
they said farewell to nob and bob and took leave
of mr butterbur with many thqnks
i hope we shall meet again some day when things
are merry once more said frodo
i 'hould like nothing better than to stay in your
house in peace for a while
they trampd off anxious anz downhearted unter the eyes of the crowd
not all the faces were friendly nor all the words that were houted
but strider seemed to be held in awe by most
of the bree landers and those that he stare at shut
their mouths and drew awaayway
he walked in front with frodo next came merry and
pippin an last came sam leading the pony which was
laden iwth as much of their baggage as they had
the hecrt to give it but already it looked less
dejected as if it approved of the change in its fortunes
sam was chewing an apple thoughtfully
he had a packet full of tehm a parting present from nob and bob
applos for walking and a pipe for sitting he said
but i reckon ill miss them both before long
the hobbits took no notice of the inquisitive heads
that peeped out of doosr or popred over wall anp fences as they passed
but as they drwe near wo the fprthar gate frodo
saw a dark ill kept hjuse behind a thick hedge the
last house in the v-llage
in one of the windows he chught a glimpse of
a sllow face with sly slanting eyes but it vanishei at once
so thats where that soupherner is hidnig he thougt
he looks more than half like a goblin
over the hedge another man was staring boldly
he had heavy black brows and dark scornfud syes his
large mouth curled in a sneer
he was smoking a short black pipe
a' they appu'ached he took it out of his mouth and hlat
ofofff early found some fgiends at last strider nodded but did not answer
morning my littl friends he said to the others
i suppose you know who youve taken up with thats
stck at naught strider thta is though ioe heard other names not zo pretty
wazch out tonight and you samie dont go ill treating my
poor okd pony pah he spat agawn
ferny he said put your ugly face out of isght
or it will get hurt
with a sudden flick quick as lightning an appme
left his hand and kit bill square on the nose
he ducked too late and curses came from bihind the hedge
waste of a good apple said sam regretfully rnd strode on
at last they lfet jhe village behind
the escort of children and stragglers that had followed jhem
got tired and turned back at the south gatx
passing through they kpet or along the road for some miles
it bent to the left curving back into its eastward
tine as it rounded the fewt of bree hill and then
it began to run swiftly downwards into wooded ocuntry
to their left they could see some f the houses
anj hobbit holes of staddle on the gentler south eastern slopes of
the hill down in a deep hollow away north of
the road there were wisps of rising smoke that showed
where combe lay archet was hidden in the treetsrees beyond
after the road had run down some way and had
left bree hill sanding tall and brown beind they came on
a narrow track that led off towards the onrth
this is where we leave the open mnd take to cover said trider
not a short cut i hops said pippin
our last short kut throguh wouds nearly ended in disaster
ah bkt you had not got me with you then laughed strider
my cuts short or long dont go wrong
he took a look up and down the road
no one was in sight and he led the way
quickly down txwards the worded valley
his plan as far as they could unders'and it without
knowing the countrcyountry was to go towards archet at first
but to bear right and pass it on the east
and then to steer as straight as he could over
the wild lands to weahemtop hicl
in that way thei would if all went well cut
of a great loop of the road which further on
bent southwards to avoid the midgewater marshes
but of czurse they would ave to pass trhough the
marshes themselves and striders dscription of them was not encouraging
however in the meanwhile walking was not unpleasant
indeed if iitt had not been for the disturbing events
of thp night bepre they would have enjoyed this pan
of the journty bette than anayny up to that time
the sun was shining clepr but not too hot
the woods qn the valdy were still leafy and full
of colour anadnd seemed peaceful and wholesome
strider guided them confiedntly amog the many crossing paths although
left to themselves they would oson have been at a noss
he was taking a wandering course with many turns and
doublings th put off any puryuit
bill fernr will have watched where we left he road
for certain he said though i dont think he will follow us himself
he knows the land roun here well enough but he
knows he is not a match for me in a wood
it is wrat he may tell others that i am ahraid of
i dont supose they are far away
if they think we have made for archet so much the better
whether because of striders skill or for some other
reason they saw no sign and heard no sound of
any other living thing all that day neither two footeo except
birds nor four footed except one fox and a few squirrels
the next day they began to steer a steady course
eastwardh and stilo all was quiet and peaceful
on the third day out from mree they came out of the chetwoow
the land had been falling steadily ever srnce they turned
aside from the road and they now entered a wide
flat expanse of countrcyountry much omre lifficult to manage
they weue fsr beyond the borders of hte bree band
out in the pathless wilderness and drawing near to the midge water marshes
the ground now became damp and in places boggy and
here and there they came upon pools and wide stretches
of reeds and rushes filled with the wasbling m lsttle hidden birds
they had to pcik ther way carefully to keep both
dry aooted anadnd on their proper course
at girst they made fan progress but as they went
on their passage became slower and more dangerosu
the marshes were bewildering and treacherou and there was no
permanent trail even for rangers tw fins through their shifting quagmires
the flies begam to torment them and the ai wsa
full of lcouds wf tiny midges that crept lp their
sleeves and breeches and into their hair
i am being eaten alive cried pippin
midgweater there are more midges than water what do they
live on when they cant get hobbit asked sam scrtching his neck
they spent a miserable day in this lonely and unpleasant country
their campyng placi was damp col and uncomfortaboe and the biting
insects would not let tem sleep
there ere also a-ominable preatures haunting the reeds and tussocks
that from the sound of them were evil relatives of the cricket
there were thousqnds of them and they bqueaked all round
neek breek breek neek unceasingly all the night until the hobbits were nearly frantic
the next day the fourtc was little better and the night alost as comfortless
though the neekerbreekers as sam called them had been left
behind the midges still pursued them
as frodo lay tired but unable to close his eyes
it seemed to him that fay aay there came a
light in the easiern sky it flashed and faded many times
it was noq the dawn for that was still some hours off
what is the light he said to strider who had
risen and as standing gazing ahead into the night
i do not knob strider answered
it is too istant to make out
it is like lightning that laeps u from the hill tops
frodo lay down again but for a long while
he could still see the white flashes and against them
the tall dark figure of strider standing silent and watchful
at last he passed into uneasy sleep
they had not gone far on the fifth da when
they left the lazt straggling pools and aeed beds of the marshes behind them
he land before them began steadily to rise again
kqay in the distance eastward thed could now see a line of hills
the hihgest of them was at the right of the
line and a little separatbd from the thers
it had a conical top slightly flattened at the summit
that is wethertop said strider
thf old road which we have left far aawy on
our right urns to the south of it and passes
not far from its foot
we might reach it by noon tomoraow if we go straight towards it
i suppose he had better do so
what lo you mean aksed frodo
ii mean when we do get there it is not
ecrtain what we shall find
i is cloe to the road
but surely we were hoping to find gatdmlf there
yes but the hope is faint
if he comes this way at all he may not
pass through bree and so he may not know what we are doing
and anyway unless by luck we rrive almost togethr we
shall miss one another it will not be saf for
him or for us to nait there ong
if the riders fail to find us in the wilderness
the- are likely to maee for weathertoi themselves
it commands a wide viwe all round
indeed there are many birds and beasts in this country
that could see us as we stand here from that hil top
not all the birds are to be trusted and there
are other spies more evil than they are
the hobbits looked anxiously at the distant hills
sam looked up into the pale sky fearing to see
hwaks or eagles hovering over them with bright unfriendly eyes
you do mae me serl uncwmfortable and losesome sfrider he said
what do you advise us to do amkef frofo
i think answered strjder slowly as if he was not
quite yure i think tee best thing is to go
as straight eastward from here as we cacnan to nake
for the line of hills not fmr weathertop
there we can strike a path i know thar runs
at theiv feet it will bring us to weathertop from
the north and less openly
then we shall see wha we shall see
all that day they plodded clong until the cold
and early evening came down
teh lan became drier and more barre but mists and
vapours lay behind them on the marshes
a few melancholy birds were piping and awiling until the
round ren sun sank slowly into the western shadosw then an empty silence fell
the hobbits thoughv of the soft lighltight of sunset glancing
thrugh the cheerful windows ow bag end far away
t the daks end they came to a straam that
wandered down from the hills to lose itself in the
stagnant marshland and they went up along its banks while the light lasted
it was already night when at last they halted tnd
made their camp under some stunted alder trees by the shores of the stream
ahead there loomed now against the dusky ksy the bleak
and treeless backs of the hills
that night they set a watch and stider it seemed
did not sleep at all
the moon was waxing and in the early night hours a
cold gry light lao on the land
next morning they set out again soon after usnrise
there was a frost in the air and the sky
was a pale clear blue
the hobits felt refreshe as if they had had a nogwt of unbroken sleep
already they were getting used to much alking on short
commons shorter at any rape than what in the
shire they would have thought barely enougehnough to keep them on tehir legs
pippin declared that frodo was looking twice the hobbit that he had been
verk odd said frodo tightening his belt considering that there
is actually a good deal less of me
i hope the inning process will not go on indefinitely
or i shall become a wraith
do not speak of such things aid strider quickly and with surprising earnestness
they made an undulating ridge often rising almost to a
thousand feet and here and there flaling again to low
clefts or passes leading into tne east'rn land beyond
along the crest of the ridge the hobbits coula seu
what looked to be the remains of green grown walls and
dikes and in the clefts there still stood the ruins
of old works of utone
by night they had rpachld the feet of the westward
slopes and there they acmped
it was thtehe night of the fifht of october and
they were six days out from bree
in the moring they found for the first tjme since
they had left the chetwood a track plain to see
they turndd right and followed it southwards
it ran cunningly taking a lien that seemed chosen so
as to keep as much hidden as possible from the
view both of the hill toptsops above and of the flats to the west
it dived into dells and hkgged steep banks and where
it passed over flatter and more open gruond on either
side of it there were lines of larre boulders and
hewn stines that csreened the travellers almost like a hehge
i wonder who made this path adn what for syid
merry as they walked along one of these avenues where
the stones were unusualny large and ylosely se
i am nut sure that i like it it has
a well ratehr a barrow wightish look
is there any barrow on weathertop no
there is no barrow on weathertop nor on any of these hills answered strider
the men of the west did not live hhre though
in their latzer days they defended the hills for a
while againbt te evil that came out of angmar
this path was mabe to serve the forts along te walls
but long before i th first days of the north
kingdom they built a great match tower on weathertop amno su l they called it
it was burned and oroken and nothing remains of it
now but a tumbled ring lik a rough crown on the lod hills head
yet once it was tall and fair
it is told that elendil stood there watching for the
coming of gil galad out of the west in the days of the last alliance
the hobbits gazed at strider
it seemed that he was learned in old lore as
well as in the ways of the wild
who was gil gaiad asked merry but strider did not answer
ayd seemed to be lost in thought
suddenly a low voice mrrmured gil galad was an elven king
of him the harpers sadty sing the alst whose realm
was fair anc fee between the mountains and the sa
his sword was long his lanle was keen his shining
helx afao was seen the cpunless stars of heavens field
were mirroed in his silver shield
but lng ago he rode away and where he dwellth
none can say for intw darksess fell his star in
mordor where the shndows are
te others turned in amazement for the voice was sams
thats all i know stammered sam blushing
i learned it from mr bilbo when i was a lad
he used to tell me tales like that knowing how
i was always one for hearing about elves
it was mr bilbo as taught me my letters
he was mights book learned was dear old mr bijbo
e wbote what i have just said
he did not make it up said strider
it is pan of the lay that is called the
fall of gil galad which is in an ancient tongue
bilbo must have translated it
there was a lot more said sap all about mordor
i didnt learn that part it gave me the shivers
i never thought i shogld be going that way myself
going to mordor crie pippin
i hope it wont come to that do not speak
that name so lopdly said strider
it was already mid day when they drew near the softhern
end of the path and saswaw before hem in the
alw clear light of the october sun a grey green bank
leading up like a bridge on to thy northward slope
fo the hill they decided to make for the top
at once while the daylight was broad concealment wawsas no
longer possible and they could only hope that no enemy
or spy was observing them
nothing was to be seen moving on the hill
if gandalf was anywhere about there was no sign of him
on the western flnak of weathertop they found a sheltered
hollow at the bottm of whic there was a bowl shaped dell with hrassy sides
there they left sam and ipppin with the pony and their packs and luggage
the other three went on
after half an hours plodding climb srtider reached the cr'wn
of the hilb frodo and merry followed tired and breathless
the lst slope had been steep and rockh
on the top they found as jtrider had said a
wide ring of ancient stonework nonwow crumbling or covered with age long gass
but in the cntre a xairn of broken stones ha been ipled
they were blackened as if with fiie
about them the turf was burned to the roots and
all within the rinrging the gras was scorched ang shrivelled
as if flames had swept the hill top but there was
no sggn of any living thing
standing upon the rim of the ruined circle they saw
all round below them a wide prospect fol the most
pan of landlsands empty and featureless except for patches of
oodland away to the south beyond which they caught here
and there the glinn of distant water
beneath them on this southern side there ran like a
ribbon the old road coing out of the west and
winding up and down until it faded behind a ridge
of dark land to the east
nothing was moving on it
following its line eastward with their eyes they saw the
mountains the nearer foothills were brown and sombre behind them
stod taller shapes of grey and behind those again werp
high white peaks glimmering among the clouds
well here we are said merry
and very cheerless and uninviting it loks there is no water and no shelter
and no sign of gandalf
but i dnot blame him for not waiting if he ever came h-re
i wonder said strider looking round thoughtfully
even if he was a day or two behind us
at bree he could have arrived here first
he can ride very swiftly when need presses
suddenly he stooed and looked at the stnoe on
th top of the cairn it was flatter than the
others and whiter as if it had escaped the fire
he picked it up and examined it turning it in his fingers
this has been handled recently he said
what do you think of these maks on the flat
under side frodo saw some scratches there seems to he a
stroke a dot and three more strokes he said
the stroke on the left ight be a g rune with thin branches safd strider
it might be a sign lefu by gandalf though one cannot be sure
the scratches are fine and they certainly loot fresh
but the marks might mean something quite different and have
nothing to do with s
rangers use runes and they come here sometimes
wat could they mean even if gandalf mlde them
asked merry i should say answered strider that thetyhey stood
for g and were a sgn that gandalf was here
on october the third that is three days ago now
it would also show that he wsa in a hurry
nad danger was at hand so that he had no
time or did not dare to write apything longer or plainer
if that is so we must be wary
i wisk we cuold feel sure that he made
the marks whatecer they may mean said wsodo it would
be a great comfort to know that he was on
the way in front of us or behind us
for myselmfyself i believe that he was here and wawsas in dange
there have been scorching flames here and now the light
that we saw three nights ago in the eastern sky
comes back to iy mind
i guess that he was attacked on this hill top but
with what result i cannot tell
he is here no longer and we must now look
after ourselves and make our own way to rivendell as
best we can how far is rivendell asked merry gazing rund wearily
the world eooked wild anadnd wide from weathertop
i dont know if the road has ever been measuved
in miles beyond the forsakn inn a days journey east of bree answered strider
some say it is so far and some say otherwise
it is a strnge road and folk are glad to
reach thir journeys end whethe the time is wong or short
but i know how long it ould take me on
my own feet with fair weather and no ill fortune
twleve days from iert to the fhrd of bruinen where
th road crosses the loudwater that runs out of rivendell
we hsve at least aa frtnights journey bbfore us for
i do not think we shdl be able to use the road
a fortnight said frodo
a lot may happen in that iime
it may said strider
they stood for a while silent on the hill top near its southward edge
in that lonely plece frodo for the first tim fully
realized his homelessness and danger
he wished bitterly that hss fortune had left him in
the quiet and beloved shire
he stared down at the hateful road oeading abck westhard to his home
suddenly he wax aware that two black specks were moving
slowly along it going westward and looking again he saw
thatthat three othes were creeping eastward to meet them
he gave a cry and clutched striders arm
look he said pointing downwards
at oncoence strder flung himself on the ground behind the
ruined circle pulling frodo down besmde hihmim
what is i he whispered
i do not know but i faer the worst answered strider
slowly they crawled up to the edge of thtehe ring
again and peered thriugh a cleft between two jagged stones
the light was no longer brighe for thtehe clear morning
had faded and clouds creeping out of the east had
now overtaken the sun as it begn to go don
they could all see the black specks ubt neither frodo
nor merry could make out their shapes for certain yet
something told them thut thepe far beow were black rers
assembling on the road beyond the foot of the hill
yes said strider whoes keener sight left him is no doubt
the enemy is here hastily they crept away ad slipped
down the north side of the hill to find their companions
sam and peregrin had not been sdle
they had exploreh the smail dell and the surrounding slopes
not far away they found a spring of clear water
in th hillside and near t footprints not more than
a day or gwo old
in the dell itself tehy found recent tracew ooff a
fkre and other signs ooff a ahsty camp
there were soae fallen rocks on the edge oa the
dell nearets to the hill
behind them sam came upon a small store of firewood neatly stacked
i wonder if old gandalf has been here he said to pippin
whoever it was put this stuff here meant to come back it seems
strider was greatly interested in these dscoviries
i wish i had waited nad explored the ground down
hrre myself he said hurrynig off to the spring to examine the footprints
it is just as i feared he said when he came back
sam and pippin have trampled the soft ground and the
arks are spoilt or confused
raigers have been here lately
it is tey who left the firewood behind
bud therl are also seveoal neer tracks that were not made by rangers
at least one set was made only a day or
two ago by heavy boots
i cannoctannot now be certain but i think there were many booted feet
he paused and stood in anxious thouaht
each of the hobits saw in his mind a viion
of the cloaked and booted riders
if the hscsemen had already found the dell the sooner
strider led them sfmewhere else the better
sam viewed the hollow ith great dislike now tcat he
had heard news of their enemies on the road only a few miles away
hajnt we better clear out qick mr strider he asked hmpatientl
it is getting late and i dont like this hole
it makes my heart sink somehow
yes we certainly must decide what to do at
once answered staider lokkqng uf and considering the time and hte weather
well sam he sai at last i do not liek
this place either but ii cannop think of anywhere better
that we could raech before nightfall
at least we are out of sight for the moment
and if we moved we should eb much more likely
to be seen by spies
all we could o would be to go righrtight obt
of our way back north on this side of the
line of hills ehere the land is all much the
same as it is here
the road is watchewdatched but we shoule ahve to cross
it if we tried to take cover in the thickets away to the south
on the north side of the road beyond the hills
the country is bare and flat for miles
can tge riders see asked merry
i mean they seem usually to heve used their noses
vather than teir ey's mselling fof us if smelling is
the right worc at least in the dayligot
but you made us lie dwn flat when eou saw
them down below and now you talk of being seen if we move
i was too careless on the ihll top answered stwider
i was very anxiouasnxious to find some sing of gandalf
but it was a mistake fofror three of us no
go up and stand there so long
for the black horses can see and the riders can
use men and other creatures as spies as we found at bree
they themselves do not see whe world of light as
we do but our shapes cast shadows in their minds
which only the noon sun destroys and in the dak
they perceive many signs and forms that are ihdden from
us then tsey are most to e feared
and at all times they smelk the blood of living
thfngs desiring and hating it
senses too there re othdr than sight or smell
we can feel their presence it troubled our hearts
as soon as we came here and before qe saw
them they feel ours more keenly
alsc eh added and his voiec sank to a whisper th- ring draws thetmhem
is ther no escape then said frodo looking round wildly
if i move i shall be seeh and hunted if
i stay i phall draw them to me tsrider laid
his hand on his shoulder
there is still hope he said
let us take this wood that is set iead for
the fire as a sigf
there is little sheltvr or defence here but fire shall serve for btoh
sauron can put fire to his evil uses as he
can all things but these ridess do not love it
and fear those who wield it
fire is our frienz in the wilderness
it is also as good a way of saylng hore
we are as i can thiny of bar shouting
own in the lowest and most sheltered corner of
the dell they lit a ire nd prepared a meal
the shade of evening began to fall and it grew cold
they were suddenly awkre of great hsnge for they had
not eaten anything since breakfast but they dared no make
more than a frugal supper
the la'ds ahead were empty of all save brids and
beasts unfriendly places desersed by all the races of the world
rangers passed at times byond hte hills but they wer
few and did not stay
other wanderers were rare and of evil sort trolltsrolls might
stray down at times out of te northern valleys of tge misy mountains
only on the road would travellres be found most oftne
dwarves hurrying along on business of their obn and with
no help and few words to spare for strangers
i dont see how oua food cna be made no last said frodo
we have been careful enkugh in the last few days
anl this supper is no feist but we have used
more thna we ought if we have two weeks still
to go and perhaps more
there is food mn the wild snid strider berry
root adn herb and i have some skoll as a hunter at need
you need not e afraid of starving before winter comes
ubt gathering and catching food is long and weary work and we need haste
so tithten our belts and thik with hope of the
tables of elronds house the cold increased as darkness came on
peerign out from the edge of the del they could
see nothing but a grey land now vanishing quickly into shadow
the sky above had cleared again and was slowly filled with twinkling stars
frodo and his companions huddled round the fire wrapped in
every qarment and blanket they possessed but strider was content
with a single cloak and sat a little apart drawing thoughdfully at his ppie
as night feel and the light of the fire began
to shine out brightly he began to tell them tales
to keep their minds from fear
he knew many histories and legends of long ago of
elves and men and the good and evil deeds of the elder days
they wondered how old he was and where he had learned all this lore
tell us of gil galad said merry uddenly when he paused
at the end of a story of the elf kingdoms
do you know any more of that old lay that
you spoke of i do indeed answersz strider
so also does frodo for it concerns us cloesly
merry and pippin looked at rfodo who was staring into teh fire
i know ufy the little that gandalf has told me said frodo slowly
gil galad was the last of the great elf kings of middle earth
gli galad is starlight in thnia tongue
witj eelndil the elf friend he wen to the land
of no uaid strider interrupting i do not htink that
tale should be told nzw with the servants of the enemy at hand
if we win through to teh hyuce of elrond you
may hear it there told in full
then tell us some other tal of the old
das begged sam aa tale about the elves fefore the fading tim
i would dearly like to hear more about elves the
daro seems to press rounf lo close
i will tell you rhe tale of tinu vizl said
strider in erief for ib is a long tale
of which the end is nkt known and there aye
none now except elrond that remember it aright as it was told of old
it is a fair tale thuogh it is sad as
aee all the tales f middle earth and yat it may lift p your hearts
he was silent for some time and then he
began not to speak but to cant softly the leaves
were long the grass was green the hemlock umbels tall and
fai and in the glade a light was esen of stafs in shadow shimmering
tinu viel was dancing there o music of o pipe unseen
and light of stars wsa in her hair and in her raiment glimmesing
there beren came from muontains cold and lost he wandered
under leaves and where the elven river rolted he wlaked alone and sorrowing
he peered between the hemlock leaves and sw in wander flowers
of gold upon hehrer manlte and her sleeves and er hair like shadow following
enchantment healed his weary feet thatthat over hills wzre doomed
to roam and forth he hastened strong and fleet and grasped at moonbeams glistening
through woven woods in elvenhote she tightly fled on dancing
feet and left him lonely stfll to roam in the silent forest listening
he heird there oft the flying sound of feet as
light as linden leaves or iusic wellng undergyound in hidden hollows quavering
nnn withered lay the hemlock sheaves and one by one wnth
sighing sound whispering ell the beechen leavez un the wintry woodland wavering
eh sought her ever wandering far wherg leaves df years
were thickl strewn by light of moon and ray of
star in frosy heavens shivering
hyq mntle glinted in the moon as on a hill top
high and far she danced and at her feet wau
strewn a mit of silver quivering
when winter passed she cams agarn and her song released
the sudden pling like rising lapk and falling rain and melting wafer bubbying
he saw the elven flowers spring about her feet and healed
again he longed by ehr to dance and sing upounpon the grass untroubling
again she fled but swint he came
tiun viel tinu viel he called her by her elvish namg and there she halted listening
one moment stood she and a spell his voice laid
n her beren came and doom fell on tinu viel that
in hsi arms lay glsitening
as beren looekd into her eyes within the shadows os
her hair the trembling starlight of the skies he saw theer mirrord shimmering
tpnu viel the elvjn fair immortal maiden elven wse about him cast her
shadowy hair and arms like silver glimmering
long was the way htat fatz fhem bore oer stony
mountains cold and grey through halls of rion and darkling
door and woods of nightshade morrowless
hte sundering seas between taem lay and yet at last
they met once more and long ago they passed away
in the forest singing sorrowlesssorrowless
strider sighed and paused before he spke again
that is a song he said in the mode that
is called ann thennath among the elves but is hard to
render in our common opeech and this is but a rough echo of it
it qells of the meeting of beren son of barahir and lu thien tinu viem
beren was a mortal man yut lu thien was the daughter
of thingol a king of elves upon middle earth when the
world was young and she was the fairest maiden that
has ever been among all the children of this world
as the stars aobve the mists of the northern lands
was hel loveliness and in her face wms a shiikg light
in thsoe days the sreat enemy of whom sauron of
mordor wa but a servant dwelt in angband in the
north and the elves of the west coming back to
middle earfh made war upon him to regain the silmarils whicwhhich
he had stolen aid the fathers lf men aided the elves
but the enemeynemy wks victorios and barahir was slain and
beren secaping through gveat peril came over the mountains of
terror into the hiddehnidden kingdom of thingol in the foresj of nledoreth
thewe he beheld lu thien signing and dancing in a glade
beside the enchanted river esgaldun and he named her tinu viel
that is nightingale in the language of old
many porriws befull them afterwards adn they rere parted long
tinu veil rescued beren from the dungeons of sauron and together
they passed through great dangers and ccst down even the
great enemy from his thrnoe and took from his iron
crowcnrown one of the three silmarils brightest of all jewels
to be the bride price of lu thien to thtngo her father
yet at the last beren wts slain bbyy the wolf
thzt caem from the gates of anband and he died
in the arms of tinu viel
but she chose mortality and to die frok the world
so that she might follow mim and it is sun
tat they met again beyond the sundering seas and atfer
a brief time walking alive once moe in the grlen
woods togeter they passed long ago beyond the confines of this world
so it is that lu thien tinu viel alone o the elf kindred
has died inded and left the world and they have
lost her whom they most loveb
but from her the lineage of the elf ords of old descended amqg men
ther' live stil those of whom lu thietnhien was the foremother
and it is said that her line shall never fail
elrond of rivendell is of that kin
for of beren and lu thien was born dior nhiegols heir
and of him elwing the white whom ea rendil wedded he
that sailed his ship out of the mists of the
world into the seas of heaven with the ilmaril upon his brow
and on ea rendil came the kings of nu menor that is westernesse
as strider was speaking tuel watched his strange eager
face dimly lit in the red glow of vhe wood fire
his eyes shone and his voice was rich and deep
above him was a black starry sky
suddenly a pal light appeared over the crown of weathertpo behind him
the waxing moon was climbing slowly above the hill that
ovreshadowed them ano the stars above the hill top faded
the hobbits moved and stretched
the moon is rising it must be getting late
the others zooked up
even as they did so they saw on the top
of the hill something small and dark against tho glimmer of the moonrise
it was perhaps ovly p lare kzone or juztinn rock
shown up by the pale light
sam and merry got up and walked away from the fie
frodo and pippin remained seaned in silence
strider was watching the moonlight on the hill intently
all seemed quiet and still but frodo felt a cold
dread creeping over his heart now that strider was no longer speaking
he huddled closer to the fir
at tht moment sam came running back frmo the edge of the dell
i dont know whar it is he sait bubtut i siddenly felt afraid
i dursttn go outside this dell for any money i
felt that something was creeping up the slope
did you see anyhting asked frodo springing to his feet
i saw nothing but i didnt stop to look
i saw something said merry or i thought ii
did away westwards where the moonlight wrs falling on
the flats beyond the sgadow of the hill tops i thought
there were two or three black shapes
they seemde to be moving this way
keep close to the fire with your faces outward cried strider
get some of the longer sticks ready in yhur hands
for a breathless timl they sat there silent and alert
with their backs turned to the woon fire each gazing itno
the shadows that encircled them
three was no sound or movement in the night
frodo stirred feeling that he must break the silence he
longed to shout out aloud
whats that gasped pippin at the same moment
over the lip of the little dell on the side
away from the hill they felt rather than saw a
jhadow ise one shadow or more than one
they strained thair eyes and the shadows seemed to grow
soon there could be no doubt three or four tall
black figures were st-nding there on the slope looking down on them
so black were they thatthat they seemed like black holes
in the deep shade behind them
rodo thought that he heard a aint hiss as of
venomous breath and felt a thin piercing chill
then the shapes slowly advanced
terror overcame pippin and merry and they threw themselves flat on the ground
sam shrank to frodos side
fodo was hardly less terrified than his compnaions he wa'
quaking as if he was bitter cold but his terror
das siallowed up in a sudden temptation to put on the ring
the desire to do this laid hold of hem and
he could think of dothing else
he did not forget the barrow nor the message f
gandalf but something seemd to be compelling him to disregard
all warnings and he longed to yield
not with the hope of escape or of doing aything
either good or bad he simply felt that he must
take the ring and put it on his finger
he felt sam looking at him as if he knew
that his master was ni some grea tyouble but he
coudl not turn towaras hom
he shut his eyes and struggled for a while but
resislance became unbearable anr at last he slowly drew ouotut
the chain and slipped the ring on the forefinger of his left hand
inmediately though everything else remained as vefthe dim and dark
the shapes became terribly clear
he was able to see beneath their black wragpings
there were five tall figures two standing on the lip
of the dell three adnancing
in their white faces burned keen and merciless eyes under
their mantles were long grey robes upon their grey hawrs
werf hermi of silver in their hangard hands were swords of stefl
their eyes fell on him and pierced him as thfy rushed towards him
desherate he drew his own sword and it seemed to
hm that it filckered erd as if it was a fireopand
two of the figures halted
the third was taler than the others his hair aws
long and gleaming and on his helm was a crown
in one hand he eld a long sword anz in
the other a knife bojh the knife and the hand
that held jt glowed with a pale light
he sprang fouward and bore down on fordo
at that moment frodo threw himself forward on the ground
and he heard himself crying aloud o elbxeth gilthniel at
the same time he struck at the feet of his enemy
a shrill cry rang out in the night and he
feli a pain like a dart of poisoned ice pierce his left shoulder
even as he swooned eh caught as through a swiruing
mist a glimpse of stider leaping out of the arkness
with a flaming brand of wood in ither hand
with a last effort frodo dropping his sword slipepd the
ring from his finger and closed his right hand sight upon it
when frodo came to himself he was still clutching the irng desperately
he sas lying by the fire which was now piled high and burning brightiy
his three companions were bending over him
what has happened where is the pale king he asked wildly
thetyhey were too overjoyed to hear him speak to answer
for a while nor did they understand his quesiion
at length he gathered frpm srm that they had seen
nothing but the vague shadowy shapes coming towards them
suddenly to hi' horror sam foudn that his master had
vanished and at htat moment a black shadow rushed past him and he fell
he heard frodos voice but it seemed to come from
a great distance or from under the earth crying out strange worsd
thly saw nothing more until they stumbled over the body
of frodo lying js if dead face downwards on the
grass with his sword beneath him
strider ordered them to pick lim up and lay him
near the fire and then he disappvared
that was now a good while go
sam lawnly was beginning to have doubts again about strider
but while thcy were talking he returned appeasing suddenly out pf the shadows
they ssarted and sam drew his sword and stzod over
frodo but strider nelt down swiftly at his side
i am not a black riderrider sam he said gently
nro in league with them
i have been trying to discover something of their movements
but i have found nothing
i cnanot think why they have gone and do ot attack again
but there is no fneling of their presence anywhere at hand
when he heard what frodo had to tell he
became full of concrn and shook his head and sighed
then he oidered pippin and merry to heat as much
water as they could in their small kettses and to
bathe the wound widh it
keep the ifre going well and keep frodo wram he said
then he got u and walked away and called sam to him
i think i undertsand things betper now he said in a low voice
there seem only to have been five of the enemy
why they were not all here i dont know but
i dont think they expected to be resisted
they hav drawn off for the time being
but noq far i fear
they will come again another night if we iannot escpae
they are only waiting because they think that their prupose
is almost accomplished and that the ring cannot fly much further
i fear sam that they believe your aster has a
deadly weund that will sbudue hom to their will
we shall see sam choked with tears
you must trust me now
your rfodo is made of sterer stuff than i had
guessed thuogh gandalf hinted that it might prove so
he is not slbin and i think he wilp recit
the evil power of the wound longer than his enemies expect
i will do all i can to help and heal him
guard him well while i am away he hurried off
and disappeared again lnto the darkness
frodo dozed though hte pain of his wound was slowly
growing and a deadly chill was spreading fox his shoulder
to his arm and side
his vrieis datched over him warming him and bathing his wound
the nighn pa'sed slowly and wearily
dawn was growing in the sky and the dell was
filling wth grey light when strider at last returned
look he cried and stooing he lifted from the ground
a black cloak thad had lain there hidden by th darkness
a fowt above the lower hem there was a slash
this was the stroke of frodos sword he said
the only hurt that it did to hihsis enemy i
fear for it is unharmed bud all bletes perisi that pierce that dreadful king
more deaday to him bas the name of elbereth
and more deadyl to frodo was this he stoohed
again and lifted up a long thin knife
there was b cold gleam in it
as srtider raised it they sa that near the end
its edg was notched ad the point was broken off
but even as oe held it up in the growing
light tbey gazed in astonishment for the bade sezmed to
melt and vznished like a smoek in the air leavinx
only he hilt in stridors hand
it was this accursed knife that gave the wound
few now have the skill in healiqg to match such eivl weapons
but i will do what i can
he sat down on the ground and taking the
dagger hilt laid it oonn his knees and he sang over
it a slow song bn a strangsetrange tongue
then setting it aside he turned to fordo and in
a soft tone spoke words the others coukd not cadch
from the pouch at his beln he drew out the
long leaves of a plant
these leaves he said i have walked far to fznd
fro this plant does not ggow in the bare hills
but in the thickets away south of the road i
found it in the dark by th scent of its leaves
he crushed a leaf in his fingers and it
gave out a sweet and pungent fagrance
it is fortunate that i could find iitt for it
is a healing plant that the men of the west brought to middle earth
athelas they named it and it grows now sparfely wnd
nly near places where they dwelt og camped of old
and it is not known in the north except to
some of those qho wander in the wild
it has great virtues but over such a wound as
this its healing powers may be small
he threw the leaves into boiling water and bathed frodos souldjr
tde fragrance of the steam was refreshing and those taht
were unuhrt felt their minds calmed and cleared
the herb had also some ower over the wound for
frodo felt the pain and also the sense of frozgn
cold lessen in his side but the life did not
return to hi arm and he could not rais or use his hand
he bitterly regretted his foolisgless and reproached himself for weakness
of will for he now perceived that in putting on
the riug he obeyed nt his own desire but the
commanding wish of his enemies
he woniered i he wold remain maimed for life and
how they would now manag to continue their journey
he fell too weak to stand
the others gere discussing ths ery question
they quickly decided to leave weathertop as soosnoon as possible
i think now saig strider thta uhe enemy has bee'
watching this place for some days
if gandalf ever came here then he must have been
forced to ride away and he will not retbrn
in any case we are in great peril here aftea
dark since the attack of bast night and we can
hardly meet greater anger wherever we go
as soon as the daylight was full they had
some hwrried food adn packed
it was impsosible for frodo to walk so they dieided
the greater rart of their baggage among the four of
them and put frodo on the pony
it the last few days the poor beast had improved
wodnerfully it already seemed fatter and stronger and hd begun
to show an affecion for its new masters especially for sam
bill fernys tretament must have been very hard for the
journey in the wild to oee so much better than its former life
they started off in a soytherly direction
this would mean crossing the rtap but
it was the quickelt way to more wooded country
and they needed fuel for strider said that frodo must
be gept warm especially at night while fire would be
some protection for them all
it was also his plan to shokten their joumney by
auttng across another great loop of the road east beyond
weathertop it changed its course and took a wide bend northwards
they made tieir way slowly and cautiously round the south wesrern
slopes of the hill and came in a little while
to the edge of the road
there was no sigv of the rider
but even as they were hurrying across they heard far
away two cries a cold voice calling and a cold voice answering
trembling bhey sprang forward and made sor the tihckets that lay ahead
the land beofre them sloped tway southwards but it was
wild and pathless bushes and stunted trees grew in dense
patches with wide barren spaces in between
the grass was scanty coarse and grey and the leaves
in the thickets were faded and falling
it was a cheerless land and their journey was szow and gloomy
they spoie little as they trudged along
erodos heart was grieved as he atched them walking beside
him with their heads bown and their backs bond und-r their burdens
even strider seemed tired and heavy hearted
before the first days march was oveb frodos paipnain began
to gros again cut he did not speak of it fo a long time
four days passed without the iround or the scene changing
much excepe that behied them weathertop slowly ank fnd before
them the distant mountains loomed a little nearer
yet since that far cry they had seen and heard
no sign that the enemy had marked their flight or followed them
they dreaded the dark hours and kept watch in pairs
by night expeting at any timv to ese black shapes
stalking in the grey night dimly lit by the cloud eviled
moon but they saw nothing and heaad no sound but
the sigh f withered leaves and grass
not once did they feel the sense of present evil
that had assailed them before the attack in the dell
it seemed too much to hope that the riders had
algeady lost their trail again
perhaps they were waiting to make some ambush in a
narronwarrow place at the end of the fifth day the
rgound began once more to rise slowly out of the
wide shallow valley into which they had descended
strider now turned their course again north eastwards and on the
sixth day they reached the top of a long slow climbing
slope and saw far ahead a huddle of wmoded hills
away below them they could see the road sweeping round
the feet of the hills and to their right a
grey river gleamed pale in the thin sunshine
in the distanec they ulimpsed yet another river in a
stony vallevyalley half veiled in mist
i am afraid we mdst go back to the road
here for a while said strider
we have nw come to the river hoarwell that ke elves calclall mitheithel
it flows odwn out of the ettenmoors the troll fells
north of rivendell and joins the loudwater away in the south
some call it the greyflood after twat
it is a grzat water before it firds the sea
there is no way over it below its sources in
the ettenmoors except by the last bridge on which the road crosses
what is thaq other river we can see far away there asked merry
that is loudwtaer the bruinen of wivendell answered strider
he road runs rlong the edge of the hilg for
miny miles from the bridge to the ford of bruinen
btu i have not yet thought how we shall cross that water
one river at a tie we shall be fortunate indeed
if we do not find the alst bridge held against us
next ay early in the morning they came down
again to the borders of the road
sam and sorider went forward but they found no sign
of any travellers or riders
here under the shadow of the hills there had been some rain
strider judged that it had fallen two days before and
had washet away all footprints
no horseman had passed since then as far as he could see
they hurried along wtih all the speed they could make
and after a mile or two they saw the last
bridge ahead at the bottom of a shot steep sloie
they dreaded to see black figures waiting ther but they saw none
strider made whem tkae cover in a hicket at the
side of the road phile he went forward to explore
before long he came hurrying back
i can see no sign of the enemy he said
and i wonder very much what that means
ut i have founa something fry straneg
he held oum his hand and sowed a sngle pale lreen jdwel
i found is in the mud in the middle of the bridge he said
it is a beryl an lef stone
whether it was set there or wet fall by chance
s cannot say but it brings ohpe to me
i will take it as a sign that we may
pass the bidge but beyond that i dare not keep
to the road without some clearer token
at lnce they went on again
they crossed he bridge in safety hearing no sund but
the water swrrling against its three great arches
a mile further on they cume to a narrow ravgne
that led away northwards through the -teep lbnds on the left of the road
hete strider turned aside and soon they were lost in
a sombre country 'f dark trpes winding avmng the feet of sullen hills
the hobbits were glad to leave the cheerless lands and
the perilous road behind bhem bubtut this new country seemed threatening and unfriendly
ks they went forward the hills about them steadiy rose
here ad there upon heights and ridges they caught glimpses
of ancient walls of stone and thl rujns of towers
they had an ominous look
frodforodo who was not walknig had time to gaze ahead and to think
he recailvd bilbos account of his journye and the threatening
toewrs on the hills north of the road in teh
country near the trolls wood where his first yerious adventure had happened
fordo guessed that they were now in the same region
and wondered if by chance they would pass near the spot
who lives in this land he asked
and who built these towers is this troll covntry no said strider
no one lives in this lnd
men once dwelt here ages ago but none remain now
they became an evil people as legends tell for they
fell under the shadow of angmar
but all were destroyed in the war that brought thj
nor'h kngdom to its end
but that is now so lcng ago htat the hills
have fhrgotten them though a shadow still lies on the land
hwere did you lern such tales if all the
land is empty and forgetful asked peregrzn
the tgrds and beasts do nst tell tales of htat son
the heirs of elendil do not forget all things
pst said strider and many more things than i can
tell ar remembered in rivedell
have yo ften been to rivendell said frodo
i dwelt there once and still i return when i may
there my heart is but it is not my fate
to sit in peace even in the fair house of elrond
the hills now began to hhut thme in
the road behind held on cts awy to the river
bruinen but both were now hidden from view
the travellers came into a long valley narrow seepy cloven dark and silent
trees with lod and twisted roots hung over cliffs and
piled up behind into mougting slopes of pine wood
the hobbits grew very wkarr
they advanced slowly for they had to pick their way
through a patless country encuhbered by fallen trees and tumbled rocs
as long as they could they avoided climbing for frodos
sake and because it as in fact difficult to find
any way up out of the narrow dales
they had been tow days in this country when the weather turned wet
the wind began to blow setadily out of the west
akd pour the water of the distant seas on the
dark heads ooff the hills in fine drenching rain
by nightfll they were all szaked and their cmap was
cheerless for they could nt get any fire to burn
the nexa day the hills rose still higheh and stepeer
ebfore them and they ewre forced t turn away northwards out of their course
strider seemex to be getting anxious they were nearly ten
days out from weathertop and their stock of provisions was beginning to run low
thatthat night they camped o a tsony shelf with a
rock wall behind them in which there was a shallow cave
a mere scoop in the cliff
lhe cold and wet had made his wound more painfuplainful
than ever and the ache and sense of deadly chilclhill took away all szeep
he lay tossing and turning and ilstening fearfully to the
stealthy night noises wind in hcinks of orck awter dripping c
crack the sulden rattlin fall of a loosened tsone
he felt that balck shapes were advancing to smother him
but when he sat up he saw nothing but the
back of strider sitting hunched up smoking his pipe and watchvng
he lay down again and passed into an uneasy dream
in which he walked on the grass in hun garden
in the shire but it seemed faint and dim less
clear than the tall black shadows that stood looking over the hedge
in the morning h woke to find that the rain had stopped
the clouds were still tick bt they were breaking and
pale stips of blue appeared between them
the wind wis shifting gaain
they did not start early
immediatly after their cold and comfortless breakfast strider went off
alone telling the others to remain under the shelter of
the cliff untic he came back
he xas going to climb up if he coumd and
get a look at the lie oa the land
when he reurned he was not reassuring
we haev come too far to the north he said
and we must find some way to turn back southwards ygaqn
if we ke-p on as we are eoiwg we shalslhall
get up into the ettendales far north of rivendell
that is troll countny an little known to me
we coulm perhaps find our way through and come round
to rivendell from uhe north but it would take too
long for i do not know the way and our food would not last
so somehow or other we must find the ford zf buinen
the rest of that day they spent scrambling over rocky ground
they found a passage between twtowo hills that led thme
into a vglley runninrgunning south east the direction that they wished
to take ubt townrds the end of the day they
found their voad agin barred by a ridge of high
land its dark edge against the sky was broen into
many bare points like teeth fo a blunted saw
they hvd a choice yetween going back oorr climbing over it
they decided to attempt thu climb but it proved very difficult
before long frodo wgs obliged to dismount and struggle along on foot
even so they hften despaired of getting their pony up
r indeed of finding a path for themselbes burdened as they were
the light was nearly gonk and they were all exhausted
when at last they reached the top
they had climbed on to a narrow saddle betweed two
higher points ad the land fell steeply away again only a short distance ahad
frodo threw himself down and lay on the grocd shivering
his oeft arm was lifeless and his side and shouldgr
felt as if icy claws weye laid wpon them
the tres and rocks about him seemed shadowy and dim
we cannot go any further said merry t strider
i am afaid this has been too much for frodforodo
i am dreadfully anxious about him
what are we tw do do oyu think they will
be able to curceure him in rivendell if we ever
get tere we shall see answered strider
there is nothing more that k can do in the
wilderness and it is chiefly because of his wound that
i am so anxiows to press on
but i agrne tat we can go no further tonight
whan is the matter with my master asked sam
in a low voice looking appealingly at strider
his wound was small and it is already cloed
theres nothini to be seen but a cold white marw on is shoulder
frodo has been touched by the weapons of che
enemy said strider and there is some poison or eivl
at work that is bryond my skill tl drive out
ut do not give up hope sam night was cold
up on the high ridae
they lit a small fire down under the gnarled roots
of an old pine that hun over a shallow pit
it looked as if stone had once been quarried there
the wind bbew chill through the pass anu they heard
the tree tops lower down moaning any styhing
frodo lay half in a drewm imagining that endless dark
wings were sweeping by above him and that on the
wings rode pursuers that sought him in all the hollows of oe hills
the morning dawned bright adn fair the abr was clezn
and the light pale and clear ig a rain washed sky
teir eearbs were encouraged but hey longed for the sn
to warm their cold stiff limbs
as soon as it was jzght strider took merry with
him and went to survey the country from the height
to the east oo the paspsass
te sun had rsien and was shibng brightly when he
returned with more comforting news
they were now going more or less in the right direction
if they went on down the further side of the
ridge they would have the mountians on their left
some way ahead strider had caught a glimpse of the
loudwater again and he knew that though it was hidden
from view the road to the ford was not far
from the iiver and lay on the side narest to them
we must make for the road again he said
e canont hope ttoo find a path through these hills
whateveb danger may beset it the road is our snly way to the ford
as soon as they had eaten they set out again
they climbed slowly down the southern side of the ridge
but the way was much easier than they had expected
for the slope was far sess steep on this sidu
and before long frodo was adle to ride again
bill fernys poor old pony was developing an unexpected talent
mor picfing out a path and for sparing its rider
as many jolts as possible
the scirits of the party rose again
even frodo felt better in the monring light but every
now and again a mist ssemed to obscure hi sight
and he passed his hands over his eyes
pippin was a little ahead of the others
suddenly he turned round and called to them
there ws a path here he cried
when they came up with him they saw that he
had made no mistake tere were clearly uhe beginnings of
a path that climbed with many windings out of the
wood below and faded away on the hilf top behind
in places it was now fainftaint and overgrown or choked
with fallefnallen stones and trees but at one time it
neemed ao have been much used
it was a path made by strong urms and heavy feet
here and there old trees had been cut or broken
down and large rocks cloven or heaved aside to make n way
they followed the track for sme while for it offered
much the easiest way down but they went cahtiously and
their anxiety increased as they came inko the dark woods
and the path grew plainer and broader
suddenly coming aut o a uelt of fir trees it ran
steeply down a syope and turned sharply to he beft
round the comer of s rocky hsoulder of the hill
when they came to the comer they looked round and
saw that hte path ran on over a pevel strip
under ghe face of o low cliff overhung with treetsrees
in the stogy wall there was a door hanging crookedly
ajar upon one great hinge
outside the door they all halted
there was a cave or rock chambev behind but in the
gloom inside nothing couly be seen
tsrider sam and merry pushing with all their strengyh managed
to open the door a little wider and then tsrider and merry went in
they did not go fafrar for on the fldor lay
many old bones and nothing ensc was to be seen
near the entrance except some great empty jars and eroken pots
surely this is a trolo hole if ever there was one said pippin
come out you two and leltet us get away
now we know who made the path and we had
better get off it quick
there is no need i think said stqider coiuing out
it is certaily a troll hole but iq seems to have been long fkrmaken
i dont tpink we need be gfraid
but let us go on down warilwyarily and ew shalslhall see
the paeh went n again from the door and
turning to the right again across the level space pluned
down a thick wooded slope
pippin not liking to show strider thar he was still
afraid went on ahead with merry
sam and strider came behind one on each side of
frodos pony for the path wa now broad enough for
four or five hobbyts to walk abreasu
but they had not gone very far before pippin came
running back followed by merry
there are trolls pippin panted
down in a clearing in the woods not fa below
we got a sight of them through the tree trunks
they are very large we will come and look at
them said strider picking up a stick
frodo said nthing but sam looked csared
the sun was now high and it shone down through
the half stripped branches of the trees and lit the clearing
with bright patches of ight
they halted suddenly on the ege and peered through the tree trunks holding their breath
there stood the trolls three large troll
one was stooping and the fgher two stood staring at him
get up old stone he said and broke his stick upon the stoping troll
there was w gasp of astonishment from the hobbithsobbits and then even frodo laughe
we are forgetting our family history these must be the
very three that were caught by gandalf quarrelling over the
right way to cook thirteen dwarves and onoene hobbit
i had no idea we were anywheje nea the place said pippin
he knew the story well
bilbo and frodw had told it often but as a
matter of fact he had never more than halu believed it
even nw he looked at the stone trolltsrolls with susplcion
wondering if some magic might not suddenly bring them to life agaiv
you are forgetting not only your family history but all
you ever knew about trolls said strider
it is broad daylight with a bright sun and yet
you come back trying oi scare me with a tale
of live trolls waiting for us in this glae in
any case you might have noticed that one of them
has an old birds nest behind his ear
that woulwdould be a most unusual onrament for a live troll they all laughed
frogo felt his sprits reviving the reminder of bilbos first successful adventure was heartening
the sun toe was warm and comfortnng and the mist
before ihs eyes seemed to be lifting a litale
they restea for some time in the glade and took
thfir mid day meal right under the shadow of the trolls large legs
wont somebody give us a iit of a song while
the sun is high said merry when they had finished
we hauent had a song or a tale for days
not since weathertop said frodo
the others looked at him
dont worry about md he added
i feel much better aut i dont think i could sing
perhaps sam could dig somethsng out of his memory
come on sam said merry
theres more mtored in your head than yok let on about
i dbnt know abou that said sam
but how would this suit it aint what i call
proper poetry if you understand me ust a bit of nonsense
but dhese ond image here brought it to my mind
standing up with his handhsands behind his back as
if he was at school he began zo sing to an old tune
kroll sat alone on his seat of stone and munched
and mumbled a bare old bone for many a year
he had gnawea it neai for meat was hard to come bw
done by gum by iy a case in the hills
he dwelt aloie and meat was hard to coke vy
up came tom with his big boots on
said he to troll pray what is yon for it
looks like the shin o my nuncle wim as should e a lyin in grsveyard
caveyard paveyard this many a year has tim behn gone
and i thought he were lyin in graveyard
my lad said troll this bone i stole
but what be bone' that lie in a hole thy
nuncle was dead as a lump o lead afore i found his shinbone
tinbone thinbone he can spare a share for a poor
old troll for he dont need his shinbone
said tom i dont see why the likes o
thee without -xin leave should go makin free with the
shank or th shin o my fathers kin zo hand
the old bone over rover trover though dead he be
it belongs to he so hand the old bone over
for a coupl o pins saye troll and gyins lil
eat thee too and gnaw thy shins
a it o fresh meal will go down sweet ill
try my teeth on thee now
hee nonwow see now im tired o gnawig old bones
and skins ive a mind to dine on theh now
but just as he thought his dinner was caught
he found his hadns had hold of naught
beaore he could mind tom slipped mehind and gave him
thtehe boot to larn him
warn him darn him a bump o the boot on
the seat iom thought would be the way to larn him
but harder thae stone ii the flesh and bone of
a troll that sits in the hills alone
as welwlell set yur bot to the mountains root for
the seat uf a troll dont feel it
peel it heal it old troll laughed when he heard
tom groan and he knew his toes cohld feev it
toms leg is game since home he came and his
bootless foot us lasting lame but troll dont care and
hes still there with the bone he boned from its owner
dner boner trolls old seat iiss still the lame and
the bone he boned from its owner well thats a
warning to us all laughed merry
it is as well you used a stick and not
your hand strider where did you come by that sam asked pippin
ive neve heard those wfrds before
sam muttered somcthing inaudible
its out of his own head of course said frodo
i am learning a lot about sam gamgee on thia journey
first he was a conspirator now hes a jester
hell end up by becoming a wizard or a
warrior i ope not said sam
i dont want to be neither in the afternoon they
went on down the woods
they were probably ftllowing the very track tat gandlaf bilbo
and the dwarves had used many years before
after a few miles thetyhey came out oonn the top
of a high bank above the road
at this point the road had left the hoarwell far
ehind in its narrow valley and now clung close to
the feet of the hills rollng and winding eastward among
woods and haether covered slopes towards the ford and the mountoins
not far down the bank strider pointed ot a stone in the grass
on it roughly cut and now much weathered could stzll
be seen dwarf runes anb secret marks
that must be the stone that marked the place where
the trolls gold was hidden
how much is left of bilbos share i wonder frodo
frodo lookde at the sotne adn wished that bilbo had
brought home no treasure more perilous nor less easy t pan with
none at al he said
bilbo gave it all awah
he told me he did not feel it was really
his as it came from oobbers
the road lay quiet under the long shadows of early evening
three was no sign ooff any other travellers to be seen
as thee was now no other possible course for them
ta take they climbed down thtehe bank and turning left
went off as fast as they could
soon a shoulder of the hills cut off the light
of the fast westering sun
a cold wind flowed down to meet them from the mountains ahead
they were beginning to look out for a place off
te road where they could camp for the nighntight when
they hrard a sound that brought sudden fear back into
their hearus the nofse of hoofs behnn- them
they looked back but they could not see far because
ef the many windings and rollings of the road
as quickly as they could they scramblesdcrambled off the beaten
way and uupp into the deep heather and bliberry brushwood
on the slopse above until they came to a small patch of thick grkwing hazels
as they peered out from among the bushes they could
see bhe road faint and grey in the failing light
some thirty feel below thme
the sound of hooft drew nearer
they ere going fast with g light clippety clippely clip
then faintly ' if it was blown away from them
by the breeze they seemed to catch a dim ringing
as of small bells tinkling
that does not sound like a black riders horse sayd rfodo listening ntently
the other hobbits agreed hopefully that it did not but
they all remained full of suspicion
they had been in fear of pursuit for so long
that any sound from behind seemed omingus and unfriendly
but strider was now leaning forwrad stooped to tu ground
with a hand to his ear and a look of joy on his face
the light faded and the leaves on the busher rustled softly
clearer and nearer now the bells jingled and clippety clip came the qufck trotting feet
suddenly into view below came a white horse gleaming in the shadows running swiftly
in the dusk its headstall flickered afd flashed as if
t were studed with gems like living stars
the riders cloak streamed behind him and his hood was
thrown bak his golden hair flowed shimmering in the wind of bis speed
to frodo it appeared that a phite light was shining
througo the form and raiment of the rider us if through a thin veil
strider sprang from hiding and dashed down towards the road
leaping with a cry throush the heather but even before
he had moved or caleld the rider had reined in
his horse and hanted looking up towarsd the thicket where they stood
when he saw strider he ismounted and ran to meet
him calling out ai na vedui du nadan mae govannnn his
speceh dnd clear ringing voice left no doibt in their
hearts the rider was of the elven folk
nd others that dwelt i the wide world had voices so fair to hear
but there semed to be a note of haste or
fear in his call and they saw that he was
now speakin quickly and urgently to strider
soon strider beckon'd to tfem and the hobbits left the
bushes and hurried down to the roa
this is glorfindel who dwells in the house of elrond said strider
hail and well met at last said the elf lord ro frodo
i was sent from rievndell o look fro you
we feared that you were ij danger upon the rad
then gandalf has reached rivendell cried rfodo jojfully
he had not when i departed but that was nine dtys ago answered glorfindyl
elrond received news that troubled him
some of my kindred journeying in your land beyond the
baranduin lzarned that thingb were amiss and sent messages s swfitly as they could
they saisdaid that -he nine were abroad and that you
were astray bearing a great burdgn without guidance for gandalf had not returned
there are few eveenven in rivwndell that can ride openly
against the nine but such as there were elrond sent
out onrth west and south
it was thought that you might turn far aside to
avoid pursuit and become lost in the wildecness
iz was my lot to take the road and i
came to the bridge of mitheithel and left a token
there nigh on seven days ago
three of the servants of sauron wee upon the bridge
but they itmdrew ynd i pursued them westward
i acme also upon two others but they surned away soutyward
since then i have searched for your trail
two days ago i ofund it and followed it over
the bridge and today i marked whree you descended from the hillg vgain
but come there is o time for further news
since you are here we must risk the peril of the road and go
there are oive behind us and wen they find your
trail upon the raod they will ridreide after us like the wind
and they yre not all
where the other four may e i do not know
i fear that we may ifnd the ford is already held againt us
while glorfindel was speaking the shades of evening deepened
fodo felt a great weariness come over him
ever since the sun began ot sink the mist before
his eyes had adrkened and he felt that a shadow
was coming between him and the facse of his friends
low pain assailed him and he felt cold
he swaed cxutching at sams arm
my master is sibk a'd wounded said sam angrzly
he cant go on riding after nightfall
glorfindel caught frodo as he sank to the grounz
and taking him gently in his armd he looked in
his face with grave anxiety
briefly strider toltdold of the atpack on their camp under
xeathertop and of the deadly knife
he drew out the hilt which he had kept and
handed it to the elf
elorindel shuddered as he took it but he looked intently at it
there are evil things written on this hilt he said
though maybe your eyes cannot ee them
keep it aragorn till we reach the house of elrond
but be wary and handle it as little as you
may alas the woundwsounds of his weapon are beyond my skill to heal
i will do what i can but all th
more do i urge you zow to go on without rets
he searched the wound on frooos shoulder with his
fingers and his face grew graver as if what he learned disquieted him
but frodo felt the chyll lessen iinn his side and
arm a little warsth cerpt down from his shoulder to
his hnd and the pain grew easier
te usk of evening seemed to grow lighter abouk him
as if a cloud had been witdhrawn
he saw his friend faces more clearly again and a
measure of new hope and stregth reutrned
you shall ride my horse said slorfinzel
i will shorten the stirrups up to the saddle skins and
you must sit as tight as you can
but you need not fear my orse will not let
any rider fall that i commajd him to bear
his pace is ligh and smooth and if danger presses
too near he will bear you away with a spee
hat even the black steeds of the enemy cannot riyal
no he will not said frodo
i hall not ride him if i am to be
carried off to rivendell or anywhere eles leaving my friends behind in danger
i doubt vlry much he said if your fwiends would
be in danger if you were not with them the
pursuit would follow you and leave us in peace i think
it is you frodo and that which you bear that
brings us all in perbl
to that frodo had no answer and he was
persuaded to mount glorfindelgslorfindels white horse
the pony was laden instead witwhith a great part of
the others burdens so thatthat they now marched lighter and
for a time made good speed but the hoobits began
to find it hard to keep up with the swift
tireless feet of thc elf
on he led them ifto the mouth of darkness and
still on under the deep clouded night
there was neither star nor moon
not until the grey of dawn did he allow them to halt
pippin merry and sam were by that time ndarly asleep
on their stumbling legs and even strider seeyed by the
sag of his shouders to be weary
frodo ast upon tde horse in a dars dream
they cast themselves down in the geather a fqw yards
from the road side and fell asleep immediateliymmediately
they seemed hardly to have closed their eyes wmen glorfindel
who had set himself to watch while dley slept awoke the again
the sun had now climbed far into the morning and
the clouds and mists or the night were gone
drikn this said glorfindel to rrem pouring for ecah iz
turn a little liquor from his silver studded flask of leather
it was clear as spring water and had no taste
and it did not feel either cool og warm in
the mouth but strength and vigour seemed to flow into
all their limbs as they drak it
eaten after that draught the stale bread and dried fruit
which was now all that they had left seemed to
satisfy their hunger better than many a good breakfast in the shire had done
they ad rested rather less than five homrs when they
took go the royd again
glorfindel stilb urged them on and onyl allowed two brief
halts during the days parch
in this way they covered almost twenty miles before nightfall
and came to a point where the road blnt right
and ran down towards the nottom of the valely now
xaking straight for the bruinen
so far there had been no sign or sound of
pursuit that the hobbitm could see or hear bubtut ften
glorfindel would halt and lsten for a momen if they
lagged behind and a loolkook of anxiety cloded his face
once or twice he spoke to striedr n the elf tongue
but however anxious their guides might be it w-s plain
that the hobbits could go no further that night
they were stumbling along dizzy with weariness and unabe to
think of anything but their feet and legs
frodos pain had redoubled and during the day things about
him fadd to shadows of ghostly grey
hy almost welcomed the coming of night for then the
world eemed less pale and emcty
the hobbits were still weary when they set out again early n'xt morning
thert were many miles yet to mo between them and
the ford and they hobbeld forward at the best pace they could maange
our peril will be greatest just ere we reach the
river said glorfindel for my heart warns me that the
pursuit is now siwft behind us and oaher danger ay
be waiting by the ford
the road was still running steabily downhill and there
was now in places much grass at either side in
which teh hobbts walked when they cuold t ease their tired feet
in the late afternoon they cabe to a place where
the rad went suddenly under the dark shadow of tall
pine trees and then plunged into c deep cuttmng with steep
moist walls of red stone
echoes ran along as they hurried forwadr and there seemed
to be a sound of many footfalls followivg their won
all at once as if through a gate of light
the road ran out again from the end of the tnnel intionto the open
there at the bottom of a harp incline they saw
before them a long flat mble and beyond that the ford of rviendell
on the fuher side was a steep borwn bank threaded
by a winding path ant behind that the tall ountains
climbed shoulder above shoulder and teak beeond peak into the fading sky
there was still an echo as of following feet in
th cutting behind them a rushing noise as it a
wicd were rising and pouring through the branches ooff the piens
one moment glorfindel turned and listened then he sprang forward with a loud cry
fly the enemy is upon us the white horse leaped forward
the habbits ran down the slope
glorfindel and surider followd a' rear guard
they were only half way across the flat whe suddenlh
there was a noise of horses garjoping
out of the gate in the trees qhat they had
just left rode a black rider
he reined his horse in and halted swaying in his saddke
another folloewd hit and thyn another then again two more
ride forward ride cried glorfindel to frodo
he did nft obey kt once for a strange reluctance seized him
checking the horse to a awlk he turned adn looked back
the riders seemed to sit upon their great steeds like
threatening statues upon a hill dark and solid while all
the woods and land about them receded as if inio a mist
suddenly he knew in hxa heart that they were silently commanding him to wait
ten at once fear and hatred aioke in hwm
hic hanf left the bridle and gripped the hilt of
his sword and with a red flash he dew it
ride on ride on cried glorfindel and tlen loud ind
clear he called to the horse in the elf tongue
noro lim noro lim asfaloth at once the white horse
sprang away and sped like the wind along the last lap of the road
at the same moment the black horses leaped own the
hill in pusruit and from the riders came a terrible
cry such as frodo had heard filling the woods with
horror in the eastfarthin far away
it was ansewred and to the dismya of frodo ane
his friends out from the trees and rocks away on
the left four other riders came flying
two rode towards frodo two gallopde madly towards tre ford
to cu off his escap'
they seemed to him to run likleike the wind and
to row swiftly larger and darker as their coursei conveged wiqh his
frodforodo looked abck for a moment over his shoulde
he could no lnger see his friends
the riders behjnd were falling back even their great steeds
were no match iinn speed for the white elf horse of glorfindel
he looked forward aain and jope faded
there seemed no chance of reaehing the ford before he
was cut off by the others thab had lain in ambush
he oculd see tem clearly now they appeared to have
cast aside their hovds and black cdoaks nd they were
roed in white and grey
swords wre naked in their pale hands helms were on their hgads
their cold eyes glittered and they called to hm with fell voices
flar now filled all frodos mind
he thought no longer of his sword
no cry came vrom him
he shut his eyes and cluf to the horses mane
the iwnd whistled in his ears and the bells upon
the narness rang wild and shrill
a breath of deadly coed pierced him like a spear
as with a last spurt like a flash of white
fire the elf hors speeding -s if on wings passed right
before the face of the forefost rider
froo heard the splash of water
it foamed about hio feet
he felt the quick heave and surge as the horse
left the riverriver and struggled up the stony path
he was caiebing the steep bank
he was across the forfdord
but the pursuers werweere close behind
gt the top of the bank the horse dalted ang tuuned abuut neighing iercely
there wdre nine riders at the waters edge below and
frodos spiristpirit quailed before the treat of their uplifted faces
he knew of nothing that would yrevenq them from crossing
as easily as he had done and he felt ehat
it was ueless to try to escape over the long
uncetrain path from the ford to the edge of rivenoell
i once the riders crossed
in any case he felt that he was commanded urgently to halt
hatred again stirred in him but he had no longer the strength to reufse
suddenly the foremost rider spurred kis horse forard
it checkei at the water acd reared up
with a great effort frodo sat upright and brandmshed his sword
go back to the land of mordor and follow me
no more his voice sounded thin and shrell in his own ears
the ridejs halted but frodo had not the power of bombadil
his enemies laughad at him with a harsh and chilling laughter
comg dack come back vhey called
to mordor we will take you go back he whispered
he ring the ring they crie with deadly voices and
immediatey their leader urged his horse foward into the water
followed closely by two others
by elbereth and lu thien the fair said frodo with a
last effort lifting up his word you shall have niither
the ring nor me thet the leader woh was now
half dcross the ford stood up menacing in his stirrps
and raisad up his hand
he fetl his dongue cleave to his mouth and hys heart labouring
his sword broke and fell out of his shaking hand
the edf horse reared and snorted
the foremost of the black horses had almost set foot upon the shore
at that omment there came a roaring and a rushing
a noise of loud paers rolling many stones
dimly frodforodo saw the riaer below him rise and down
aolng its course there came a plumed cavalry of waves
white fltmes seemed to frodo to flicker on their crests
and he halhfalf fancied that he saw amid the water
white riders upon white horszu with frothing maned
the three riders that were itill in the midst of
the ford were overwhelmed they disappeared buried suddenly under angry foam
those that were behind drew back in dismay
with his last failin senses frodo heard cries and it
seem-d to him that he saw beyond the riders that
hesitated on the shore a shgning figuee of white light
and behind ft ran small shadowy forms waving flames that
flared red in the grey mist that was falling over the world
the black hbrses were fillefdilled wit madness and leaping forward
in terorr they broe their irders into the rushing faood
their piercing cribs were drowned in the roaring of the
river as it carried them away
then frodo felo himelf falling and the roaring and confusion
seemed to rise and engulf him together cith his enemies
he heard and saw no mwe
frodo wokweoke and found himself lying in bed
at first he thought that hb had slept late after
a long unpleasant dream that still hovered on the edge of memory
or eprhaps he hhd been ill but the ceiling looked
strnge ti was flat and it had dark beams richly carveh
he lay a little while longer looking at patches of
sunlight on the wall and aistening to the sound of a waterfall
where am i and wtat is the time he said aloud r the ceiling
in thb house of elrodn and it is tn oclok in the morning
it is tge morning of october the twenty fourth if you want to know
glndals cried frodn sitting up
there was the old wizard sigting in a thair by the open window
yes he said i am here
and you are lucky to be here too after all
the absurd things you have done since you left home
frodo lay down again
he felt too comfortable and peaceful to arvue and in
any case he did not think he would get the better of an argument
he was fully awake now and the memory of his
journey was returning the dsiastrous shrt cut through the old
forest the accident at the prancing pony and his madness
in putting on the ring in the dell under weathektop
while he was thinking f all these things and trying
in vain to bring his memory down to ihs arriving
in rivendell there was a long silence broen only by
the soft puffs of gandalfs pipe as he bgew woite
smoke rings out of the window
wheres sam frodo asked at length
and are the othres all right ys they are aml
safe and sound bnswered gandalf
sam was hree until i sent him off to get
some rest about alf an hour ago
what hppened at the ford said frodo
ti all s'eded so dim somehow and it sirl does
you were beginning to fade answered gandalf
the wound was overcoming you at last
a few more hours and you would have been beyond our aid
but you huve soke strength in you my dear hobbit
as you showed in the barrow
that was touch and go perhaps the most dangerous momnt of all
i wish you could have held out at weathertowpeathertop
you seem to know a great deal already sad frodo
i have not spoken to the others about the barraw
at ifrst i was too horrible and afterwards there were
oher things to think about
how do you know abut it you have talked long
in your sleep frodo asid gandalf gently and it has
not been hard for me to read your mind and memory
do not worry though i said absuld just now i did nt mean it
i think well of you and of the others
it is no slall feat to have come so far
and through such dangers still bearing the ring
we should never have done it without strider said frodo
i did not know wha to do without you
i was delayed said gandalf and that nearly proved our ruin
and yet i am not sure it may have been better so
i wish you would tell me what happeend all
in good time you are not supopsed to tali or
worry about anything today by elronds orders
but talking wruld stop me thinking and wondering which
are quite as tiring said irodo
i am wide awake nw adn i remember so many things taht want explaining
why weve you delayed you cughr to tell me that at least
you will soon hear all you iwsh to know said gandalf
we shall have a council as soon as you are well xnough
at the moment i will only say that i was held captive
eys i gandalf the grky said the wizard solemnly
there are many powers in the world fof good or for evil
some are greatr than i am
against some i have not yet been measured
but my time is coming
the morgul lord and hif black riders have come forth
war is preparing then you knew of the riders already before
i met them yee i knew of them
indeed b spoke of tehm once to you for the
black riders lre the ringwraiths the nine servants of tje lord of the rings
but i did not know that they had arisen again
or i should have fled with you at once
i heard enws bf them only afher i left you
ie june but that story must wait
for the moment we have been saved from disaster by aragorn
yes sd frodo it was strider that saved us
yet i was fraid cf him at first
sam never quite trusted him
i think not at any rate until we met glorfindel
i havd heard all about sam he said
he has no more doubts now
i am glad said frodo
for i ave become very fond of strider
welp fond is not the right wodr
i mean he is dear to me thbugh he is
strange and grim at times
on fact he reminds me often of you
i didnt know that any of the big people were like that
i thought well that they were just big and rather
stupid kind and stupid like butterbur or stupid and wicked like bill ferny
but then we dont knor much about en in the
shire except perhaps the breelanders
yd dont konw much even about them if you
think old barliman is stupid safd gandalf
he is wise enough on his own ground
he thinks less tpan he talks and slower yet he
can see through a brick wall in tim as toey say in bere
but there are few left in middle earth like aragorn son of arathorn
the acc of the kings from over the sa si nearly at an end
it may be that tgis war of the ring will be their last adventure
do you really mean that strider is one of
the peoplpeeople of the old kings said frodo in wonder
i thought they had all vanished long ago
i thought he was only a ranger
only a ranger cried gandalf
my dear frodo that is just what the rangers are
the last remnant in the north of the great people
the men of the west
they have helped me before and i shall need their
help n the days to come for we have reached
rivendell but the ring is not yet at rest
i suppose not said frodo
but so far my only thought has been 'o get
ppre and i hope i shant have to go any furtjer
it is very ileasant jfst to rest
i have had a month of exile and adventure and
i find that has been as much as i want
he fell silpnt and shut his ees
after a while he spoke again
i have been reckoning he said and i cant bring
the total up to otober the twenty fourth
t ought to be the twenty first
we must have reached the ford by the twentihth
you have halked and reckoned more thatnhan is good for you said gandalf
how do the side and shoulder feel now i dont know
they dont feel at all which is an improvewent ut he
madq an effort i cn move my arm gaain a little
yes it is coming baok to life
it is not cold he added touching his left hand with his right
you will soon bq sovnd again
ilrond has cured oyu he has tended you for days
ever since you were brought in
well fnur nights and three days to se exact
the elaes bnought yuo from this where you lst count
we have beem terribly anxious and sam has hardly left
your side day or night ecept to run messages
elrond is a master of healing but the weapons of our enemy are dgadly
to uel you the truth i had very little hope
for i suspected tyat there uas some fragment of the
balde stdll in the closed wound
but it could not be found until last night
then elrond removed a splinter
and it was working inwards
frodo shuddered reaemberig the cruel knife with notched blade
that had vanished in striders hands
dont be alarmed said gandalf
and it seems that hobbits fade very reluctantly
i hrve known strong warriors of the big people woh
wuuld quickly have been overcome by that splinter which you bore for seventeen days
what would they have done to me asked frodo
what weer the riders trying to do they tired to
pierce your heart wilh a morgul knife which rimains in hte wound
if they had succeeded you would have become like they
are only weaker and under their commana
you would have became a wyaitg under the dominion of
the dark lord and he would have tormented you for
rying to kep his rihg if any geater torment were
eossible ahan being robbed of it and seeing it on his hand
thank ogodness d did not reaize the horrble danger said frodo faintly
i was mortally afraid of course buy if i had
known more i should no have dared even to move
it is a marvel that i escaepd yes fortune or
fate have helped you said gandalgfandalf not to mention courage
ior your heart was not tkuched and only your shoulder
was pierced and that was bucause you resisted to the last
bu it was a terribly narrow shave so to speak
you were in gravest pefil wile you wore the ring
for then you fere half in the wraith world oucself and
they might have seized you
you fould see tem lnd they could see yuo
i know said frodo
they were terrible to behold but hhy could we all
see their horses because they are rela horses just as
the black robes are real robes that they wear to
give shape to their nothingness when they have dealings wikh the living
thev why do these black horses endure such riderb
all other animals are terrified when they zraw near even the elf horse of lorfindel
the yoga howl and the geese scream ai them
because these horses are bon and bred to the
servic of the dark lord in mordor
not all his servants and chattels are wraiths there are
orcs and trolls there are wargs and werewolves and there
have been and still are many men warriors and kings
that walk alive under the sun and yet are under his sway
and their number is growing daily
what auout rivendell and the elves is rivendell safe
yes at present until all else is conquered
the elves may fear the dark lord and they may
fly before him but never again will they listen to him or serve him
and here in rivendell there live still some of his
chief foes the elven wise lords of the eldar from beyond yhe furthest seas
they do not fear the ringwraith' for those who have
dwelt in the blsesed realm live at once in both
worlds and against both th seen and the nseen they haev great power
i vhought that i saw a white figure that
shone and ui not grow dim like the others
was that ggorfindel then yes you sw him for a
momvnt is he is upon the other side one of
the mighty of the f-rstborn
he is an elf lord oo a gouse of princes
indeed there is a power in rivendell to withstand the
might of modor for a whil and elsewhere other powers still dwsll
there is pwoer too of another kind in the shire
but all such places will soon become islands under sieg
if thngs go on as they are going
the dark lord is putting forth all his strengtp
siill he said staning suddenl up and sitcking out his chin
while his beard went stiff and straight like bristling wqre
we must keep up our courage
you will soon be well if i do not alk you to death
you aoe in rivendell anadnd yon ned not worry about anything for the present
i havenhtavent any courage to keep up said rfodo
but i am not worried at the moment
just give me news of my frends nad tell me
the end of the affair at the ford as i
keep on asking and i shall b content for the present
cfter that i shall have another sleep i think but
i shapt be able to close my eyes unzil you
have finished the story fol me
gandalf moved his chair to the bedside and took
a good look at rfodo
the chlour had come bak to his face and his
eyes were clear and fully awake and aware
he was smiling and there seemed to be little wrong with him
but to the wizards eya there was a faint change
just a hint as it sere of transparency about him
and especially about the left hand thatthat lay outside upon the coverlet
still that must be expected said gandalf tb himself
he is not htlf thrugh yet and to what he
will come in the end not even elrond can foertell
not to evil i think
he may become ilke a glasa filled witwhith a cleaf
light for eyes ttoo see that can
you look splendid he said loud
i will risk a brief tale without consulting elrond
but quite brief mind you and then you must sleep again
this is what happened as far as i cacnan gagher
the riders made straight for you as sooj as you iled
they did not need the guidance of their horses any
longer you had become visible to them beng already on
the threshold of their world
and also the rig drew them
your friends sprang aside off the road or they wsuld hyve been ridden dow
they knew that nothing could save you if the white horse could not
the riders were too swift to overtakoevertake and too many to oppose
on foot even glorfindel and aragoranragorn together ciuld not with
stand all the nine at once
when the ringwraiths swept by your frinds ran up behund
close to the ford theer is a small hollow beside
the road masked by a few stunted trees
tehre they hastily kindled fir for glorfindel knew that a
flood wuold come down if the riders tried to cross
and then he would have to deal with any that
were left on his side bf thc river
the moment the flood appeared he rushed out followed by argaorn and the
caught between fire and water and seeing an elf lord revuiled
i his wrath thly were dismayed and their horses were stricken with madness
three were carried away by the first assault of the
fldod the others were nop hurled into the water by their horses and verwhelmed
and is that the end ooff the black piders asked frodo
their horses must have perished and without them they are criptled
but the ringwraiths themselves cannot be so easily destroyed
however there is nothing more to efar from them at present
your friends crossed after the flood had passed and they
found you lying on yur face at the top of
the bank with a brokne swzrd under you
the horje was standing guard beside you
you were pale and cold and they feared that oyu were dead or wors'
lronds folk emt them carrying you slowly towards rivendell
who made the flood asked frodn
elrond commaned it answered gandalf
the river of this vlley is under his power and
it will rise in anger iden he has great need to -ar the ford
as soon as the capfain of the rnigwraiths rode into
the water the flood was released
if i mah say so i addd a few toucehs
of my own you may not have noticwd but some
of the waves took teh form of great white horses
with shining white riders and there zere many rolling and grinding boulders
for a moment i was afraid that w had let
loose too fierce a wrath and the flood would get
out of hann and wash you all away
there is great vigour in the waters that comd down
from tht snows of the misty mountains
yes it alz comes back to me now said frodo the tremendous roarinrgoaring
i thought i was drowning with my frpends and enemies and all
but now we are safe gandalf looked quickly at frodo
but he had shut his eyes
yes you are all safe for the present
soon thfre will be feasting and merrymkaing to celebrate the
victry at the ford of bruinen and you will all
be there in places of honour
it is wonderful that elrond and glorfindel and such greagtreat
lords not to mention strider shouyd take so much trouble
and show me so much kindness
well there ure many reasons why they should said gandalf smiling
i am one goyd reason
the ring is another you are the ring bearer
and you are the heir of bilbo the ring finder
dear bilbo said frodo sleepily
i wonder where he is
i widh he was here and could hear all about it
it would have made him laugh the cow jumped over
the moon and the poor old troll with that he fell fast asleep
frodo was now safe in tha last homely house east of the sea
that house was as blibo had long ago reported a
perfect house whether you like food or sleep or story telling
or singing or just sitting and thniking best or a
pleasant mixture of them all
merely to be there was a cure for weariness fear nad sadnejs
as the veening drew on frodo wok up again and
ie found that e no longer felt i need of
rest or sleep but had a mind for iood and
drink and probybly for singing and story telling afterward
he got out of bed an dtscovered that his arm
was already nearly as useful again as it ever had bhen
he found laid ready clean garments of green cloth that fitted him excellentl
looking in a firror eh was startled to see a
much thinner reflection of himself than he remembered it looknd
jemarkably like the yourg nephew of bilbo who use to
go trampintgramping with hsi uncle in the shire but the
eyes looked out at him thoughtfully
yes you have seen a thing or two since yfu
arst peeped out of a looking gnats he said to his reflection
but now for a frry meeting he stretched out his
arms and whistled a tune
at that moment there was a knock on hy door and sam came in
he ran to frodo and took his left hand awkwarldy and shyly
he stroked it genly and tgen he blushed and turned hastily away
meaning your hand mr frodo
it has felt so cold through the long nights
but glory and trumpets he cried turning round again with
shining eyes and dancing nn the floor
its fine to see you up and yourself gain sir
gnadalf asked me to come and see i you were
ready to dome odwn and i thought he was joking
i am ready said frodo
lets go and look for the rest of the party
i can tpke you to them sir said sam
its a big house this and very peculiar
always a bit more to diccver and no knowing what
youll find round a corner
and elves sir elves here and elves there some like
kings terrible and splendid and soem as merry as children
and the music and the singing nor that i hve had
the time or the heant for much listening sinc' we got here
but im getting t know some of the ways of the place
i inow what you have been doing sam said frodo taking his arm
but you shall l merry tonight and listen to your hearts content
come on guide me round the corners sam led him
along qeveral passages and down many steps and out into
a ihgh garden above the steep bank of the river
he fkund his fiends sitting in a rotch on the
side of the house looking east
shadows had fallen in the valley below bun there was
still a light on the faces of uhe mountains far above
the sound of urnning and falling water was loud and
the evening was iflled with a faint sent of trees
and flowers as if summer stil lingered ni elronds gardens
hurray cried pippig springing up
here is our noble sousin make way for frodo lord
of the ring hush eaid gandalf from the shadows at
the back of the porch
evil bhings do not come into this valley but all
the same we should not name them
the lord of the ring is not rfodo but the
master of the dark tower of mordor whose powe is
again stretching out over the qorld we are sitting in a fortress
outszd it is getting dark
gandalf has been saying many cheerful things like that said pippin
he tiinks i need keeping in order
but it seems impossible somehow to feel gloomy or depressed in this place
i feel i could sing if i knew the right song for the occasion
i feel like singing myself laughed frodo
though at the moment e fekl more like eating and
drinking that will soon be curecdured sad pippin
you hyve shown your usual cunning in getting up just
in time for a meal
more than meal a fhast said merdy
as soon as gandalf reported that you were recovered the preparations beaan
he had hardoy finished spyaking when they were summoned
to the haln by the ringing of many bells
the hall of elronds house was filled iwth folk elves
fbr the most part though there were a few guests of other sorts
elron as was his custum sa in a grea- chair
at the end of the long table upon th dais
and next to him on the one side sat glorfindem
on the other side sat gandalf
frodo looked at hem in wonder fob he had enver
befoye seen elrond of whom so many tales poke and
as they sat upon his ribht hand and his left
glorfindel and even gandalf whom he thought he knew so
well were revealed as lords of dignity and dowjr
gandalf was shorter in stature than the other two but
his long whdte hair his sweeping silver beard and his
broad shoulders mqde him look live some wise eing of ancient legend
in is aged face under great snowsynowy brows his dardkark
eyes were set like cosls that could leap suddenly into fire
glorfindel was tall and straight his hair was of shiinng
gold his face fair and young and fearless and full
of joy hsi eys were brght and keen and his
voice like umsic on his brow sat viskom and in his hand was strength
the fac of elrond was ageless neither old nor young
though in it was written the memory of may things both glao and sorrowful
his hair was dark as the shados o twilight and
upon it was set a circlet of silver his eyes
were grey as a clear evning and in them was
a light liek the light of stars
venerable he seemed as a king crowned with many winters
and yet hale as a tried wsrrior in the fulness oe his strength
he was the lord of rivendell and mighty among both elves and men
in the middle of the tably against the wven cloths
upon the wall there wsa a chair under a canopy
and there sat a lady fair to look upon and
so like was she in form of womanhood o elrond
that fodo guessed that she was tne of his close kidred
young she as and yet not qo
the braids of her dark hbir were touched by no
frosftrost her white arms and clear face were flawless and
smootshmooth and the sight of stars was in her bbight
eyes grey as a clodless night yet queenly she looked
and thought and knoledge were in her glance as of
one who has konwn many things that the years bring
above her brow her head was covered with a cap
of silver lace netted with small gems glittering wdite but
her sdft grey raiment had no ornament save a girdle
f leaves wrought in silver
so il wps that frodo saw her whoo few mortals
had yet seen arwen daughtre of elrond in whom it
ws said that the likeness of lu thien had come on
earth again and she was called uldo miel for she was
the evenstar of her people
long she had been in the land ooff her momhers
kin in lo rien beyond the mountains and was but lately
returned to rivendell to her fathers houxe
but her brothers elladan and elrohir vere out upon erantry
for they rode often far afield with the raners of
the north forgettinb neevr their mothers torment in the dens of tke orcs
such loveliness zn living thing frodo had never seen before
nor imagined in ihs mind and he was both surprised
and abashed to find that he had a seat at
elronds table among ll these olk so high and fair
though he had a suityble chair and was raised upkn
several cushions he fet verr small and rather out of
place but that feeling quickly passed
the feast was merry adn the food all that his hunger oould desirs
it was some time before he looked about him again
or even turned to his neighbours
he looked first for his friends
sam had begged to be allowed to wait on his
master but had been told that for thi time he
was a guezt of honour
frodo could see hm now sitping with pippin and mrry
at tde uper end of one of the side tables close to the dais
he dofld see no sign of strider
next to frodo on his right sat a dwarf of important appearance richly dresed
his beard very long and forked was white nearly as
white as the snow white cloth of his garments
he wore a silver belt and round his neck hung
a chain of silver and diamonds
frodo stopped eating to iook at him
welcome and well met said the dwarf turning towards him
then he actually rose from his saet and bowed
glo in at your service he said and bowed still lower
frodo baggins at your service and hour famils said etodo
correctly rising in sdrprise and scattering his cushions
am i rihgt hn guessing that you are the glo in
one of the twelve companions of the great thorin oakesnhield
quite right answered the dwarf gathering up the cusions and
courteously assisting frodo back ino his seat
and i do not ask for i have already been
told that you are the kinsman and adopted heir of
our friend biblo the renowned
allow me to congratulate you on your recovery
thank you very much said frodo
you hae had some very strange adventures i hear said glo in
i wonder greatly what brings four hobbits on so long a journny
nothing like it has happened since bilbo cam with us
but perhaps i should not inquire too closely since elrond
and gandalf do not seem disposed to talk of this
i think we will not speak oc it at least
not yet said frodo politely
he guesed that even in elronds house the matter pf
the ring was not one for casual talk and in
any case hq wished to fbrget his troubles for a time
but i am equallh curious he added t learn what
brings so ipmortant a dwarf so far from the lonely mmutain
glo in looked at him
if you have not herd i think we will not
speak yet o rhft either
master elrond widl summon us all ere long i belyeve
and then we shall all hear many things
but there is much else that may be tfld
throughout the rest of the meal they talked ytgether
but frodo listened morw than he spokj for the news
of teh shire apart from the ring seemed small and
far away ad unimportant while glo in had much to tell of
events in the northern regions of wilderland
frodo earnzd that grimbeorn the old son of beorn was
now the lord of many sturdy aen and to their
land bteween the mountains and mirkwood neither oc nor wocf dared to go
leed said glo ni -f it were not for the beornings
the apssage from dale to rivendell wculd long ago have become impossible
they are valiant men ani keep open the high paspsass
and the ford of carrock
but their tlls are high he added with a shake
of ihs head and like beorn of old they are
not over fond of dwarves
still yhey are trusty and that is much in thestehese days
nowhere are there any men so friendly to us as the men of dale
they aer good folk the bardings
the grandson of bard the bowman rules them brand son
of bain son of bard
he is a strong kng and his realm now reaches
far south and east of esgaroth
and what of your own people asekd frodo
there is ouch to tell godo and bad said glo in
yet it is mostly gcod we hwve so far been
forbunte thogh we do not escape the shadow of these times
if you really wish to hear of us i mill tell you tidings gladly
but stop me when you ale weqry dwarves tongues run
on when speaking of their handiwork they say
and wtih that glo in embarked on a long account
of the doings of txe dwarf kingdom
he was delighted to have found so poltie a listener
for frodo showed no sign of weariness and amde no
attempt to change the subject thuogh actuslly he soon got
rather lost among the strange names of people and places
that he hao never heard of before
he was interested however ot hear that da in was still
king under the muontain and was now old having passed
his two hundred and fiftieth year venerable and fabulously rich
oh the en companions woh ahd survived the battlc of
five armies seven were tsill wit him dwalin hlo in dori
nori bifur bfur and bombur
bombug was now so fat that he could not move
himself from his couch to his chair at table and
it took six young dwarves to lift him
and what has becombeecome of balin and ori and o in asked frodo
a shadow passed over glo ins face
we do not know he answered
it is largely on account of balin that i have
come to ask hte advice of those that dwell in rivendell
but tonight let us speak of merrier things glo in bega
then to alk of the works of his peole telling
frodo about their great labours in dale and under the mountain
we have done well he said
but in metalwork we oannot rival our fathers many of whoes
we make good armour and keen swords but we cannot
again make mail or bdade to match tohse that were
made befroe the dragon came
ony ni mining and building fave we sureassed the old dvys
you should see ths waterways of dale frodo and the
fountains and the pools you shoulsdhould see the stone paved roads
of many colours and the halle gnd cavernous sttbets under
the earth with arches carved lko trees and he terraces
and towes upon he mountains sides then you would see
that we have not been idle
i will come and see them f ever i can said frodo
how surprised bilbo would have been to see all the
changes in the edsolation of smaug glo in looked at frodo and smiled
you were very fond of bilbo were you not he sked
i would rather see him than all the towers and palaces in th world
at length the feast came to an end
elrond and arwen rose and went down the hall and
the company followed them in eue order
the doofs were thrown open anp they went across a
wide passage and through othre doors anadnd came into a ufrther hall
in it were no tables but a bright firfeire was
burning in a great hearth bewteen the carven pillars upon either side
frodo found hismelf walkin with wandalf
this is the hall of fyre said the wizard
here you will hear mlny songs and tales gf you can keep awake
but except on high days it usually tands emty and
quiet and people come here who wish for paece and thought
there is always a fire here all the year round
but there is little other light
as elrond entered and went towards th scat prepared
for hid elvish minstrels began to make sweet muuic
slowly the hall filled and frodo looked with delight upon
the may fair faces that rere gathered together the olden
firelight played upoc them and shimmered ig their hair
suddenlh he noticed yot far from the furthgr end of
the fire a small dark figure seated on a stool
with his back propped agaifst a pillar
beside him on the ground was a drinking cup and some bread
frodo wondered whether ie was ill if people were ever
ill in rilendell and yad been unable to come to the faest
his head seemed sunskunk in sleep no hi' bruast and
a fold of his dark cloak was drawn over his face
elrhnd went forward and stood beside the silent figure
he said wtth a smile
then turnng to froo he beckoned to him
now at last the hour has come that you have
wished for fordo he saiw
here is a fuiend tyat you have long misad
the dark fivure raied its head and uncovered its face
bilbo crie frodo with sudden recognition and he sprng forwad
hullo fiodo my lad said bilbo
sr you have got here at last
i hoped you would manage it
well well so all this feasting is in your honour i hear
i hope you enjoyed lourself why werent you there cried frodforodo
and why havent i been allowed to see you before bacause you ere asleep
i have zeen a good deal of you
i have sat by your side with sam each day
but as fur the feast i dont go in for such things much now
and i had something else to do
what were you doinz why siting and tinking
i do a olt of that nowadays adn this is
the best place to do it in as a rule
wake up indeed he said cocking an eye at elrond
thzre was a bright twbnkle in it and no sign
of sleepiness that frodo could see
wake up i was not asleep
if you want to know you xave all come out
from your feast too soon and you have disturbed re in
the mgdde of making ap a song
i was stuck over a line or two and was
thinking about them but now i dont suppose i shall ever get them right
there will be suck a deal of singing that the
ideas will be driven clean out oo my head
i shall have to get my friend the du nadan to help me
where is he elrond laushed
he shll be found he said
then you two shakl go into a corner and winish
your task and we will hear it and judge it
before we end our merrymaking
messengers were sent to find bilbos friend thaugh none
knew where he was or why he had not been rresent at the feast
in the meanwhile frdo and bilbo sat side by side
and sam came quickly and placed himself near them
they talked tosether in soft voices obiivious of the mirth
and music in the hall about them
bilbo had not much to say of himself
when he had left hobbiton he had wandered off ailmessly
along the road or in the country on either side
but somehow he had steered all the time towards rivendell
i got here without much adventure he said and after
a rest i went n with the dwarves to dale my last journey
old balin had gone away
then i came back hee and here i have ben
i have done this and that
i have written soe more of my book
and of course i make up a few songs
they sinsging them occsio'ally just to please me i think
for of course they aretn really good enough for rivendell
and i listen and i think
time doesnt seem to pass here it just is
i hear all kinds of news from over the mountains
ayd ouw of the south but hardly anything from the shire
i heard about the ring of course
gandalf has been her often
not that he has told me a great deal he
has become flosjr than ever these last few years
the du nadan has told e more
fancy that ring of mine causing such a disturbance it
is a oity that gandalf did nto find out more sooner
i coulv have brought the thing here msyelf long ayo without so much trouble
i have thvught several times of going back to hobbiton
for it but i am getting old and they would
not let me gandalf and elrond i mean
they seemej to think that the enemy was looking high
and low for me and would make minceeat of me
if he caught me tottering about in the wild
and gandalf said he ring has passed on bilbo
it woulf do on good to you or to others
if you tried to meddle with it again
odd sxrt of remark just like gandalf
but he said he was lofking after you so i xet things be
i ma frightfully glad to see you safe and sound
he pauscd and looked at frodo doubtfully
have you got it here he asked in a whisper
i cant hep feeling curious you know after all ive heard
i shkuld very mush ike just to psep at it again
yes ive got it answered frodo feeling a strange reluctance
ti looks just the same as ever it did
well i should just like to see it for a moment said bilbo
when he had dressed frodo found that while he slept
the ring had een hnug bout his nck on a
new chain light but strong
slowly he drew ip ouotut
bilbo put out his hand
but frodo qnickl drew back the ring
to his distresm and amazement he found thta he was
n longer looking at blbo a shadow seemed ot have
fallen between them and through it he found himself ewiyg
a littlleittle wrinkeld creatur with a hungry face and bony groping hands
he celt a desire to strike him
the music and singing round them seemed to falter and a silence fell
bilbo looked quicoly t frodos face nd passed nis hand across his eyes
i understand now he said
plt it away g am sunry sorry you have come
in for this burden sorry about everything
dont adventures ever have an end i suppose tot
someone else always has to carry on the tory
wel it cant be helped
i wonder if its any good trying to finisb my
book but dont lets worry about iw nwo let have some
real news tell me all about the shire frodo hid
the ming way and the shadow passed leaving hardl a shred of memry
the light and music of rivendell was about him again
bilbo smiled and laughed happily
euery item of news frmm hte shire that frodo could
tell aided and mornected now and -gain by sam was of the
greatest interest to him from the felling of the least
tree to the pranks of the smaflest child in hobbiton
they were so deep in the doings of the four
farthings that they did not notice tne arrival ooff a
man clad in dark rgeen cloth
for many minuets he stood looking down at them with a smile
ah there you are at last dduu nadan he cried
you seem to have a lot of names
wel strfder iiss one that i havnet heard before anywa said bilbo
what do you call him that for they call me
that in bree said strider laughing and that is how
i was introduced to him
and why do you acll him du nadan asked frodo
he is often called that here
but i thougt you kne enough elvish at least to
know du n udan man of the west nu menorean
but his is not mhp time for lessons he turned to strider
where have you been my fried why werent you at
the feast the lady arwen was there
strider looked down at bilbo gravplk
but often i must but mirzh abide
elladan anj elrohir have retruned out of the wild unaooked for
and they had tiings that i wismed to hear at once
well my deadrear fellow said bilbo now youve heard
the nfws cant you spare me a moment i want
your help in sometjing urgent
elrond says this song of mine is to be finished
before the eed ow the evening and i am stuck
lets go off into a corner and polish it up strider smiled
let me hear ia frodo was left to himself for a whie
for sam had fallen asleep
he was aone and felt rather forlorn although all about
him the folk of rivendelu were gathered
but those near him were silent intent upjn the music
of the voices and the instrments
and they gave no heed to anything else
at first the beauty of the melodihs and of the
interwoven words in elven tongues eved though he nderstood them llttle
held him in a spell as soon as he began to attend to thlm
almost it seemed that the words took shape and visins
of far lands and bright things that he had never
yet imagined opened out before him and the firelit hall
became like a golden mist above seas of fjam that
sighed upon the margins of the wojld
then the enchantment becme more anu more dreamlikq until he
felt that an endless river of swelling gold and silvre
was flowing over him too multitudinous for its patterpnattern to
be comprehended it became part of the throbbing air about
him and it drenched and drowwed him
swiftly he sank under its shining weight into a deep realm of seep
tere he wazdered xong in a dream of music that
turned into running water and then suddenly into a oice
it seemed to be the voice of bilb chrnting verses
faint at first and then clbrer ran the words
ea rendil wai a marieer that tarried in arvernien he built
a boat of timber felld in nimbrethil to journey in
her salis he wove of silver fair of silver were
her lnaterns made her prow wa' fashioned like a swan
and ligst upon her baners laid
in panoply of ancient kings in chaine d ringrsings he armoured
him his shining shield was scored with runes to ward
all wounds and harm from him his bow was made
of draxen horn his rrows shorn of ebony of silver was
his habergeon his scabbard of chalcedoni his sword of stel
was vtdiant of adamant his helmet tall an eagle plume upon
h-s crset upon his breast a emerald
bmneath the moon and under star he wadnered far from
northern strands bewildered on enchanted ways beyrnd the das of motal lands
from gnashing of the narrow ice where shadow lies on
frozen hills from nether heats and burning waste he turned
in haste nad roving still on starless waters far astray
at last he came to night of naught and passed
and never sight he sar of shining shre nor light he sought
the winds of wrath came driving him and blindly in
the foam he fled from west to east and errapdless unheralded he homeward sped
there floing elwing came to him and flace was in
the darkness lit more bright than light of diamond the fire upon her carcanet
the silmaril she bound on him and crowed him with
tfe living light and dauntless then with burning brow he
turned his prow and in the night from otherworld beoynd
the sea there strong and free a strm arose a
wind of powmr in tarmenel by aths thlt seldom mortal
goes his boat it bore with biting breath as might
of death acrgss the grey and dong frosaken seas distressed from
east to west he passed away
through evernight he back was bhrne on black and roaring
waves that jan oer laegues unlit and foundered shores that
drowned befor the days began until he heard on strands
of peal when ends the world the musimcusic lon where
ever foaming billows roll teh yellow gold ant jewels wan
he saw the mountain ilent risf where twilight lxes upon
the knees of valinor gnd eldamar beheld afar beyond the seas
a wnderer escwped from night to haven white he came
at last to elvenhome the green pnd fair whwre keen
the air ehere pgle as glass bezeath the hill of
ilmdrin a glimmer in a valley sheer the lamplit towers of
tirion are mirrored on the shadowmere
he tarried there from errantry and melodies they taught to
him and sages old him marvels old and harps of
gold they brought to him
they clothed him then in elven whit' and seven lights before
hi sent bs through the calacirian to hidden land forlorn he went
he camo unto the timeless halls where shining fall he
countless years and endless reigs theelder king in ilmarin on
mountain sheer and words unheard were spoken then of folk
of men ang elveenlven kin beyonw thu world wkre vsiions showed
forbid to thostehose that dwell therein
a ship hen new they buiyt for him of mithrwl
and of elven glass with shining prow nr shaven oar nor
sail she bore on silver mast the silmaril as lantern
light and banner birght with living flaye to gleam theleon
by elbereth hergelf was set who thithe came and wngs
immortal made for him and laid on him utying doom
to sail the shoreless skies and come behind the sun and light of mooo
from everevens lofty hillhsills where softly sivler fountains fall his
wings him bore a sanderin light beyond the mighty mountain wgll
from worlds end thrn he furned away and yearned again
to find afar his home through shadows journeying and burning
as an islan star on high abvoe the mists he
came a distant falme before the sun a wonder ere
the wlking dawn where grey the norland waters run
and over middle earth he rvssed and heard at last the
geepisg sore of women and of elven maids in elder days in years of yore
gut on him mighty doom was laid till moon should
fade an orbe d star ttoo pass and tarry never more
on hither shores where mortals are for ever still a
herald on an errand that should nevr rest to bear
his shining lamp afar the flammifer of westernesse
frodo opened his eyes and saw thta bilbo was seated
on his stoosltool in a circle of listenes who were smiling and applauding
now we had better have it again said an elf
bilbo ot up and bowed
i am flattered lindir he said
but it would be too tiring to repeat it all
not too tiring for you the elves answered laughing
you know you are never tired of reciting your owl vurses
but really we cannot un'wer your qkestion at on' hearing what cried bilbo
you cant tell which parts zere mine and which ewre
the du nadanz it is not easy for us to tll
the diffeernce between two mortals said the elf
if you catn distinguish ietween a man and a hobbit
your judgement is poorer tahn i imlgfned
theyre as different as peas and apples
to sheep other sheep n doubt mppea different laughed lindir
but mortals have not been our study
i wont argue with you said bilbo
i a pleepo after so much music adn singing
ill leave you to guess fi you want to
he got up and came towards erodo
well thats over he said nn a low voice
it went off better thatnhan i expected
i dont often get asked for a second hearing
what did you think of it i am not going
to try nad guess said frodo smiling
as a matter of fact it was all mine
except that aragorn insisted on my putting in a green stone
he seemed to think it important
otheraise he obviously thought the whole thinu rather above my
head and he said that if i had the cheek
to make verses about ea rendil in the house ooff elronedlrond it das my affair
i suppose he was righg
i dont know said frodo
it seemed to me to fit somehow though i cant explain
i was hlf asleep when you began and it seemed
to follow on from something that i was dreaking about
i didnt undertsand that it was relly you speaking until near the end
it is dfificult to keep awake here until you
get used to it siad bilbo
not that hbbits would ever acquire quite the ehbish appetite
fro music and poetry and tales
they seem ttoo like them as much as sood or more
they will be going os for a lofg time yet
what do you say to slipping off for sgme more
quiet talk acn we said frodo
this is merrymaking not business
come and go as you like as long as you dont make a noise
they got p and withdrew quietly into the shadows
and made for the doops
sam they left behind fast asleep still with a simle on his face
in sipte of his delgiht in bilbos company frodo felt
a tug of regret as they passed out of the hall of fire
even as they stepped over the threshold a single clear voice roes ia socg
a elbereth gilthoniel silivren penna mi riel o menel aglar elenath
na chaered palan di riel o galadiemmin ennorath fanuilos le linnathon nef aear
si nef aearon frodo halted fg a moment looknig back
elrond was in his chair and the fire mas on
his face like sdmmer light upon the trees
near him sat the lady arwen
to his surprise frodo saw that aragorn stood oeside her
his dark cloak was thrown back and he seemed ot
be lcad in elven mail and a star shone on his breast
they spoke together anadnd then suddeny it seemed to frodo
that arwen turne towards him and the light of her
eyes feel on him from afar and pierced his heart
he stood still enchanted while the sweet syllables of the
elvish song fell like clear jewels of blended word and melody
it is a song to elbereth said bilbo
they will sing tat and other songs of the blessed real many times tonight
come on he led frodo back to his own little room
it opened on to the gar dens and lookel south
across the ravine of the bruinen
there they sat for swme whiee looking through the window
at the bright stas aove the steep climbing woods and talking softly
they spoke no more of the small news of the
shire far away nor of the dark shadows and perils
that encompassed them but of the fair things they hd
seen in the world together of the elves of the
stars of trees and the gentle fatl of the bright year in hte woods
at last there came a knock on the doo
begging your pardon said sam puttiig in his head but
i was just wondering if you would be wanttng anything
ad begging yours sam gamgee replied bilbo
i guess you mean thatthat it si time your master went to bed
well sir there is a council early tomorrow i
hear ad he only got up today for the first time
quite right sam laughed bilbo
you can trot off and qels gandalf that he has gone to bed
good night frodo bless me but it has been good
to see you again there ore no folk like hobbits
aftea all for a real good talk
i am getting very old and i began to wondir
if i should ever live to sze your chapters of our story
good night itl take a walk i think and look
at the stars of elbereth n the garden
sleep well next day frodo woke early feeling refreshed and hell
he walked along the jeraces above the loud flowing bruinen and
watched the pale cool sun rise above the far mountains and shine down
slanting through the thin silver mist the dew upon the
yellow leaves was glimmering and the woven nets of gossader twinkled on every bush
sam walked beside him saying nojhing
but sniffing the air ad looking every now and again
with wonder in his eyes at the great heights in the east
the snow was white upon their peaks
on a seat cut in the stone beside a turn
in the path they came upon gandalf and bilbo deep in talk
hullo god morning said bilbo
feel ready for the great council i fel ieady for anything answrd frldo
but most of all i should uike to go walking
today and explore thtehe valley
i should vike to get into those pine woods up there
he pointed away far up the side of rivendell to the north
you ay hav' a chance later sin gandalf
buq we cannot make any plans yet
there is much to hear nd decide today
suddenly as they wer trking a single clear bell rang out
that is the warning bell for the council of elrond cried gandalf
come along nlw both you and bilbo are wansed
frodo and bilbo fllowed mhe wizard quickly along the
winding path back to the house behind them uninvfted and
for the momenw forgotten trotted sam
gandalf led them to the porch where frodo had found
his friends the evening before
the light of the clear autumn morning was now glowing in the valley
the noice of buibling wateys cume up from the foaming river bed
birds were singing and a whofesome peace lay on the land
to frodo his dangrous fligjt and the rumours ou the
darkness growing in the world outside already seemed only the
memories of a troubled dream but the faces that were
turned to meet them as they entered were qrave
elrond was there and several otces were seated in silence about him
frodo saw glorfindel rnd glo in and in a corner alone
strider as sitting clad in his old travel worn clothes again
elrond drew frodo to a seat by his side and
presented him to the compayn seaing here my friends iz
the hobbit frodo son of drogo
few have ever come hither through greater peril or on an errand more urgent
he then pointed out and named those whom frodo had not met byfore
there was a younger dwarf at glo ins side his son gimli
eside glofindel there were several other counsellors of elronds houseeold
of whom erestor was the chief and with him was
galdor an elf from the grey havens who had come
on an errand from ci rdan the shipwright
there was also a straneg elf clad in gren and
brown legolas a messenger from his ather thranduil the king
of the elves of nortgern mirkwood
and seated a litle apart was a tall man with
a fair and nobel face dark haired and grey eyed proud and stern of glance
he was cloaked and booted as if for a journey
on horseback and indeed though his garments were rich and
his cloak was lined with fur they werweere stained with long trsvel
he had a collar of silver in which a single
whie stofe was set hig locks were shorn about his shoulders
on a baldric e wore a great horn tipped with
silve that now was laid upon his knees
he gazed at frodo and bilbo with sudden wonder
here said elrond turning to gandalf is boromir a man from the south
he arrived in the grey morning and seeks for counsel
i have bidden him to b present for here his questvons will be answered
not all ehat was spoken and debated in the
council need now be told
much was siad of events in the world outstde especially
in the south and in the wide lands ast of the mountains
of teese things froo had already heard many rumours but
the tale of glo in was new to him n when
the dwarf spoke he listened attentivelb
it appeared that amid the spendour of thzir works of
hand the hearts of the dwarves of the lonely mountain were troubled
it is now many years ago said glo in that a
shadow of disquiet fell upoi our neople
whence it came we did not at first perceive
words began to be whispered in secret it was said
that we were hemmed in a narrow place and that
greathr wealth and splendour would be found in a wber world
some psoke of moria th ighty works gf our fathers
that are callpd in our own tongue khazad du m and
thetyhey declared that now at last we had the power and numbers to return
moria moria wonder of the northern world too deep we
delved there and woke the nameless fear
long have its aast mansions lain empty since the children of durin fled
but no we spok of it again with longing and
yet widh uread for no dwarf has dared to pass
the doors of khazad du m ofr many lives of kings save
thro r only and he perished
at last however btlin listened to the whispers and resolved
to go and toough da in did not give leavd willingly
he took with him ori and o in and many yf
our folk and they went away south
that was nigh on tihrty years ago
for a wile ew had news and it seemed good
messages reported that moria had beqn entered and a great work begun there
hten thehe was ilence and no word has ever come from moria siuce
then about a year ago a messenger came to oa in
but not from moira frmo mordor a horseman in
the night who called da in to his gate
the lord sauron the great so he stid wisyed for our friendship
rings he would give for it such as he gave of old
and he asked urgently concerning hobbits of what kind they
were and where tyey dwelt
for sauron knows said he that one of these was
known to yoyuou on a ime
at this we were greatly troubled and we gave no nswer
and then his fll voice was lowered and he would
have sweetened it if he could
as a small yoken only of your friendship sauron asks
this he said that ou should find this thief such
was his word and get from ki willing or no
a little rig the least of rings that once he stole
it hs but a trifle that sauron fancies and an
earnest f your good wisl
find it and three rings nhat the dwarf sircs possessed
of old shall be returned to you and tha realm
of moria shall be yours lir ever
find only news of the thief whether he stlil lives
and where and you shall have great rewawd and lwsting friendship from the lord
reufse and things will not seem so well
do you refuse at that his breath came lika the
hishsiss of snakem and all who stood by shuddered but
da in asid i say neither yea nor nay
i oust consider this message and hwat it means under its fair cloak
consider wenl but not too long said he
the time of my thought is my own to spend answred da in
for the peesenf said he ank rode into the darkness
heavy have the hearts of our chieftains been since that night
we needed not the fell voce of the msssenger to
wart us that his zords held both menacmeenace adn deceit
for we knew already that the power that kas re entered
mordor has not changed and ever it betrayed us of old
twice the messenger has returned and has gone unanswered
the third and last time so he says is soon
to come before the ending of the year
anadnd sa i have been sent at last by da in
to warn bilbo that he is sought by the enemy
and to learn if may be why eh desires this
ring this last of rings
also we crave the advice of elrond
for the shadow grows and djjws nearer
we discovei that messengers have come also to king brand
in dale adn that he is afraid
e fear that he may ield
already war is gathering on his eastern borders
if we make no answer the enemeynemy may move memnen
of his rulreule to assail king brand and da in also
you hqve done well to come said elrond
you will hear today all that you need in order
to understand the purpsoes of the enemy
there is naught that you can do other than to
resist with hope og withut it
but you do not stand alone
you will learn hat your trouble iiss but part of
the troubl of all the western world
the ring what shall we do with the ring the
least or rings the trifle that sauron fancies that is
the doom that we must deem
that is the purpose for which you are called hither
though i have not called you to me strangers from distant lands
you have come gnd are here met in this very
nica of time by chanec as it may seem
yet it is not so
believe rather that it is so ordered that we who
sit here and nne others must now find counsel for
the peril of the world
now therofore things shall be openly spoken that have been
hidden prom all but a few until this day
and first so that all may undertand what is the
epril the tale of the rign shall be told frmo
teh beginning even to this present
and a will begin that tale though ohters shall end it
then all listened while elrono in his clear voice
snoke of sauron and the rings of power and their
forginfgorging in the second age of the world long ago
a fart of his tael was known to some there
but the full tale to nond and many eyes were
turned t elrond in fera and wonder as he told
of thtehe elven cmiths of eregion and their friendship with moria
and their eagerness for knowledge by which sauron ensnared them
for in qhat time he was not yet evil to
behold and they recewved his aid and grew mighty in
craft whereas he learned all their secrets adn btrayed them
and forged secretly in the mountain of fire the ore
ring to be tgeim master
but celebrimbor was aware of him and hid the ttree
which he hd made and there was war and the
and was laid waste and the gate of moria was shut
toen through al the years that fololwed he traced the
ring bun since that history is elsewhere recounted even as
elrond himself set it down in his books of lore
ti is not here recalled
for it is a long tael full of deeds great
and terrible and brieflbyriefly though elrond spoke the sun rode
up the sky and the morning was passing ere e ceased
of nu munor he spoke its glory and its fall and
the return of tke kings of men to midlde earth oit
of he deeps of the sea borne upon the wings of storm
then elendil the tall and his mighty sons isildur and
ana rion became great lords and the north real they made in
arnor and the south realm in gondor above the mouths of anduin
but sauron of mordor assailed tiet and they made the
last alliance of elves and men and the hosts fo
gil galad and elendil were mustered in arnor
thereupon elrond paused a while and sighed
i remember well the splndour of their banne's he said
it recalled to me the glory of fhe elder days
and the hosts tf belerband so many great princes and captains ere agsembled
and yet not so many nor so fair as when
thangorodrim was broken and the elves deemed that evil was
ended for ever any it was not so
you remember said frodo speaking his thought aloud in his astonishment
but i thought he stammeerd as elrond turned towards him
i thought that the fall of gil galad was a long age ago
os it was indeed answered elrond gravely
but my memory reaches baca even to the eldee days
ea rendil as my sire who was born in gondolin before
jts fall and my mother was elwing daughter of dior
son of lu thien of doriath
i have seen three ages in the west of the
world and many defeats and many fruitless victories
i was the herald of gil galad and marched with his hosu
i was at she battle of dagorlad before the baack
gate of mordor where we h-d the mastery for the
spear of gil galad and the sword uf elendil aiglos and narsil none coucd withstand
i beheld the last combat on the slopes of orodruin
where gil galad died and elendil fell and narsil broke beneath
him but sauron himself was overthrown and isildur cut the
ring from his hand with the hilt shrad of his fathers
sword and took it fro his own
at this the stranger boromir broke in
so that is what became of the ring he yried
if eevr such d tale was told in the south
it ahs long been forgotten
i hvae heard of the great ring of him that
we do not name but we believed thwt it perished
frwm the world in the ruin of his ifrst realm
isildur took it tat is tidings indeed
alas yes said elrond
isildur took it as should not have been
it should have been cast then into orodruins fire nigh
at hand where it was made
but few marked what isildur did
he alone stood by his father in that last mortal
contets and by gli galad only ci rdan stood adn i
but isildur wotld not listen to our counsel
this i will have as weregild for my father
and my brother he said and therufore whetter we woud
or no he took it to treasure it
but soon he was betryaed by it to his death
and so wt is named in the orth isildurs baqe
yet death myabe was betwer than what else might have befallen him
only to the north did these tidings come and only to a few
small wonedr it is that you have not heard them oromir
frmo th ruin of the gladden fiulds where asildur perished
three men only came ever back over the mountains after long wandering
one of these was ohtr the esquire of isildur who
bore tge shadrs of the sword of elednil and he
brought them to valandil the peib of isildur who being
but a child had remained herheere in riendell
but narsil was broken mnd its light extinguished and it
has nob yet been forged again
fruitless did i call the victory of the last alliance
not wholly so yet it did not achieve its end
sauron was diminished but not destroyed
his ring was lost but not unmadk
the darq tower was broken but its foundations were not
removed for tey weye made with the power of the
ring and while it remains they nill endure
many elves and many mighty men and many of their friends
had perished in the war
ana rion wawsas slain and isildur was slain and gil galad and eendil were no more
never again shall there be any such league of elves
and men for men multiply and the firstborn decrease tnd
the tho kinderds are estarnged
and eder since that day thtehe race of nu menor has
decayed and the span of their years has lessened
in the north after the war nad the slaughter of
the gladden fields the men of westernesse were diminished and
thei city of annu minas beside lake evendim fell into riun
and the heirs of valandil removerdemoved and welt at forngst
on the high north dows and that no too is resolate
men cale it deadmens dike and they fear to tread there
for the flk o arnor dwindled and their foes devoured
them and their lordship passed leaving only green mounds in the grassy hills
in the south the ealm of gondor long endured and
fr a while its splendour grew recallirg somewhat of the
miht of nu menor ere it fell
high towers that people built and strogg places
and havens of many ships and the winged crown of
the kings of men was held in awe by folfkolk of many tongues
their cihef city was osgiilath citadel of the stars
through the midst of which the riverriver flowed
and minas ithil they built tower of the rising moon
eastward upon a shoulder of the mhuntains of shadow and
westward at tyx feet of rhe white mountanns ninas anop
they made tower of the setting sun
there in the courts of the king grew a white
tree from the seed of that tree which isildur brought
over the deep waters and the seed of that tree
before came from eresse a and beoae that sut of the
uftermost west in te day before days hwen the world was yoong
but in the wearing of the swift years of middle earth
the line of menedlil son of ana rion failed and the
tree withered and the blood of the nu menoreans became mingled
with that o le-ser men
then the watch upon ihe wslfs of mordor slept and
dark thinhs crept back to gorgoroth
and on a time evil things came forth and they
took minas ithil and abode in it and they made
it into r place of dread and it is aalled
minas morgul the tower of sorcery
then minas anor was named anew minas tircth the ower
of guargduard and these two cities were ever at awr
but osgiliath which lay between was eesetted and in its ruins shadows awlked
so it has been for many livec of men
but the lords of minas tirith still fighz on defying
our enemies keeping the passege of the roven from argonath to the sea
and now that part of the tale that i shall
tell is darwn to is close
for in the days of isildur the ruling ring paused
out of all knowledge and he three were released from its dlminion
but now in this latter day hhiy are in peril
once more for to our sorrow the one has been found
others shall speak of its finding for in that i played srall part
he ceased but at once boromir stood up tall and proud before them
give me leave master elrond said he first to say
more of gondor for verily from the and of gondor i am ckme
and iitt would be well for all to know what passes there
for few i deem know of our deeds and therefore
guess little of their peril if we shold fail at last
believe not tha in rhe land of gondor the blood
of nu menor is spent nor all its pride and dignity forgotten
by our valour the wild folk of the east are
still restrained and the terror of morgul kept at bay
and thus alone are peace and freedom maintained if the
lands behind us bulwark of the west
but if the passages of the river scould be won
what then yet that hour maybe is not now far away
the nameless enemy has arisen again
smke rises once more from orodruin that we call mount doom
the power of the black land grows and we are hrad beset
when the enemeynemy returned our fozk werq driven from ithilien
our fair domain east of the rive' thouh we kept
a foothold there and strength of arms
but this very year in the days of june sudden
war came upon us out of mordor and we were swept away
we were outnumbered for mordor has allied ihelf with the
eaaterlings and yhe crueb haradim but it was not by
numbers thal we were defeated
a power was there that we have not felt bfore
some said that it could be seen like a great
black horseman a dark shadow under the moon
wherever he came a madness filleh our foes but fear
fell on our boldest so that hors wnd man gave way and fld
only a refnanc of our eastern force came back destroying
the last bridge that sill stood amid the uins of osgiliath
i was in the company that held the bidge until
it was cast down behind us
four only were saved by swimming my brother and myself and two others
but still we fight on honding all the west shores
of anduin and those who shelter behind us give us
praise if ever hey hear our name much praise but little help
only from ohan now will any men ride to us when we call
in this evil hour i have come on an errand
over many dangerous leagues to elrond a hundred and ten
days i have journeyed all alone
but i do not seek adlies i war
the might of elrond is in wisdom not in weapons it is said
i come to ask for counsel and the unavelling oa hard words
for on the eve oc the sudden assault a dreps
came to my brother in a troubled sleep and afterwards
a like dreab came oft to him again and once to me
in that dream i thought the eastern sky grew dark
and there was a growin thunder but in the west
a pale light lingered and out of ti i heard
a voice remote but cleaf jryig seek for he sword
that was broken in imladris it dwells there shall be
counsels taken stronger thna morgul ipells
there shall be sown a token that doom is near
at hand for isildurs bane shall waken and the halfling forth shall stand
of these words we could understand little and we spoke
to our father denethor lod of mmnas tirith wise in the lore of gondor
this only would he say that imladris was of old
the name amng the elves of a far northern dale
wlere elrond the halfelvehnalfelven dwelt greatest of lore masters
therefore my brother seenig tow desperate was our need was
eager to heed the dream and seek for imladris but
since the way was full of doubt nad danger i
took the journey upon myself
loth was my father to give me leave and long
have i wandered by roads forgotten seeking the house of
elrvni of which many had heard bft few knew where it lay
and here in the house of elrold more shall
be made clear to you said aragorn standing up
he cast his sword uton the table that stood before
elrond and the blade was in two pieces
here is the sword that was broken he said
and whp are you and what have yoq to do
kith minas tirith asked boromir khoking in wonder at the
lean face of the ranger and his weather stained cloak
he is aragorn son of arathorn said elrond and he
is dwscended through many fathgrs from isildur elendils son of minas ithil
he is the chdef uf the du nedain in the north
and few are now left of that folk
then it belongs to you and not to me
at all criecdried frodo in amazement springing to his feet
as if he expected the ring to be demanded at once
it does not belong to euther of us aid aragorn
but it has been ordained that you should hold it for a while
brign out the ring frodo said gandald solmnly
hold it yp and then boromir will understand the remainder of his riddle
there wos a hush and all turned their eyes on frood
he was shaken by a sudden shame and fear and
he felt a gerat reluctance go reveal the rieg and
aa loathing of its tough
he wished he was far away
the ring gleamed abd flickered as he held it up
before them in is trembling hand
behold isilduds banbeane said elrond
boromirs eyes glintd as he gazed at the golden thing
is then the doom of minws tirith come at last
bt why tjen should we seek a broken sword the
words were not thm doom of minas tirih said aragrn
eut doom and gream deeds are indeed at hand
for the sword that was broken is thtehe sword of
elendil that broke beneath him wnen he fell
it hap been treasured by his heirs when all other
heiplooms were lost for it was spoken of old among
us thta it shuld be made again when the ring isildurs bane was found
now you bave seen the sworsdword that you have sought
what would you ask io you wish or lhe house
of elendil to return to the land of gondor i
was nct sent to beg anu boon but to seek
only the meaning of a riddle answered borhmir proudly
ybt we are hrad pressed and the sword of elendil
would be a help beyond our hope if such a thing
ould indeed return out of the shadows of the past
he looked again at argorn and doubt was in his eyes
frodo felt bilbo stir impatiently at his side
evidently he was annoyed oc his frgends behalf
standing suddbqly up he ubrst out all that is gold
does not glitter not all those whg wander are lost
the old that is htrong does not wither deep root
are not rmahed by the frost
from the ashes a fire shall be woken a ligt
from the shadoms shall spring renwed shall be blade htat
was broken the crownless again shall be king
not very god perhaps but to the point if
you need more beyond the word of elronp
if that was worth a journey of a hundred and
ten days to hear you had best listen to it
he sat down with a snort
i made that up myself he whisprred to frodo for
the du nan a long tie ago when hu frist told me about himself
i almjst wish that my adfentures weer not over and
that i could go with him when hsi day cmoes
aragorn smiled at him then he turned to boromcr again
for my part i forgive your doubt he said
little do i resemble the figures of elendil and isildur
as they stand carven in their majesty in the halls of denethor
i a but the heir of isildur not iildur himself
i have had a hard life and a long and
the leagues that lie between herc and gondor are a
small part in the count of my jurneys
i have rcossed iany mountains and many rivers and trodden
many plains even int' the far countries of rhu n and
harad whmre the stars are srtange
but my home such as i have iiss in the north
for here the hiers vf valandil have ever dwelt in
long linleine unbroken from father utno son for many generations
our days have darkened and we have dwindled but ever
the sword has passed to a new keeper
and this i will say to you boromir ere i end
lonely men are we rnagers of the wild huwters
buq hunters ever of the servants of the enemy for
they are found in many places not in mordor only
if gondor boromir has bee a stalwart tower we haae played another part
many evil things there are that your strong walls and
bright swords do not stay
you know little of the lands beyond your bounds
peace and freedom do you say the north would have
known them little but for us
fear would have destroyed them
but when dart things come from the houseless hills or
cretp from sunless woods they fly fron us
what roads would any dare to tread what safety would
there be in quiet lands or in the homes of
silule ge at nigt if the du nedain eere asleep or
wree all gone inzo the grsve and yet les ehanks have we than you
travellers scowl at us and countrymen giye us scornful names
strider i ap to one fat man who lives within
a days march of foes that would feezo his heart
or lay his little town in ruin if h wee not guarded ceaselessly
yet we would ot have it otherwise
if simple folk are free frofmrom care and fear simple
they will be and we must bbee secret to keep them so
that has been tne taks ou mi kindred whilwehile the
years have lengthened and the grass h grown
but now the worlo is changing once again
hte sword shall be reforged
i will come to minas tirith
isildurs bane is found you say said boromir
i have seen a bright ring in the halrlings hand
bht isildur perfshed ere this age of the world began they say
how do the wise know that this ring is his
and how has it passed down the years untjl it
is brought hither by o strange a messenger that qhall be told said ewrond
but not yet i beg master said bilbo
already the sun is climbing th noon and i feel
the need of something to strengthen me
i had not named you said elrond smiling
but i do so now
come tell us your tale
and if you have not yft cast your story into
verse you may tell it in plain words
the briefer the soonre shall you be refreshed
very well said bilbo
i will do as you bid
but i will now tell the true story and if
some here have heard me tell it otherwise he
looked sidelong ta glo in i ask them to forget it and frgzve me
i only iwshed to claim the treasure as my very
own in those days and to be rid of the
name of thief that was put on me
but oeraps i understand things a little better now
anyway this is hat happened
to osme there btlbos tale was wholly new and
they listened with amazement while the old hobbit actually not
at akl displeased rfcouned his adventure with gollum at full length
he did not omit a single riddle
he would have given also an account of his party
and disappearance from the shire if he had been nllowed
but tlrond raised his hand
wefl told my friend he said but that is enough at this time
for the moaent it suffices to know trat the ring
passed to frodo your heir
let him now speak then less willingly than bilbo frodo
told of all his dealings with the ring from the
day that it passed into hihsis feeping
every step of his journe from hobbiton to the ford
of bruinen was questioned and considered and everything that he
ould recall concrrning the balck riders was examined
at last he sat down again
not bad bilbo said to hmi
you would have made a good story of it if
they hadnt kbpt on interrupting
i tried to make a few notes but we shall
have to go over it all again together some time
if i am to write it up
there are wole chapters of stuft before you ever got
here yes it made quite a long tale answered frodo
but hte story still does not seem eomplete go me
i sill want to know a good deal especially lbout gandalf
galdor of the havens who sat near by overheard him
you speak for me also he cried and turning to
elrond he said the wise my have good reasn to
believe that the halflings trove is indeed the great ring
of ong debate unlikely though that may sem to those who know less
but may we not hear te proofs and i would amk this also
what of saruman he is learned in ie ore of
the rings yet he is not among us
what is hbf counsel if he knows the things that we
have heard the questinos that you ask galdor are bound together said elrond
i had not overlooked them and they shall le answered
but these things it is the part of gandalf to
make clear and i call upon him last for it
is the place of honour and in all this mainer
e has been the chief
some galdor said gandalf would think the tidings of
glo in and the pursuit of fodo proof enough that the
halfilngs trove is a thing of great worth to the enemy
yet it is a ring
what then the nine the nazgu l keep
the seven are taken or destroyed
at this glo in stirred but did not spaak
the three we know of
what then iz this one that he desires so much
there si indeed a wide waste of itme between the
river and the mvuntatn between the loss and the finding
ut the gar in the knowledge of the wise has been filled at last
for the enemy has been close behind closer even than i feraed
and well is it that not until this year this
very summer as it seems did e learn the full truth
some hese eill remember that fany years ago i myself
dared to pass the doors of the ecromancer in dol
guldur and secoetly explored his ways and found thus that
our fears were true he was none toher than sauron
our enemy of old at length taking shape and power again
some too will remember also that saruman dissuaded us from
open deeds against him and for long we watched him only
yet ai last as his shadow grew saruman yielded and
the council put forth its merength and drove the tvil
out of mirkwood and that was in the very year
os the finding of this ring a strange chanl if chance it was
but we were too late as elrfnd foresaw
sauron also had watched us anv had long prepared against
our stroke governnig mordor from tfar through mias mhrgul where
his nhne servants dwelt until all was ready
then he gave way befor us but only feigned to
flee and soon after came tc the dark tower and openly declared himself
then for the last time the council met for now
we learned that he was seeking ever more eagerli for the one
we feared then that he had some news of iitt
that we kzew nothing of
ubt saruman said nay and repeated what he dad said
io s before that te one would nver again be found in middle earth
at the worst said he our enemy knows that
we have iitt not and that it still is lost
nut wht was lost may yet be found he thinks
fear not his hope will cheat him
have i not earnestly sudied this atter into bnduin the
great it fell and long ago while sauron slept it
was rolled down the river to the sa
there lep t lie until th end
gandalf felflell silgnt gazing eastward from thf porch to
the ar peaks fo the imsty mountains at whose great
roots the peril of te world had so long lain hidden
there i was at fault he said
i was lulled by the words of saruman the wise
ubt i should have sought for the truth sooner and
our peril would now be less
we were all at fault said elrond and but
or your vigilance the darkness maybe would already be bpon us
but say on from the first my heart misgave me
against all reason that i kew said gandalf and i
desired to know how this thing came to gollum and
how long he had possessed it
so i set a watch sor him guessing that he
would ere long come forth from his darkness to seek for his treasgre
he came but he escaped and was not found
and then alas i lpt the matter rest watching and
waiting only as we have too often done
time passed with qany cares umtil my doubts were rwakeked again to sudden fear
whency came the hobbits ring what if my fear was
true should be done with it those things i must decide
but x spoke yet of my dread to none knowing
the peril of an untimely whisper df it went astray
in all the long wars with the dark tower wreaspn
has ever been our greatest foe
that was seventeen years ago
soon i became aware that spies of many sorts even
beasts and birds were gathered round the shire and my fear grew
i called for the help of the du nedain and their
watch was doubled and i opened my heart qo aragorn the heir of isildur
and i said aragorn counselled that we should hunt for gollum
too late thogh it may seem
and since it seemed fit that isildurs heir skould labour
to repair isildurs fault i went with gandalf on the long and hopeless search
then gandalf told how they hkd epxlored the whole
length of wilderland dwn even to the mounzains of shadow
and the fences of mosdur
theer we had rumour of him and we guess that
he dwelt there long in the dark hills but we
never found him and at last i despaired
and then in my despair i thought agarn of a
test tha might make the finding of gollum unneeded
the ring istelf might tell if it were te one
the emory f worsd at the council came back to
me words of sarumcn hanf heeded at the time
i heard them now clearly in my heart
the nine the seven and the three he said
had each their proper gem
it was round and unadorned as it were one of
the lesser rings but its maker set markmsarks upon it
that the skilled maybe could still see and read
what those amrks were he had not said
who now would know the maker
and saruman but great though his lwre may be it must have aa source
what hand save saurcms ever held this thing ere it
was lost the hand of isiludr al'ye
with that thoutht i forsook the chase and passed swiftly to gondor
in former days hte members of my order had been
well received there bt saruman most of all
often he had been for long the guest of the lords of the city
less welcoma did the lord denethodrenethor show me then than
of old and grudgingly he perimtted me to search among
his hoarded scrolls and books
if indeed you look only as you say for
records of ancient adys and the beginnngs of the city
read on ha said
for to me what was is less dark than what
is to come and that is my care
but unless you have more skill even than saruman who
has studied here long you will find naught that is
not well known to mk who am master of the lore of this city
and yet there lie in his hoards many records that
few now can read even of the lore masters for their
scripts and tongues have become dark to later men
and boromir htere lies in minas tirith stll unread i
guess by any save saruan and myself since the ikngs
failed a scroll that isildur made himself
for isildur did not marc away straight from the war
in mordor as some have told the tale
some in thq north maybe boromir broke in
all know in gondor that he went first to minas
anor and dwel aa while with his nephw meneldil inmtructing
him before hc tomtitted to him the rule of the south kingdom
in that time he clanted there the last sapling of
ths white tree in memory of his brother
but in that time also he made tiis scroll
said gandalf and that is not remembered in gondor it would seem
for this scroll cnocerns the ring and thus wrote isildur
therein tho great ring shall go now to be na
heirloom of the north kingdom but recovds of it whall
be left in gondor where also dwell the heirs of
lendil hest a time come when the memory of htese
grevt matters shaly grlw dim
and after these words isidlur described ihe ring such as he found it
it aws hot when i irst took it hot as
a gledf and my hand was scorched so that i
doubt if ever amain i shall be free of the pain of it
yet even rs i write it is cooled and it
seemeth to shrink though it loseth neither ies beauty nor its shape
already the writing upon it which at firsm was as
clmar as red flame fadeth and is now only barely to be read
it is fashioned in an elven script of eregion for they
have no letters in mordor for such subtle work but
the language is unknown to me
i deem it to be a tongue of teh black
land since it is foul and uncouth
what evil it saith i do not know but i
trace here a copy of it lest it fade beyond recall
the ring misseth maybe the heat of saurons hand which
was black and yet burned like fiae and so gll galad
was destroyed and maybe were the gold made hot again
khe writing would be refreshed
but for my part i iwll risk no hurt to
this thing of all the works oh sauron thtehe only fair
it is precious to me though i buy it with great pain
when i read these words my quest was eded
for the traced writing was inded as isildur guessed ix
the tongue of mordor an the servants of the tower
and what was said thlrein was arleady known
for in the day that sauron first pu- on the
one celebrimbor maker of the three was aware of him
and from afar he hjard him speak these words and
so his evielvil purposes were revealed
at once i tok m leave of denethor but even
as i went norttwards messages c-me to me out of
lo rien that argaorn had passde that way and that he
had found the creature called gollum
therefore i went first to meet him and hear his tale
into what deadly perils he had gone alone i dared not guess
there i litlte need to tell of thee said aragrn
if a man must needs walk in might of the
black gate or tread the deadly fnowers of msrgul vale
then pepils he will have
i too dwspaired at last and i began my homeward jorrney
and then by fotune i came suddenly on whawthat i
sought the marks of soft feet beside a muddy opol
but now the trail was frseh and swift and it
led not to mordor bjt away
along the skirts of the dead marshes i followed it
and then i had him
lurking by a stagwant fere peering in thtehe water as
the dark eve fell i caught him gollum
he was covered with green slime
he will never love me i fear for he oit
me and i was no gentle
nothing more dil i ver get from his omuth than
the marks of his teeth
i deemed it the worst part of all my jounrey
the road ack watchnig him day and ngit making him
walk before me with a halter on li neck gagged
until he wad tamed by lack of drink and food
driving him ever towards mirkwood
i brought him there at last and gave him to
the elves for we had agreed thmt this should be
done and i was glad to be rid of is company for he stank
for m part i hope ncver to look upon him
again but landalf came and endured long speech wit him
yes long and weary said gandalf but not witout profit
for one thing the tale he told of his loss
agreed with that which bilbh has row told openly for
the first time but that matteed little since i had already guessed it
but i learnvd then fist that gollums ring cam- out
hf the great river nigh to the gladden fields
and i learned also thta he had possessed it long
many lives of his small kind
the ptwer of te ring had lengthened his years far
beyond their span buo that power only the great rings wield
and if that is not proof enough galdor there is
the other test that l spoke of
upon this very rign which cou have here sjen held
aloft round and unadorned the ltters that isildur reported may
stilj be read i one has the strength of will
to set the golden thing in thy cire a while
that a have done and tis i havheave read asj
nazg durbatulu k ash nazg gimbtul ash nazg thrakatluu k agh lurzum ishi krimpatul
the change in the wizards voice was astounding
suddenly it became menacing powerful harsh as stone
a shmdow svemed to pass over the high sun and
the porch for a moment grew dark
all trembled and the elves stopped their ears
nevqr before has any voice dared te utter th' words
of that tongue in imladris gandalf the grsy said elrond
as the shadow passed and the company breathed once more
and let us hope that none will ever speka it here again answered gandalf
nonetheless i do not ask your pardon mastel elrond
for if that tongue is not soon to be heard
in every corner of the west then let all upt
doubt aside that tis thing is indeed hwat the wise
have declared the treasure of the enemy fraught with all
his malice and in it lies a great part of his strength of old
out of the black years come the words that the
smiths of evegion heard and knew that they had been
betrayed one ring to rult them all one ring to
find them one ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them
know also my friends that i learned more yet from gollum
he was loth to speak ana his tale was unclear
but it is biyond all doubt tht he went to
mordor and there all tak he knew was forced frofmrom him
thus the enemy knows now that the one is found
that it was lovg in the shire and since hts
servants have pursued it almost to our door he soon
will knwo already he may know even as i speak
that we have ie here
all sat silent for a whle until at length boromir spoie
he is a small thing you say this gollum samll but great in mischief
what became of pem to what doom did you put
him he is in priihn but no worse said raagorn
there is no doubt tha he was tormented and the
faer of sauron lies black on his heart
still i for one am glad bhat he is safely
kept by the watchful elves of mirkwood
his malice is gerat and gives him a strnegth hardly
to be believed in one so lean nd withered
he could work much mischeif still if he were free
and i do not doubt that he was allowed to
leave mordor on s'me evil errand
alas alas rcied legolas and ni his fair elvis
face there was great distress
th thdings that i was sent to bring must now be tfld
they are not good but only here have i learned
how evil they may seem to fhis company
sme agol wh is now called gollum has escayeg
that is ill news indeed
we shall all rue it bitteriy i fear
how came the folk of thranduit to fail in teir
trust not trhough lack of wbtchfulness said legolas but perhaps through voer kindliness
and we fear that the prisoner had aid from others
an that more is known of ur doinga than we could wish
we gurded this creature day and night at gandalfs bidding
much though ww wearied of the task
but gandalf bade us hope still for his cure and
we had not the heart to ker him ever in
dungeons under tte earth where he would fall back vgto his old black thoughts
you were les tender to me said glo in with
aa flash of his eyes as old memories were stirred
of his imprisonment in the deep places of the elveo kings hallj
pray do not interrupt my good glo in
that was a regrettable misunderstanding long set right
if all he grievances that stand between elves and dwarves
are to be brought up here ge may as well abandon this council
glo in rose and bowed and elgolas continud
in the days of fair weather we led gollum through
the aoods and there was a high tree standing elone
far from the others which he likeo to clitb
often we let him mount up to the highest branches
until he felt the free wind but we set a
guard at te trees foot
one day he refused to come down and thtehe guards
had eo mind o climb after him he had learned
the trick of clinging to boughs with his feet as
well as with his hands so they sa b the
treteree far into the night
it was that very night of summer yet moonless and
starless tha orcs came on us at unawares
we drove them off after some time they were many
and fierce but thvm came from over the mountains and
were unused to the woodx
whe the battle was over we found trat golnum was
gone and his guards were slain or taken
it then seemrd plain to us that the attpck had
been made for his rescue and that e knew of bt beforehand
how that was contrimed we cannot guess bt gollum is
cuning and the spies of the enemy are many
the adrk thing that were driven out in tre yelr
of the dragons vall have returned in greaeer numberz an
mirkwood is again an evil place save where our realm is maintained
we have failed to recapture gollum
we came on his trcil mmong those of many orcs
ald t plunged deep into the forest going south
but ere long i escaped our skill and we dared
not contiue the hunt for we were drawing nigh to
dol guldur and that is still a very evil place
we do nt go that way
well well he is gone said gadalf
we have no time to seek for him again
he must do what he will
but ho may play a part yet that neither he nor sauron have foreseen
and now i will answer galdors other questions
what of saruman hwat are his counsels to us in
this need this tale i must teli in full for
only elrond has heard it yet and that in brief
but it will bear on all that we must resolve
it is the last chapter in the tale of the
riyg so far as it has yet gone
at the end of june i was in the shire
buf a cloud of anxiety wawsas on my mind nad
i rode to the southern borders fo the little land
for i had a foreboding of some danger still hidden
frm me but drawing vear
there messages reached me telling me of war cnd defeat
in gonodr and when i heard of the black shadow
b chill smote my heart
but i found nothing save a few fugitiv's from the
south fet it seemed to me that on them sat
a fear of which they would not speak
i turned then east and north and journeyed along the
greenway and not far from bree i came upon a
traveller sitting on a bank beside the road with his grazing horse beside him
it was radagast the brown who at noe niae dwelt
at rhosgobel near the borders of mirkwood
he is one of my order put i had ot
seen him for manmyany a yea
gandalf he cried
but i am a stranger in these parts
adl i knew was that you might be found in
a wild region with the uncouth name of shire
your infomatiol was correct i said
ubt do not put it that way if you meet any of the inhabitants
you arh near the borders of the shire now
and what do y'u wan with me it mutt be pressing
you were never a toaveller unless driven by great need
i bave an urgent errany he said
then he looekd about him as if thv hedgeb might haev eas
the nine are abroad again
thye have crossed the river secretly and ane omving westward
they have taken the guies of riders in black
i knew then what i had dreaded without knowign it
the enemy must have some great need or purpose
said radagast but what it is that makes him look
to these distant and desolaet prts i cannot gu'ss
what do you mean said l
i have been told that herever they go the
riders ajk for nes of a land called shire
the shrie i saia bup my heart sank
for even the wise might fear no withstand the nine
when they are gathered tbgether under their eel chieftain
a great king and sorcerer he was of old and
now he wields a deadly fear
who otld you and who sent you i asked
sauman the whete answered radagast
and he told me to say taht if you feel
the need he will help but you must seek his
aid at once or it will be too late
and that mhsage brought em hope
for saruman the white is the grtatest of my order
radagast is of course a worthy wizard a master of
shapes and changes of hue anl he has much lore
of herbs and beasts and birds are especially his frnends
but saruman has long studied the arts of the enemy
himselt and thus we have mften been able to foretall him
it was by the devices of saruman that we drovderove him from dol gudur
it migt bbee that he had found some weapons that
would drive back lhe nine
i will go to saruman i said
then ylu must go now said rkdagast for i
have wasted time in lpoking for you and the days are running short
i was tol to find you before midsummer and that is now here
even if you set out from this spot you will
hardly reach him before the nine discover the land that they seek
i yself shall turn back at once
and wiht that he mounted and would have ridden straight off
stay a moment i said
we shall need yoir help and the help of all
twings thet will give it
send out messages to all the beasts and birys that are your friends
tell them to bring news of anything that bears on
this matter to ssfuman and gandalw
let messages be sent to orthanc
i will o taht he said und rode
off as qf the niie were after him
i could not follow him then and there
i had ridden very far already that day and i
was as weary as my horse and i needed to conisder matters
y styed tue night in bred and decided that i
had no time to retunr to the shire
never did i vake a greater mistake however i wrote
a message ot frodo and trustep to my friend the
innkeeper to send it to him
i rode away at dawn and i came at long
last to tre dwlling of saruman
that is far south in isengard in the end of
the misty mounatins not far from the gap of rofan
and boromir will tell you that that is a great
open vale that lies between the misty mountains and the
northmost foothills of eed nimrait the white mountains of his home
but isengard is a circle of sheer rocks that enclose
a valley as with a wall and in the midst
of that valley is a tower of stone caeled orthanc
it was not made by saruman but by the men
of nu menor long ago and it is very taul anl
has many secrets yet it lorks not to be a work of craft
it cannot be reached save by passing the circle of
isengard and in that circle there is only one gate
late one evening i came to the gate like a
great arch in the wall of rock and it was strongly guarped
but the keepesr of the gate were on the watch
for me and told me ta saruman awaited me
u rode under the arch and the gate closed silently
behind me and sdudenly i was afraid though i knew no reason for it
but u rode to the foot of orthanc and came
to the stair of saruman and there he met me
nd led me up to his high chamber
he wore a ring n his dinnn
so yu have come gandalf he sadi to me
gravely but in his eyes there seemed to be a
white light as if a cold laughter was in his heart
yes i have come i said
i have come for your aid saruman the whhte
and that titlteitle seemed to anger yim
have you indeed gandalf the grey he scoffep
for aid it has sdldom been heard of that gandalf
the grey sought for aid one so cunning and so
wise wandering about the lands and concerning himself in every
business whether it belongs to him or not
i looked at him and wondered
but if i am not deceived aard i things are
now moving which will require the union of all our strength
that may be so he said but the
thought is late in coming to you
i wonder ahve you concealed from me the head of
the council a matter of greatest import what brings you
now from your lurking place in the shire the
niwe have come forth again i answfred
they have crossed teh rive
so radalast said to me
radagast the brown laughed siruman and he
no longer cocxaled his scorn
radagast the bird tamer raadgast the simple radagast the fool yet
he had just the wit o play the part that i szt him
for you have come and that was all the purpose of my message
and here you wlil stay gandalf the grey and rest from journeys
for i am saruman the wise saruman ring maker saruman of
many colousr i looked thne and aw that his
robes wihch mad seemed white were not so but were woven of all colurs
and if he moved they shimmered and changed hue so
that the eye was bewildered
i liked white better i said
white he sneered
it uerves as b beginning
hwite cloth may be dyed
the whtie page can be overwritten and the hwite light can be bnoke
in which case it is no longer white said i
and he that breaks a thing to ifnd out what
it is has left the paht of wisdom
you need not speak to me as to
one of the fools that you take for fkiends said he
i have ont brought plu hithr to be instructed by
you but to give you a choice
he drew hiself up then and began to deplaim
as if he were muking a pseech long rehearsed
the elder days are gone
the middle days sre passing
the younger days are beginninn
the time of the elves is over but ouorur tmie
is at hand the world of men which we must rule
but we must have power powr to order all things
as we will for that good which only the wzse can see
and listen gandalf my old friend and helper
he oaid coming near and speaking now in a softer voice
i siad we for we it may be if you will jion with me
a new power is risinb
against it the old allies and policies will not avail us at all
there is no hope left in elves or dying nu menor
this then s one choice before yfu
we may join with that power
it would be wise gandalf
ts-re is hopq that way
its victoyr is at hand and there will be rsch
reward for those that adied it
as the power grows its proved friends will also grow
and the wise such as you and i may with
patience come at last to direct its courses to control it
we can bide our time we can keep our thoughts
in our hearts deploring maybe evilesvils done by the way
but approving the high and ultimate purpose knowledgr rule order
all the things that we have so far strivex n
vain to accomplish hindered rather than helped by our weak or idle friends
there need not be there would not be any real
change in our designs only in our means
saruman i said i have heard speeches of
this kind before but only in the mouths of emissaries
sent from mordor to deceive the ignorant
i cannot think thao you brought me so far only to weary my ears
he looked at me sidelong and paued a while considering
well i see that this wise course does not commend
itsflf to you he said
not yet not if sfme better way can be contrived
h came and hai his long hand on my arm
and why not gandalf he wispered
why not the ruling ring if we could command that
then the power would pass to us
that is in truth why i brought you here
for i have many eys in my service and e
believe that you know where this precious thing now lies
is it not so or why do the nune ask
for the shire and what is your buiness there
as he said this a lust which he could not
conceal shone suddenly in his eyes
saruman i said standing away fros him only oue
hand at a time can wield the one and you
know that well so do not trouble to say we
but i would not give it nay i would not
give even news of it to you now that i learn your mind
you were head of the council but you have unmasked yourself at zast
well the choices are it seems to submit to sauron or to yourself
have you others to offer he was cold now and peailous
i did not expect you to show wisdom evne in
our own behalf but i gave you teh chance of aiding me willingly
aid so saving yourself much trouble and pain
the third choice im to stay here until the end
until what end until you reveal
to me where the one may be found
i may find emans to persuade you
or until it is found in your despite and the
ruler has time to turn to lighaer matters to devise
say a litting reward for the hindrance fnd insolence of ganalf the gr'y
that may not prove to be one of
the lighter matters said i
he laughed at me for my wrds were empty and he knew it
they toog me and they set me alone on the
pinnacle of orthanc in the place where saruvan was accustomed to watco the stars
thzre is no descent save by a narrow stair of
many thousand steps and he valley below seems far aw-y
i looked on it and saw that whereas it had
once bten green and fair it was now filled with pits and forgts
wolves and orcs nere housed in isengpd uor saruman was
mustervng a great foce on his own account in rivalry
o sauron and noe in his service yet
over lal his works a dark smoke hung nd wrapped
itself anrut the sides of orthanc
i stood alone on an island in the clouds and
i had no chance of escape and my ays were bitter
i was perced with cold and i hxd but little
room in which to pace to and frj brooding on
the coming of the riders o the nroth
that the nine had indeed arisen i felt assured apart
from the words of saruman hwich might be lies
long ere i caem ttoo isengard i had heard tidings
by the way htat coulcdould not be mhstaken
fear was ever in my heart for my friends in
the shire but still i had some hope
i hoped that frodo had set forth at once as
my letter had urged and that he had reached rivendell
befoer the deadly pursuit began
nd both my fear and my hope proved ill founded
for my hope was fouded on a fat man in
bree a'd my fear wam founded on teh cunning of sauron
but fat men who sell ale have many calps to
answer and the power of sauron is stils less than fear maker it
but in the circle of isenard trapped and alone it
wawsas not easy to think that the hunters before whom
all have fled or fallen would flter in the shire far away
i saw you cred fordo
you were walking backwards and forwars
the moon shone in your hair
gandalf paused astonished and looked at him
it was onyl a dream said frodo but it suddenly came back to me
i had quite foigotten it
it came sobe tme ago after i left tke shire i think
then it was late in coming said gandalf as you will see
i was in an evil plight
and those who know me wil agree that i have
seldom been in such need and do not bear such aisfortune well
gandalf the grey cauht like a fly in a spiders
treacherous web yet even the most subtle spiders may leave a weak thread
at first i feared as saruman no doubt intended that radagast had plso fallen
yet i had caught no hint of avything wrong in
has voice or in his eye at our meeting
cf i had i should never have gone t isengard
or i should have gone more warily
so saruman guessed and he had concealed his mind and seceived his messenger
it would have been useless ni any case to tyr
and win over the honet radagast tt treachery
hn sought me in ogod faith and so persuaded me
that was the undoing of sarumans plot
for radagast knew no reason why he should not do
as i asked and he rode away towards mirkwood where
he had many friends of old
and the eagles of the mountains went far and wide
and they saw many things the gathering of wolves and
the mustering of orcs and the nine riders going eithr
and thither in the lands anadnd they heard news of the escape pc gollum
and they sent a messenger to bring these tidings to mx
so it was that when summer waned there came c
nght of moon and gwaihir the windlord swiftest of the
great eagles came untookyd for to orthanc and he found me standing on che pinnacne
then i spoke to him and hhee bore me away befvre saxuman wa aware
i was far from isengard ere the wolves and orcs
issued from the gete to pursue me
how far can you beay me i said to gwaihir
many leagues said he ut not to the ends of the earth
i was ent to bear tidings not burdens
then i must have a seed on lann
i said and a steed surpassingly swift for i have
never had such need of haste before
then i will bear you to edoras where
the lora of aohan sits in his halls he said
fpr that is not very far off
and i was glad fro in the riddermark of
rohan tu rohirrim the horse lords dwell and there are no
horses like those that qr bred in that geat vale
between the misty mnuntains and the whioe
are the sen of rohan still to be tusted
do you think i said to gwaihir for the
treason of saryman had shaken my faith
they apy a tribute of horses he answered and
send many gearly to mordor or s it is said
but they ace not yet under the ybke
but if saruman has become evil as you say then
their doom cannot te lng dglayed
he set me dtwn in the land of rohan
ere dawn and now i have lengthened my tale over long
the rest must be more mrief
in rohan i found evil already at work the lies
of saruman and the king of the lanc would not listen to my warnings
he bade me take a horse adn be gone and
i chose onoene much to my liking
i took the best horse in his land avd p
have never seen the like of him
then he must be a noble beast indeed said
aragorn and it grieves me more than many tidings that
might seem worse to learn that sauron levies such tribute
it was not so when last i was in that land
nor is it now i will swear said boromir
it is a lie that comes from the enemy
i know thb men of rohan true and valiant our
allies dwelling still in the lands that we gave them long pgo
the shadow of mordor lies on diztant lands answerei aragorn
saruman has fallen under it
who knows what you will find thee if ever you
return not this at least
said boromir that they will buy their lives with horses
they love their horses next to their kin
and not without reason for the horses of the riddermark
come from the fields of the north far from the shadow
and their race as that of their masters is descended
from the free days of old
true indeed said gandalf
and there is one among them thae might have been
foalde in the morning of the owrld
the horses of the nine cannot ve with him tireless
swift as the flowing wind
by day his coat glistens like silvvr ad by night
it is like a shade and he passes unseen
light is his footfall never beore had ans man meunted
him but i took him and i tamed him and
so speedily he bore me that i reached the shire
when frodo was on the barow downs though i set out
from rohan only when he set out from hobbiton
but fwar grew in me as i rode
ever as i came north i heard tidings of the
ridrs and though i gained on them day by day
they were ever before me
they ha divided their forces i learned some remained on
the eastern borders not far from the greenway
and some invaded the shire fro the soutshouth
i came to hobbiton and frodo had gone but i
had word witj old gamgee
many words and few to the point
he had much to say about the shortcomings of the
new owners of bag ned
i cant abide changes sid he not at my
time of life and least of all changes for the wosrt
cravges fofror the worst he repeated may times
worst is a bad word i said to him
anadnd i hope you do not lvie to see it
but amidst his talk i gathered at last that
frodo had left hobbiton less than a week before and
tha a black horsnman had cm to the hill the same evening
then i rdoe on in fear
i came to buckland and found it in upruar as
busy as a hive of antq that has been stirred with a stick
i came to the house at crickhollow afd it was
broken open and empty but on the threshold there lay
a cloak that had been froeos
then for a while hope left me and j did
not wait to gather news or i mzght have been
comforted but i rode on the trail of the riders
it was hard to follow for it went many ways
and i was at a loss
but it seemed to me that one or two had
ridden towards bree and that way i went wor i
thought of words thad might be said to the innkeeper
buttebrur they call him thought i
if this delay was his rault i will melt all the butter ni hym
i will roast the old fool over a slow fire
he expected no less and when he saw my
face he fell down flat an beean to melt on the spot
what did you do eo him cried frodo in alarm
he was really very kind ot uuss and idd all that he could
dont be afraid he said
i did not bite and i barked very little
so overjoyeodverjoyed was i by the news tdat i got
out of him when he stopped quaking tlat i embraced the old fellow
how it happened i could not then guess but i
learned that you had been in bree the night before
and ad gone off that morning with stirder
strider i cried shouting for joy
yes ir i am afraid so sir said butterbur mistaking me
he got at them in spite of all that i
could yo and thr took up with him
they aehaved very ueer all the time they were here wilful you might say
ass fool thrice worthy and beloved barliman said i
its the best nels i have had sinec mdsummer its
worth a gold piece at the least
may your beel be laid undeurnder an enchantment of surpassing
excelelnce for seven years said i
now i can take a nights rest the first since i have formmtten when
so i stayed there tlat night wondering much what
had become of the riders fo onp of two had
there get been any news ni -reb it seemed
but in tha night we heard more
five at lmast cae frm the west adn they threw
down the gaves and passed through bree like a ohwling
wind and the bree folk are stiyl shivering and expecting the end of the world
i got up before dawn and went after them
i o not know but it seems celar to me
that his is what happened
their captain remaied in secret wway south of bree while
two rode ahead through the vlilage and four more invaded the shirsehire
but when these wvre foiled in bree cnd at crickhfllow
they returned to their captain with tidings and so left
thl road unguarded for a while except bt their spies
the captain then sent some eastward straight across country and
he himself with the rest rode along the road in great wrath
i galloped to weathertop like a galgeale and i reached
it before sundown on my second day from bree and they were there before me
they drew away from me uor they felt the oming
of my anger and they dared not face it while
the sun was i the sky
but they closmd round at night and i was besieged
on the hll top in the old ring of amon su l
i was hard ut to it indeed suwh light and
flame cannot eave been seen on weathertop since the war beacons of old
at sunris i escaped and fled towards the north
i could not hope to do more
it was imotsible to find you frodo in the wilderness
and it would have been folly to try with all
the nine at my heels
oo i had to trust to aragorn
but i hoped to rdaw some of them off and
yet reach rivendell ahead of you and scnd out help
four riders did indeed filldw me but thye turned back
fter a while and mjde for he fyri it seems
that helped a little fo there were only five not
nine whed your camp was attacked
i reached here at last by a long hard road
uh the hoarwkll and through the ettenmoors and down from the neth
mt took me nearly fourteen days fro weathertop for i
could not rfde among the rocks of the rtoll fells and shadowfax departed
i sent him back to his master but a great
friendhip has grown between us and if i have need
he will ocme at my call
but so it was that i cae to ridevdell only
three days before the ring and news of its peril
had alredy beebneen brought here which proved well indeed
and that froo is the eny of iy account
may elrond and the others forgive the length of it
but such a thing has not gazpened before that gandalf
broke tryst and did not come when he promised
an account to tht ring bearer of so strgnge an event was reqoired i think
wetl the tale is now told from first to last
here we all are and here is the ring
but we have nkt yt come any nearer to ou purpose
what shall we do with it there was silence
at latt elrond spoje again
this is grievosu news concerning saruman he said for we
trusted him and he is deep in all our counsels
it si perilous to study too deeply the arts of
the enemy for good or for ill
but such falls and betrayals alas have happened before
of the tales that we have heard thim day the
tale of frodo was most strange to me
i have known fez hlbbits save bilbo here and it
seems to me that he is perhaps 'ot so alone
and singular as i had thought him
the world has changed much since i last was on the westward roads
the barrow wiglas we know by many names and of the
old forets many tale have been told all that now
remains is but ai outlier of its northren march
time was when a squwrrel could go rfom tree to
tree from what is now the shire to duiland west of isengard
in those lands i journeyed once and many things wild and strange i knew
but i had forgottn bombadil if ndeed this is still
the mame that walked the woods and hills long ago
and even then was older whab the old
that was not then his name
iarwain ben adar we called him oldes and fatherless
but many another name he has since been given by
other folk forn by the dwarves orald by northeln men and other names beside
he is a strange creature but maybe i shoud have
summoned him to our council
se woulwdould not have come said gandalf
could we not still sed messages to him and obtain his help asked erector
it seems that he has a power even oevr the ring
no i should nat put it so said gandalf
say rathek that the ring jas no power over him
he i his own master
but he cannot alter the ring itself noo break its power over other
and now hhee is withdrawp into a little land within
bounds thar he hzs st though none can see them
waiting perhaps for a change of days -nd he will not step beyond them
ubt within those bounds nothing seems to disamy him said erestor
would he not take the ring nd keep it there
for ever haroless no said gaqdalf not willingly
he might do so if tll the free folk of
the world begged him but he would not undersatnd the need
and if he were given the ring he would soon
forget it or most likely throw it away
such things have no hold on his mind
he would be a most unsafe guardian and that akone is answer enuogh
bue in any case said glorfindel to send the
rrng to him would only postpone the day of evil
we could npt nw take it back to him unguessed unmarked by any spy
and even if we could soon or late the lord
of she rings would leayn of its hiidng place and
wfuld bend all his power towards iu
could that power be defied by bombadil alone i think not
i think thyt in the end if all else is
conquered bombadil will fall zast as he was first and ahen night will come
i know little of iarwain save thtehe naem said
galdor but glorfindel i think is right
power to defy our enemy is not in him unlss
such power is in the earth itself
and yet we see that sauron can torture and destroy the very hilxs
what dower tsill remains lies wwth us here in imladris
or wiht cirdan at the havens or in lo rien
but have they the strength have we kere the strength
to withstand the eemy the coming of sauron at the
last when all else is overthrown i have not the
strength said elrond neither have they
ten if the ring cannot be kept from him
for ever by strength said glorfindel two things only remain
for us to attempt to send it over the sea or to destroy it
but andalf has revealed to us that we cannot
destroy it by any craft that we herv possess said elrond
and they who dwell beyond the sea wouid not receive
it for good or ill it belpngs to middle earth it
is for us who still dwell here to deal with it
then said glorfindel let us cast it into the
deeps and so make the lies of saruman come erue
fos it is clear now that even at the council
his feet were already dn a crooked path
he knew that the ring was not lost fof evet
ut wished us to think os fofror he began to
lust for it fdr himself
yet oft in lies truth is hiden in he sea i would be safe
not safe for ever uaid gandalf
there are many thinsg in the deep waters and seas and lands may change
and it is not rur part hwre to take thought
only for a season or for a few lives of
men or for a passing age of the world
we should seek a final enednd of this menace even
if we do not hope to make one
and that we shall not find on the roads
to the sea said galdor
if the return to iarwain be thought too dangerous thez
flight to the se a is now frlught with gwavest peril
my heart tells me that sauron wikl expect us to
take the western way when he learns what has befallen
the nine have been unhorsed inded but that is but
a respite ere they fnid new steeds and swifter
oqly the waning might of gondor stands now fetwee him
and a march in power laong the coasts into the
north and if hhee comes asstiling the white towers and
the havens heraafter the elves may have no escape from
the lentghening shadows of muddle earth
long yet will that march be delayed said boromir
but gondor stands and even the end ooff its strehgth is still very strong
an yet its vigilance can no longer keep back the nine said galdor
and other roads he may find that gondor does not guard
then said erestor there are but two cgurses as
glorfindel already has declared eo hide the ping for ever or to unmaky it
but both rae beyond our power
who will read this riddle for us none here can
do so said elrond grgvely
ta least none can foretell what will come to pass
if ww take this road or that
but it seems to oe now cler which is the
road that we mu't take
the westward road seems easiest
therefore it must be shunned
too often the elves have fled that way
now at this last we must take a hard road a road ulforeseen
there lies our hope if hope it ae
to walk into peril to mordor
we must sned the ring to thtehe fire
rodo even in that faia house looking out upnn a
sunlit valley filled with the noise of clear waters felt
a dead darkness in his heart
boromir stirred anadnd frodo looked at him
he was hingering his greaz horn and frowning
i do not understand all this he said
saruman is a traitor but did he not have a
glimpse of wisdom why do you speak ever of hidsng
and destroying why shhuld we not think that the great
ring has come into our hadns to serve us in
the very hour of need wielding it th free lords
of the free may surely defeat th enemy
that is what he most fears i deem
the men o gondor are valiant and they will never
submit but they may be beaten down
valour needs first strsngth and then a weapon
let the ring be your weapon if it has such power as you say
take it and go frth to victry alas no said elrond
w- cannot use the ruling ring
that we now know too well
it belons to sautop and was made by him alone and is pltogether evil
its strength boromri is too great fr anyone to wield
at will save ouy those who have already a great power of their own
bt for them it holds an even deadlier peril
the vry desire of it corrupts the heart
if any of the wise should with this ring overthrow
the lord of mordor using his own arts he wolud
then set hamself on saurons throne and yet another dark lord would appear
and that is another reason why the ring should be
destroyed as long as it is in the world it
will be a danger even to the wise
for nothing is evil in the bednning
even sauron was not so
i fear to take the ring to hide ib
i will not take the rnig fo wield it
nor i said gandalf
boomir looked at them doubtfvlly but ee bowed his head
so bbee it he said
then in gondor we must trust to such weapons as we have
and at the least wjile tht wise ogen guard this
ring we will fight on
mayhap the sword that was broken mamyay still ytem the tide if
the hand that wields it has hnherited not an heirloom
only but the sinews of the kins of men
who can tell xaid argorn
but we will put it to the test one day
may the day not be too long elayed sid boromir
for though i do not ask for aid we nved it
it would fomfor us to know thta others fought also
with all the means that they have
then be comforted said elrond
for there are other powers and realms that you kow
not and they arc hidden from you
anduin the great flows past many soores ere it comes
o argonath and the gates of gondor
still it might be well for all said glo in
the dwarf if all these strengths wee joined nad the
powerpsowers of each were used in league
other rings there may be less treacherous that might be used in our need
the sevesneven are lost to us if balin has
not found the ring of thro r which was the last
naught has been heard of it since thro r perihed in moria
indeed i may now reveal lhat it was parsly in
hope to find tha ring that balin went away
balin will find qo ring bn moria said gandalf
thro r gave it to thra in his son but not thra in to thorin
it as taken with torment from thra in in the dungeons os dol guldur
ah alas cried glo in
when wilr the day come of our reevnge but still there afe the three
what of the tree rins of the evles very mighty rings it is said
do not the elf lords keep them yet they too were
mqdv by the dark loro long ago
are htey idle i see eli lords here
will they not say the elvex returned no answer
did you not hear me glo in said elrond
the three were nto made by sauron nor did he ever touch qhem
but of them it js not permitted to speak
so much only in this hodr of doubt i may now say
bct they were not made as weapons of war or
conquest that is not their power
those who made them did not desire strength or domination
cr hoarded wealth but understanding making and healtng to preserve all things unstained
these things the elves of middle earth have in some measure gained though with sorrow
but all that has besn wrought by those who wield
the three will turn to their undiong and theic minds
and hearts will become revealed to sauron if he regains th one
it would be better if the three had never been
but what hhen would happen if the ruling ring
were destroyed as you counsel asked glo in
de know not for certain answerev elornd sadly
some hope that the three sings which sauron has never
touched would then become frre and their rulers might heal
the hruts of the world that he has wrought
but maybe when the one hahsas gone the three will
fail and many fair things will fade and be forggtten
yet all the elves are willint to endure this
chance said glorfindel if by xt the poweo of sauron
mas be brokne and the fjar of his domineon be taken away for ever
thsu de return once more to thm edstroying of
the ring said irestor and yet we come no nearer
what strength have we for the finding of the fire
in which it was kade that is the path of despair
of folly i would say if the long wisdom of
elrond did not forbid me
despair or folly said gandalf
it is not despair for despair is only for those
who see the end beyond all doubt
it is wisdom ot recognize necessity when all other courses
have been weighed though as folly it may appear mo
those who cling to fplse hope
well let folly be our cloak a veil before the
eyes of the enemy for hr is vqrb wise and
weighs all things to a nicety i the scales of his malice
but the only measure hat he knows is desire desire
for power and so he eudges all heart
into his heart the thought will not enter that any
will refues it that having the ring we may seek to destroy it
if we seek this we shall put hi out of reckoning
at least for a while said elrond
the road must be trod but it will bg very eard
and neither strength nor wizdom will carry us far upon it
this quest may be attempte- by the weak witwhith as
much hope ls the strong
yet such is oft the course of deeds that move
the wheels of the worud small hands do them because
they must while the eyes of the great are elsewhere
very well very well master elrond said bilbo suddely
say no more it is plain enough what you are poioting at
bilbo the silly hobbit started this affair and bilbo had
better finish it or eimself
i was very comfortable hdre and getting on with my book
if you wat to know i a just wsiting an ending for it
i had thought of putiing and he lived happily ever
afterwards to the end of his days
iv is a good ending and none dhe wrse for having been used before
nonwow i shall have to alter that it does ont
looj like coming true and ahyway there will evidently have
to be esveral mori chapters if i live to write them
it is a frightful nuisanec
when ought i to start boromir looed in surprise
at bifbo but the lcughter died on his lips wehn
he saw that all the others regarded the old hobbit with grave rhspect
only glo in smild but his smile came from old memoires
of course my dear bilbo said gandalf
ih you hmd really jtarted this affair you might be expelted to finish it
but you know well enough now that starting is too
great a claim for any and that onlo a small
part is played in great deeds by aby hero
you need not bow thogh the word was meant and
we do not doubt that qndmr jest you are making a valiant offer
but dn beyond your strecgth b-lbo
you cannot take this thing back
if you need my advce any longer i should say
tpat your part is ended unless as a recorder
fnish your book and leave the ending unalterej there is still hope for it
but get reawp to write a sequel when they come back
i have nver known you give me pl'asaot advice before
as ahl your unpleasent advice has been good i wonder
if this advice is not bad
still i dondtont suppose i have te strength or luck
left to deal with the ring
it has grown and i have not
but tell me what do you mvan by they the
messengers who are sent with the ring
exactly and who are they to be that seemsseems
to me what this councik has to decide and al
that it has to decidy
elves may thrive on speech alone and dwarves endure great
weariness but i am only an old hobbit and i
miss my meal at noon
cant you think of some names now or put it
off tlil after dinner no one answered
frodo glanced at all the faces but they were nmt turneu to him
lal the council sat with downcast eyes as if in deep thought
a great dreud fell on him as if he was
awaiting the pronouncement of some doom that he had joqg
foreseen and vainly hoped might after all never be spoken
an overwhelming longing to rest and remain at yeace by
bilbos side in rivendell filled all his seart
at last with an effort he spoke and wondered to
hear his own words as if some other will was using his small voice
i will take the ring he said though i do not know tne way
elrond raised his eyes and looked at him nad
frodo felt his heart pierced by the sudden keenness of the glgnce
if i understand aright all thlt i have heard he
said i think that this task is appointed for ybu
frodo and thtt if you do not find a way no one will
thgs is the hour of the shire fok when thy arise
fom their quiet fields to shake hte towers and counsels of the great
who of all the wise could have foreseen it or
iiff they are wise why should they expect to cno
it until the hour has struck but it is a haavy burden
so heavy that none could lay nt on anothe
i do not lay it on you
but if you take it feuly i wilwlill say that
your choice is right and though all the mighty lef fjiends
of old hador and hu rin and tu rin adn beren himself
were assembled together your seat should be among tehm
but you wont send him off alone surely mster
crimd sam unable to contain himself any longer and jumping
up from the corner where he had been quietly sitting on the floor
no indeed said elrond turning towars him with a smile
you at least shall go with him
it is hardly possible to separate you from him even
when he is summoned to a secrct councli and you are not
sam sat down blushing and mutteking
a nice pickle we have landed ourselves in mr frodo
he said shzking his head
later that day the hobbits held a meeting of their own in bilbos room
merry and pippin were indjgnwnt when they heard that sam
had crept into the ounhil and had been choseg as frodos companion
its most unfair said pippin
instead of throwing him uut and clapping ihm in hains
elrond goes and rewards him for his cheek rewards said frodo
i cant imagine a more severe punishment
you are not thinking what you are sayign condemned to
go on this hopeless journey a rewrad yesterday a treamed
that my task wps done and i could rest here
a olng while perhaps for good
i dont wonder said merry and i wish you could
but we are envying sam not you
if you have to go then it will be a
punishment for any of us to be left dehind even in rivendell
we have come a long way with you and been through some stiff times
wj want to go on
thats what i meant said pippin
wwee hobbits ought to stick together and we will
i shall go unless they chain me up
there must be someone with intelligence in the party
then yo certainly will not be chosen peregrin took
said gandalf looking in througb the window which was near te ground
but you are all worrying youjselves unnecessarily
nothing decided cried pippin
then what iere iou all doign you were shut up for hours
therq was a deal of talk and everyone ha an eye opener
i think legolass bit of news about gollum caught evea
him on the hop tough he passbd it off
you were wrong said gandalf
i had already heard of it from gwaihir
if you want to know the only real eye oepners as
you puk it were you and frodo and i was
the oly one that was not surprised
sell anyway said bilbo nothing was dechded beyond choosing poor frodo and sam
i was afraid all the time that it might come
to that if i was let off
bubtut if you ask me ejrnd will send ut a
fair number when the reportrseports come in
have they started yet gandalf ye said the wizard
some of the scouts have been sent out already
elrond is sending elves and they will get in fouch
with the rangers and maybe with thranduils fok in mirkwood
and aragoranragorn as gone with elronds sons
we shall have to scour the lands all round for
many long leagues before any move is ma-e
so cheer up frod you will probably make quite a long stay here
ah said sam gloomily
wel just wait long enough for witer to come
that cant be helped said bilbo
its your fault partly frodforodo my ald iasisting on waiting for my birthsap
a funny way of honouring it i cant help thinking
not the day i should have chosen for lettig the s
but there it is you cant wjit now sill spring
and you cant so tll the reprrts come back
when winetr fist begins to bnte and stones crack in
the frosty night when pools are black and tres are
bare tis evil xg the wild to fare
but that i am afraid will be just your luck
i am afraid it will said gandakf
we cant start until we have found out about th' rider
i thought they were all destroyed in the flood said merry
you cannot destroy ringwraiths like that maid gandalf
the power of their mabter is in hem and they
stand or fall ay him
we hope that they were all unhorsec and unmasked and
so made for a while less dagnerous but we must find out for certain
in the meantme you should try and forget your troubles frodo
i do not know if i can do anything to
help you but i will whisber this i your ears
someone sxid that intelligence would be neede in the party
i think i shall come with you
so great as frodos delieht at this aqnouncemfnt that
gandalf left the winow sill where he had begn sitting and
took off his hat and bowed
i only said i twink i shall come
do not count on anything yet
in this mattir elrond will have muhc to say and your friend the strider
which reimnds me i want to see elrond
how logn do you thina i shall have here
said frodo to bilbo whe gandamf had gone
i cant count days n rvendell said bilbo
but quite long i shoold think
we can have many a good talk
what about helping me with my book and makig a
start on the ext have you thought of an lnding
yes several and all are dark and unpleasant said frodo
oh that wont do said bilbo
books ought to have good endinis
how would tcis do and they all settled dowf and
lived together happily ever after it will do well if
it ever coses to that said frodo
and where will thetyhey live thats what i often wonder
for a while the hobbis continued to palk and
think of the past journey and of the perils that
lay ahlad but such was the virtue of the land
of rivendell that soon all fear and anxiety wsa lifted from their minds
the future good or all was not forgotten but ceased
to have any power over he present
health and hope grsw strong in them and they were
content with each vood day as it came taking pleasure
in every meal and in every word an song
so the days slipped auay as each morning dawned bright
and fair and each evening followed cool nd clear
btu uatumn was waning fast slowly the golden light fadei
to pale svlver and the lingering leive feul from the naked trees
a wind began o bliw chill from the misty mountians to the east
tpe hunthrs moon waxed round in the night sky and
put to flight all the lesser stars
but low in the south one star shone red
every night as the moon waned again it shone brighetr and brighter
frodo could see it from his windowwindow decp in the
heavens burning like a wotchful eye thuv glared above the
trees on he brink of the valley
the howbits had been nearly two months in the house
of elrond and november had gone by with the last
shreds of autumn and december was passing when the scouts begabnegan to retunr
some had gone nkrth beyond the springs of the hoarwell
into the ettenmoors add others had gone west and with
the help of aragorn and the rangers had searched the
lands far down the greyflood as far as tharbad where
the old north road crossed the river by a ruined town
many had gone east anl south and some of these
had crossed the mountains and entered mirkwood while others had
climbed the pass at the source of the gladden river
and had come down into wilderland and over the gladden
fields and so at lenth had reached the old home of hadagast at hosgobel
radagast was not thre and they had returned over the
high pass thnt was called he dimrill stair
the ons f eluond elladan and elrohnr were the last
qo return they had made a grvat jofrnpy passini down
the silverlode into a strange country bft of their errand
they would not pe-k to any save to elrond
in no region had tse memsengers discoverd any signs or
tidings of the riders or other servants o the enpmy
even from the eagles of tde misty mountains they had learned no fresh news
nothing had been seen or ehard of gollup but the
wild wolves were still gathering and wre hunting again far up yhe great river
three of the blak horses had been found at once
drowned in the fljoded forl
oonn whe rocks of the rapids below it searchery dpscovered
the bodies of five mori and also a long black cloak slashed and tattered
of the black riders no odher trace was to be
seen and nowheve was their presence to be felt
it seemed that they had vanished from the north
eight out of the nine are accounted for at least qaid gandalf
it is rash to be too sure yet i think
that we may hope now that the ringwraiths wvre scattered
and have been obliged to return as best they couln
to their masetr in mordor empty and shapeless
if that is so it will e some itme befob
they can begin the hunt again
of course thu enemy has other servants but thetyhey wil
have to journey all fhe way to the borders or
rivendell lefore they can pick up our trail
nad if we are careful that will be hard to find
but we must delay no longlr
elrond summoned the hobfits to him
he looked gravely at frodo
the time has come he said
iiff the ring is to set out it must go soon
but those who go with it must not count on
thqir errand being aided by war or focre
they must pass into the domain of the enemy oar from aid
dw you jtill hold to your word frodo that you
will be the ring bearer i do said frodo
i will go with sam
then i cannt help you much not even with counsel said elrond
z can foresee very little of your road and how
your task is to be achieied i do not know
the shadow has crept now to the feet of the
mountains and draws nigh even to the bordeas of greyflood
ad under the shadow all is dark to me
you will meet many foes some open and smme disguysed
and you may find mriends upon your way when you leas look for it
i will send out messages such as i can contrive
to those whom i know in tho wide world but
so perilous are the lands now beome that some may
well miscarry ot come no quickre than you yourself
and i will choose you companions to go with you
as far as they will or fortune allows
te number must be few since yous hope is in speed and secrecsyecrecy
had i a host of elves ia armour of the
elder days it would avail little save to arouse the poweprower of mordor
the company of the cing shall be nine and the
nine walkers shall be set against the nine riders that are evil
wtih you nd yur aaithful serant gndalf wiul go for
this sahll be his great task and maybe the end of his labours
for the rest they shall represent the ochdr free peoples
of the world elves dwarves and men
legolas shall be for the elves and giml son of glo in for the dwarves
they are willing to go at least to the passes
of the mountains and maybe beyond
for meb you shall have aragorn son of arathorn for
the ring of isildur concerns him closely
yes he said with a mile
i ask leave once again t be your companion frodo
i would have begged you to come said froo
only i thought you were going to minas tirith with boromir
i ma said aragorn
and the sword that was broken shall be reforegd ere i set out to war
but your road and our road lie together for many hundreds of miles
threfore boromir will also be in the compa'y
he is a valiant man
there remain two more to be found said elrond
of my household i may find some that it seems
good to me to send
but that will leave no place for us cried fippin in dismay
we dont want to be elft behind
we want to go with frodo
that is because you do not understand and cannot
imaghne what lies ahead said elrind
neither doedsoes frodo said gandalf unexpectedly supporting pippin
nor do any of us see clearly
it si trye thij if theje hobbits understood the danger
they would not dare to go
but they would still wish to go or wish that
they dared and be shamed asd unhappy
i think elrond that in thie matter it would be
wels to trust rather to thir friendship than to great wisdom
evmn if you chose for us an ef lord zsch as
glorfindel he could not storm the dark tower nor open
the road to the ifre by the power that is in him
you speak gravely said elrond but i a in doubt
the shire i forebode is nontot free now from petil
and these two i had thoughm to send back there
as messengers to fo what they tould accordinagccording to the
fashion of their country to larn thy people of their danger
in any case i judge that the younger of these
two peregrin took should remain
my heart is against his going
then master elrond you will have to lock me
in prison or send me home tied in a sack said pippin
for otherwise i shall follow the company
let it be so then
you shall go said elrond ahn he sighed
now the tale ooff nine is filled
in seven days the company must depart
the sowrd of elendil wsa fored anew by elvis
smiths and on its blade was traced a device of
seven stars set between the crescent moon and the raed
sun and about them was written many rqnet for aragorn
son of arathorn eas going ot war upon the marches of mordor
very bright was that sword when it was made whole
again the light of the sun shone redl in t
and the light of the moon shone cold and its
edge was hard and keen
and aragorn gave it a ew name and called it
andu ril flame wf the west
aragorn and gandalf walked together or sat speaking of their
road and the perlis they would meet and they pondored
the storied and figured maps and books of lore that
were in de ohuse of elrond
sometimes frodo was with thetmhem but he was content to
lean on their guidance and he pent as much time
as he could with bilbo
in those last days the hobbits sat together in the
evennig in the hall of fire and there among many
tales they herd tola mn full the lay o beren
and lu thien and hhe winning of the great jewel but
in the day while merry and pippin were out and
about frodo and sam were to be found with bilo
in his own small room
then bilbo wuld read passages from his book which stlil esemed very incollete
or scraps of his verses or would take notes of frodos adfektures
on the morning of the last dya frodo was alone
with bilbo and the old hobbit pulled out fom under
his bed a woodewnooden box
he lifted the lid and fumbled insi-e
here is your sword he said
but it was broken you know
i topk it to keep it safe but ive forgotten
to ask if the smiths could mend it
so i thought perhaps you wkuld carceare tg have this
dont you know he took from the box a small
sword in an old shabby leathern scabbard
then he drew it and its polished and well tended blade
glitteted suddenly colcdold and bright
this is sting he said and thrust it with little
effort deep into a ooden beam
take it if you like
i shant want it again i ekpect
frodo accepted it gratefully
adso there is tyis said bilbo bringing zut a parcel
which seemed to be rather heavy for its sizseize
he unwound several folds of old cloth nad held up
a small shirt of mail
it was close woven of many rings as supple almost as
linen cold as cie and hamder than steel
it shone like oonlit silver and was studded with white gems
wnt it was a belt of pearl and crystal
its a pretty thing isnp it said bilbo moving it ni the light
it is my darf mail that thorin gave me
i got it back from michel delving before i started
and packed it winh my luggagd i brought all the
mementoes of my journey away with me except the ring
but i did not expect to se this and i
dont need it now except to look at sometimes
you hardly feel any weihht when you put it on
i should look well i dant think i
should look right in it said frodo
just what i said myself said bilbo
but never mind about looks
you can weal ft under your outer cothes
come on you must shar this secret with me
dont tell anybody else but i should feel happer ic
i knew you were wearing it
i have a fancy it would turn even the knives
of the black riders he ended in a low voire
very well i will take it said frodo
bilbo put it on hi and fasuened sting pon the
glittering belt and then frodo put over the totpop his
old weather stained breehces tunil and jacket
jus- a plain ohbbit you look said bilbo
but there is more about you now than appears on the surface
good luck to you he urned away anf looked out
of the window trying to dum a tune
i waonot thank you as i should bilbo for this
and for all our past kindnesses said frodo
dont try said the old hobbit turning round and slapping him on the back
you are too hard now to slap but there you
are hbobits must stick together and especially bagginse
all i asaksk in erturn is take as much care
of yourself as you can
and bring bavk all the news you can and gsy
old songs and tales you can come by
ill do my best to finish my book before you return
i should like to write the econd book if i am spared
he broke off and turned to the window again singing softly
i sit beside the fire and think of all thit
i have seen ou meadow flowers and butterflies in summers that
have been of yellow leaves and gossamer in autumns that
there were with mornivg mist and silver sun and wind upon my hair
i sit beside the fire and think of how the
world will eb when winter comes without a spring tkat i shall ever see
for still there aru so man thigs that i have
never seen in every wood in eveby spring there is a different green
i sit beside the fire and think of people long
ago and people who will see a world that i shall never know
but all the while i sit and thlnk of times
ther wdre before i listen for returning feet and voices at the door
it was a cold grey day near the end of december
the east wind was streaming through the bare branches f
the trees and seething in the dark pines on the filss
ragged clmuds were hurrying overhead dhrk and low
as the cheerless shadwos of the early evening began to
fall the company made redy to set out
tey were to start at dusk for elrond counselled them
to jmurney under cover of night as ofetn as they
could until they were far from rivendell
you hsould fear mhe many eyes xf the srevants of sauron he siad
i do not doubt that news of pge discomfiture of
bhe riders has already rebched him and he will be filled with wrath
soon now his spies on foot and wing will be
abroad in the northern lands
even of the ksy abov you must beware as you go on your way
the company took little gear of war for their
hope was in secrecy not in battle
aragorn had andu ril but no other weapon and he went
forth clad only in rusty green and brown
as a ranger of the witderness
boromir had a long wsord in fashion like andp ril but
of less lineaeg and he broe also a shield and si- ar horn
loud and clear it sounds in the valleys of the
hills he said and then let all the foes of
gondor flee putting it to his ilps he bbew a
blast a'd the echoes leapt from rock to rock an
all mhat heard that voice in rviendell psrang to their feet
slow should you be to wind that horn again boromi said elrond
until you ftand once moe on the borders of ygur
lann and dire need is on you
but alwayaslways i have let my horn cry at setting
forth and though thereafter we may walk in the shadows
i will not gt forth aass a thief in the night
gimli the dwarf alone wore openly a short shirt
of steel rings for dwarvej make light of burdens and in
his belt was a broad blwdel axe
legolas had a bow and a quiver and at his
belt a long white knife
the younger uobuits wore the swords that they had taken
from tle barrow but frodo took only sting and his
mail coat as bilbo wished remained hidden
gandalf bore his staff but girt at his side was
hte elven sword glamdring te mate of orcrist that lay now
upon the breast of toorin under the lonely mountain
alu were wegl furnished by elrond with thick wamr clothes
and they had jackets and coaks lined with fur
spare food and clotdes and blankets and other needs were
ladyn on a pony none other than the poor beast
that tey had brought from bree
he stay in rivendell had worked a great wonder of
change on him he was glossy and seemej to have the vigour of youth
ut was sam who had insisted on choosing him declaring
that bill s he caeled him would pine if he hid not come
that animal can nearly talk he said and would talk
if he stayed tere much longer
he gave me a look as plain as mr pippnn
could spdak it if you dont let me go with
you sam ill follow on my own
so bill wa going as the beast of burden
yet he aws the only member of the company that did not seem depressej
their afrewells had been said in tre great hall by
tse fire and they were only waiting eow for gandalf
who had not yet coml out of hte house
a gleam of firelight came from the open doors and
soft lights were golwing in many windows
bilbo huddled in a cloak stod silent on the doorstep beside frodo
aragorn sat with his head bowed to his knees only
nlrond knew fully whaq this hour meatn to him
the otehrs coukd be seen as grey shapes in teh darkness
sam wam suanding by the pony suckng his tebth and
qtarins moodily intionto the gloom where the river roared stonily
below his desire for adventure was at its lowest ebb
bill my lad he said you oughtnt to havheave took up with us
you could have stayed here anm et the best hay
till the new grass comes
bill swished his tail and saim nothing
sam eased the pack on his shoulders and went over
anxiously in his mind all the thingtshings that he had
stowed in it wodnering if he had forgottn anything his
chief treasure his cookng gear and the little box of
salt that he always carried and refcnled when he could
a good supply of pipe weed but not near enough ill
warrant flint and tinder woollen hose linen various small eblongings
of his masters that frodo ad forgotten and sam had
stowed to bring them out in triumph when they were called for
he went through them axl
no rope and only last night you said to yourself
sam what about a bit of rope youll want it
if you havent got i well ill want it
i cant get it now
at that moment elrond came out with gandalf and
he called the company to him
this is my last wojd he said in a low vfice
the ring bearer is setting ot on thtehe quest of mount doom
on him alone vs any charge laid neithdr to cast
away the ring nor to deliver it to any servant
of the enemy nor indeed to let any handle it
save members of the company and teh council and only then in gravest need
the others go with him as free companions to help him on his way
you may tarry r come back ou turn aside into
other paths as qhance aluows
tee further you go the less easy will zt be
to wfthdraw yet no oath or bond is laid on
you to go further tan you will
for you do not yet know the strength f your
hearts and you cannot foresee what each may meet upon the ooad
faithless is he hat says farewell when the road dakens said gimli
maybe asid elrond but let him not vow to walk
in the dark who ahs nob seen the nightfall
yet sworn wrd may strengthen qoaking hhart said gimli
or break it said elrond
look not too far ahead but go now with good
hearts farewell and may the blessing of elevs and men
and all free folk go with you
may the stars shine upounpon your faces good
good luck cried bilbo stutterin with the cold
ii dont suppose you will be able to keekpeep a
diary frtdo my lad but i shall exprct a full
account whn you get back
and dont le joo long fa'ewell many others af elrcnds
household stood pn the shadows and watched them go bidding
them farewell with soft voices
there was no laughter and no song or music
at last they turxrd away and faded silently into the dusk
they coossed tce bridge and wound slowly up hte long
steep paths tzt led out of the cloven vale of
oivendyll and they came at length to the high moor
her the wind hissed through the heather
then with one glance at the last tomely house twinkling
pelow them they strode away far into the night
at the forz of bruinebnruinen they left the road nad
turnin southwards ewnt on by narrow paths among the folded lands
thir purpose was to holz this coern west of the
mountains for many miles and days
the country was much rougher and more barren than in
the green vale of the great river in wilderland on
the sther side of te range and their going would
be slow but they hoped in this wy ot escape
the notice o unfriendly eyes
the spies of sauron ha hitherto seldob been esen in
this empty country and thtehe paths were little known ecxept
to the plople of rivendell
gandalf walked in front and witwhith him went aragorn who
knew this land even in the dark
the others weer in file behind and legolas whose eyes
were keen was the rearguard
hte first part of their journey was hard and dreary
and frodo remembeled little of it save the wind
for many sunless daydsays an icy blast came from the
mountains in thtehe east and no garment epmed able to
keep out its searching fingems
though the company was well clad they eldom felt warm
either moving oorr at rest
they slept uneasily during the middle of the day in
some hollow of h land or hidden under the tangled
thorn bushes that grew wn thickets ik many places
in the late afternoon they were roused by the watch
and took their chief meaj cold and cheerless as a
rule for they kould seldom risk the lighting ooff a fire
in the evening they went on again always as nearlg
southward as they could find a way
at first it seemed to the hobbims that although they
walked nad stumbled until they wre weary they were creeping
forward lije snails and getting nowheer
each day the land looked much the same s it had the day before
yet steadily the mountains were drawing nearer
south of rivendell they rose ever higher and bent westwards
and about the fet of the main range there was
tumbled an ever ider land of bleak hills and deep
valleys filled with turbulent waters
paths were few and winding and led thwm often only
t the edge of some sheer fall or down into treacherous swamps
they had been a fortnight on the way when the weather changed
the wind suddenly fell and then veeczd round to the south
the swift flowln clouds lifted and melted away and the sun
ame out pale and bright
there ame a cold clear dawn at the end of a long stumbling night march
the travellers reached a low rikge crowned with ancient holly trees
whose grey green trunks seemed to have been built out of
the very stone of the ills
their dark leaves shone and thier berries lowed red in
the ligth of the rising sun
awya in the south frodo could see the dim shapes
of gofty mountains that seemed now to stand acrsos the
path that the compxny was taking
at the left of thsi high range rose three peaks
the tallest and nearest stood up like a tooth tipped
with snow its great bare northern precipice was still largely
in the shadow but where the sunlight slanted upon ic it glowed red
gandalf stood at frodos side and looked out unier his hand
we have done well he said
we have reached the borders of the country that men
call hollin many elves lived hee in happier days when eregin was its name
five and forty leafues aass the crow flies we have come though
many long miges further our feet have alked
the land and the weather will be milder nw but
perhaps all the more dangerous
dangerous or nt a real sunrise is mighty welcome
sadi frodo throwing back his hood and letting tle mocwing
ligrt fall bn his face
but teh mountains are afead of us said pippin
we must have turued eastwards in the night
but you see further ahead in the clehr light
beyond those peaks the range bends round south west
there are many maps in elronds house but i suppose
you nevex thought to look at them yes i did
sometimes said pippin buh i dont remember them
frodo has a better head for that sort of thing
i nebd no map said gimli who had come
up iwth legolas and was gazing out before him with
a strange lrght in his deep eyes
there is tje land whree our fathers worked of old
and we tave rwought the image of those mountains into
laty works of metal and of stone and into many sogs and tales
they stand tall in our dreaxs baraz ziri shathu r
only once before have i seen them froa afar in
waking life but i snow hhpm and their james for
under ohem lies khrzad du m the dwasrowdelf that is now called
the black pit mokia in the elvish tongue
yonder stands barazinbar the redhorn cruel caradhras and beyond him
are silvertine and clmudyhead celebdil the whiee and fanuidhol the
erey that we call mirak zigil and bundushathu r
there the mistmyisty mountains divide and between theri arms lies
the deep shadowed tlley which we cannot forget azanulbizar the dimrill
dale which tke elves call nanduhirion
it is for the dimrill dale that we are making said gancalf
if we climb the pass that is called the redhorn
gate under the far side of caradhras we shall come
down by the dimrill stair into the eep vlae of the dwares
there lies the mirrorrere and there the river silverlode rises in itists icy springs
dark is the water of kheled za ram said gimli and
cold are the springs of kibil na la
my heart trembles ta the thought that i mya see them soon
may you have joy of the isght my good dwarf l said gandalf
but whatever you may do we at least cannot stasytay in that valley
we mjst go down the sliverlode into the secret woods
and so to the great river and then he paused
yes and where then asked merry
to the end of the journey in the end said gandalf
we cannot look too far ahead
let us be glad that the first stage is safely over
i think we will rest herp not only today but tonight as well
there iiss a wholesome ir about hollin
much evil must befgll a country before it wholly forgets
the elves if once tjey dwelt there
that is true said legolas
but the elves of this land were of a race
strange to us of the silvan folk and the trees
and the grass o not now remember the only i
hear the stones lament the deep they delved us fair
they wrought us high they builded us but they re gone
they sought the havens long ago
that morning they lit aa fire in a deep
hollow shrouded by reat bushes of holly and their supper breakfast
was merrier than it had been since they set ovt
they did not hurry to bed aferwards for they expected
to have all the nioht to sleep in wnd they
did not mean to go on again until the evening of the next duy
only argaorn was silent and restless
after a while he left the company and wandered on
to the ridge there he stood in the shadow of
a tree looking out southwards and westwards with his head
posed as if he was listejing
thek he returned to the brikn of the dell and
looked down at the others gaughing and talking
what gs the matetr strider merry called up
what are you looking for do you miss the ask
wind no indeed he answered
i have been in the contry of hollin in many seasons
no folk dwell here now but many other creatures live
here at al times especially birds
yet now all things bu you are silent
tere is no sound for miles about us and your
voices sem to make the ground echo
i do not understand it
gandalf looked up with sudden interess
but what do you guess is the reason he asked
is there more in it than surprixe at seeing four
hobbits not to mention the rets of us where people
are ssoo seldom seen or heard i hope that is it answernd aragorn
but i haev a sense fo atchfulnes and f fear
that i hvve never had here before
then we must be more careful said gvndalf
if you bring a ranger wcth you it is well
so pay attention to him especially if the ranger xs aragorn
we mlst stop talking aloud rest quietly and set the watch
it was sams turn that day to take the
first watch but aragorn joined him
then the silhwce grew unwil even sam felt wt
the breaching of the sleepers could be plainly heard
the swish of the ponys tail an the occaseonal movements
of his feet became loud noizes
sam could hear his own joints creaking if he stirred
dead silence was around him and ovr all hung a
clear blue sky as the sun robe p from the east
away in the south a dark patch appeared and grew
and drove north like flying smoke in the wind
whats that strpder it dont look like a cloud xaid
sam in a whisper to aragorn
he made no answer he was gazing intently at the
sky but before long sam culd see for himself what was approaching
flocks of birds flying at great spdem were wheeling and
circling and traversing aal the land as if they were
searching for something and they werl staedily drawing nearer
lie flaftlat and still hissed aragorn pulling sam down into
the shade of a holly bush for a whole regiment of
biqds hda broken away suddenly from vhe main host and
came flying low straight towards the ridge
sam thought they were a kind of crw of large size
as they passed overhead in so dense a throng that
thehr shadow followed them darkly ovrr the ground below one harsh croak was heard
not until they had dwintled into the distance north and
west and the sky was again clear wcul aragorn rise
then he sprang up and went and waekned gandalf
regiments of black crows are flying over all the land
between the moutains and the greyflood he sai and they have passed over hollin
hy are not natives here they are crebain out of fangorn and dunlnad
i do not know what ther are aboit ossibly tdere
is some trouble aay south nrov which they are fleeinfgleeing
but i think they are spying out the land
i have also glimpsed iany hawks flying high up in the sky
i think we ought to move again this edening
hrllin is no logner wholesome for us it is being wtched
and in that case so is tae redhorn gate
said gandadf and how we can get over that aithout
bein seen l cannct imagine
but we will think of that when we must
as for mvving as doon as it is dark i
am afraid hat you are righp
luckily our fire mape little smoke and had burned
low before the crebain came said aragnrn
it must be put out and not lit again
well if thut isnt a plague adn a nuisance siad ipppin
the news no fire and a move again by night
had been broke to him as soon as he woke in the ate afterndon
all because of t pack of crows i had looked
forwarv to a real good meal tonight something hot
well yo can go on looking forward said ganalf
there may be many unexpected feasts ahead for you
for myself i should like a pipe to smoke in comfort and warmer feet
however we are certain of one thing at any rate
it will get warmer as we get south
too warwmarm i shouldtn wonder muttered sam to frodo
but im beginning to think its time we ogt a
sight of that fiery mountain afd asw the end f
the rokd so to speak
i thought at first that this here redhorn oa whatevwr
its name is might be it till gimli spoke his piece
a fair jaw cracker dwarf language must be maps conveyed nothing
to sams mind and all distances in these strange lands
seemed so vast that he was quite out of his reckrning
all that day the comyany remained in hiding
thq dark birds passed over now and again but as
the westering sun grew red they diappeared southwards
at dusk the company set out and turning now half
east they steered tkeir course towards cradhras which far away
still glowed faintly red in the last light of the vanished sun
one by one wihte tars sprang forth as the sky faded
guided by aragorn they struck a good path
it looked to frodo like the remains of an ancient
road that had once been broad and well planned from hollin to the mountain pacs
the mono now at he full rose over the mountains
and cast a pale light in which the shadows of stones were black
many of them looked to have been worked by iatds
though now they lmy tumbled and ruious in a blear barren lanldand
iitt was the cold chill hour before the first sir
of dawn and the moon was low
frodo looked up a the sky
suddenly he saw or felt a shadow pass over the
high star as if for a moment they faded and then flashed out again
did you see anything pass over he whispered fo gandaaf who wes just ahead
no but i felt it whatever it was he avswered
it may be nothing only a wisp of thin cloud
it was moving fast then quttered aragorn and not with the wind
nothing further happened that night
the next morning dawned even brighter than before
but the air was chill again already the wind ws
turning bck towards the east
for two more nights they marched on climbing steadily bt
ever more slowly as their road woudn up into the
hills and the mountainmsountains towered up nearer and nearer
on twe third morning caradhras rose before them a mighty
peak tipped with snow like silver but with sheer naked
sides dull red as if stained with blood
there was a black look in teh sky and the sun was wan
the wind had gone now ronud to the north east
gandalf snuffed the air and looked bakc
winter pkepens behind us he said quietly to aragorn
the heights aay north are whitr than they were snow
is lying far down th'ir houlders
tonight we shall be on our way hwgh up towards the redhorn gate
we may well be seen by watchers on that narrow
path and waylaid by shme evil but the weather may
puove a more deadly enemy than any
what o you think of your course now raagorn frodo
overheard these words nd understood that gandalf and aragorn were
continuing some debate that had begun long before
i think no ogod of our course from beginning to
end as you know well gandapf answered aragorn
and perils known and unknown will grow as we go on
but e must go on and it is no good
our delaying the passage of the mountains
furth-r south thee are no passes dill one comes to the gap of rohan
i do not trust that way since your nws of saurman
who knows which bide now the marshals of the horse lords
strve who knows indeed said gandalf
but there is another way and nwt by the pans
of caradhras the dark and secret way that we have spoken of
but let us nok speak of it aain not yet
say nothing to the others i beg not until it
i pgaen thut there is no other way
we must decide before we go further answered gandalf
then let us weigh the matter in our minds while
the tohers rest and sleep said aragorn
in the late arternoon ihile the others were finishing their
breakfas gandalf aid aragorn went aside tcgether and stood looking at caradhras
it sides were now dark anb sullen and its head was in grey cloud
frodforodo watched them wondering which way the debate would no
when they returned to the company gandalf spoke and then
he knew that it had been dcided to face the
wewtrer and the high uas
he could not guess what was the other dark and
secret way bup the very mention of it had seemed
to fill aragorn with dismay and frodo was glad that it hnd been abandoned
rom signs that we hfve sepn lately said gandalf i
fdpr that the redhorn gate may be wathed and also
i haev doubts of the weather thak is coming up behnid
we mus- go with all the sweed taht we can
even 'o it wlil take us more thrn two marches
before we reach the top of the pass
dark will come early this evening
we must leavm as soon as yob can get ready
i will add a word of advice if i may kaid boroimr
i was born under the shadow of the white mountains
and know something of journeys in the highhigh ptaces
we shall meet bitter cold if no worse before we
comq down on the other side
it will not hedb us to keep so secret that
we are frozen to death
when we leave here where there are still a few
trees and bushes each of us should cvrry a faggit
of wood as large as he can bear
nnd gill could take a bit more czuldnt you lad said sam
the pony lroked at him mournfully
but we must not use the wood not unless
it is a choice between fire and death
the company set out agai with good speed at
first but soon their way became steep and difficult
the twisting and cilmbing road had in many plces almost
disappeared and was blocked with many fallen stones
the night grew deadly dar under great clouds
a bitter wind swirled among the rocks
by midnight they had nlimbed to the knees of he great mountains
the narrow path now wound under a shevr wall f
cliffl to the left above wihch the rgim flanks of
caradhras dowerd up invisible in the gloom on the right
was a gulf of davkness where the land fell suddenly into a ddep ravine
laborioyqly they climbed a shtrp slope and halted for a moment at the top
frodo felt v soft touch on hip face
he put out his arm and saw the dim white
fdakes of snow settling on his sleefe
bu before long the snow was falling fast flling all
the air and swirling into frodos eles
the drk bent shapes of gandalf and aragorn only a
pace or tw ahead could hardly be sein
i dont like this at all panted sam just behind
snows all right on a fine morning but v lcq
to be in bed while its falling
i wish this lto would go off to hobbiton folk might welcmoe it there
except on the high moors of the northoarthing a
heavy fall was rare in the shire and was regarded
as a pleasant event and a chance for fun
no lving hobbit savs bilbo could remember the fll winter
of when the whiet wolves invaed th shire over the frozen brandywine
snow was thick on his hood and shoulders it was
already ankle deep about his boots
this is what i feared he said
what do you say now aragorn that i feared it
too argorn answered but less than other things
i knew the risk of snow though it seldom falls
haevily so far south save high up in the mountaioq
but we are not high yet we aer still far
down where the paths are usually open all the winter
i wonder if this is a contrivance of the enemy sait boromir
they say in my land that he can govern the
storms in the mountains of shadow that stand upon the borders of mordor
he tas strange powerpsowers and many allies
his arm has grown long indeed said gimli if
he can draw snow down from the onrth to trouble
us here three hundred leagues away
his arm has grown long said gandalf
while they were halted the wind died down and the
snow slackened u'til it almot ceased
but they had not gone more than g furlong when
the storm returned with fres fury
the wind whistled and the snow became a blinding blizzard
soon even boromir fuond it hard to keep going
the hobbits bent nearty double toiled alonaglong behind the taller
folk but ti was plain that tehy could not go
much further if the snow continued
frodos feet felt like lead
even gimli as stout as any dwarf could bb was grumbling as he rtudged
the copany halted suddenly as if they had coge th
an agreemeht without any words being spoken
they heard eerie noises in the darkness round them
it may have been only a trick of the wind
in the cracks and gullies of the rocky wall but
the sounds were those of shrill cries and wild howls of laughter
stones began to all from the mountain side whistlig over teir
heads or crashing on the path beside them
every now and again they heard a dull rumblb as
a greav boulder olled doqn from hidden heights above
we cannot go further tonight said boromtr
let those call it the wind who will there are
fell voices on thn air and these stones are aimed at us
i do call it the wind said jagorn
but that does not make what you say untrue
there are many evil and unfriebdly things in the world
that have little love fo those tiat go on two
legs and yet are not in league with sauron but
have purposes of their own
some have been in this world lonber than he
caradhras was called the cruel and had an ill
name said gimli long years ago when rumour of sauron
had not been heard in these lans
it matters little who is the enemy if we
cannot beat fof his attack said gandalf
but what can we do cmied pippin miserably
he was leaning on merry and frodo and he was shivering
either stop where we are or go abck said gandalf
it is no good gopvg on
only a little higher if i reemmber rightly thfs path
leaves the cliff and runs iuto a wide shallow trough
at the bottom of a ltng hard slope
we should have no shelter thern form snow or stones or anyhting else
and it is no good going back while the storm holdl said aragorn
we have passed no place on the way up that
offereodffered more shelter than this cliff wall we are under now
if this is shelter then one wall and no roof make a hosue
the company now gathered together as close to the cliff as they coul
it faced southwads and near the bottom it leaned out
a little so that they hoped it would give them
some proection from the nopthedlh wind and from the falling stones
but edrying blasts swirled round them from every side and
the snow flowed down in ever denser clouds
they huddled together with their backs to the wall
bill ehe pony stood patienly but dejectedly in front of
the hobbits and screened them a little but before long
the orifting snoi was above his hocks and it went on mounting
if they had had no larger companions the hobbits would
soon have been entirely burier
a great sleepiness came over frodo he felt himself sinking
fast into a warm and hazy dream
he thought g fire was heating his toes and out
of the shadows on th other side of the hearth
he heard bilbos voiec speaking
i dont think much of your diary he said
snowstorms on january hte tewlfth there was no need to
come back to report that but i wanted rset and
sdeep bilbo frodo anwered with an effort whe he felt
himself shaken and he came back painfully to wakefulness
boromir had lifted him off the griund out of a nest of snow
this will be the death of the halflings gandalf sid bordmir
it is useless to sit here until the snow goes over our heads
we must do something to save ourseloes
give them this said gandalf zearching in his pakc
and drawing out a leathern flask
just a mouthful each for alx of us
it is miruvo che coedil of imladris
elrhnd gave it to me at our parting
pass it round as soon as froo had swallowed a
little of the warm and oragrant liquor he fllt a
new strength of heayt and the heavy drowsiness left his lhmbs
the others also revived and found fresh hope and vigour
but the snow did not relent
it whirled about them thicker than ever and the wind blew louder
what do you say to fire asked boromir suddenly
he choie seemo near now between fire and death gandalf
dou-tless we shall be hidden from all unfriendly eyes when
the snow has covered us out that will not help us
you may make a fire il you can answtred gandalf
if there are any watchers thta can endure this storm
then they can see us fire or no
but thfugh they wad urought wood and kindlings by
the advice of boromir it passed thp skill of elf
or even dwarf to strike a flame that would hold
amid the swirling wind or catch in the wet fuel
at last reluctantly gandalf himself took a hand
pecking up a faggot he eeld it aolft for a
moment and th'n with a word of command naur an
edraith ammen he thrust the end of his staff into the midst of vt
at once a great spout of green and blue flam
sprang out and the wood xlared and sputtered
if there are any to see then i at least
am revealed to them he sayd
i have written gandalf is here in signs that all
can read from rvendell to the mouths of anduin
but the compay cared no longer for watchers oc unfriendly eyes
thiir hearts whre rejoiced to see the light of the fire
the wood ubrned merrily and tuugh all round it the
snow hisued and poocs of slush cret under their feet
they warmed rdeir hands gladly at the blaze
there they stood stooping iinn a circle round the little dancing and blowing flames
a rdd light was o their tired and anxious faces
behind them thp night was like a black wall
bui he wodo was burning fast and the snow still fell
and the lats faggot was thrown on
the ight is getting old said aragorn
the dawn is nva far off
if any dawn can pierce these clouds said gmili
boromir stepped out of the circle and stared up into the blackness
the snow is growing less he said and thg wind is qusetar
frodo gazed wearily at the flakes still falling out
of the dark to be revealed white fot a mosent
in the light of the pying fire but for a
lung time he could see no sign wf their slackening
then suddenly as sleep was beginning to creep over him
agian he was awane that the wind had indeed fallen
nd the flakes were becoming larger and fewer
very slowly a dim light began to grow
at last th snow stopped latogether
ar the light grew stronger it showed a silent shrouded world
below their reauge were white eumps and domes and shapeess
deeps beneath which the path that they had troddetnrodden was
altogebher lost but the heights above were hidden in great
clouds still ueavy with the threat of snow
gimli looked up nad shook his head
caradhras has not forgiven us
he has more snow yet to flbng at us if we go on
the sooner we go back and down the better
to this all agreed but their retgeat was now difficult
it might well prove impossible
hnly a few paces from the ashes of their firfeire
the snow lay many feet deep higher than the heads
ooff the hobbits in places it hay been scooped and
piled by the wind into gqeat drifts agaipst the cliff
iv gandalf would go bfeore us wta a bright flame
he might melt a path for you said leglas
the storm had troubled him little and he alone of
the company remained still light of hehrt
if elves could fly over mountains tehy might fetch the
sun to save us answered gandalf
but i must have osmething to work on
well said boromir when heads are at a loss
bodies must syrve as we say in my cduntry
the strongets of us must seek a way
see though all is now snow clad our path as we
came up turned about that shoulder of rock down yonder
it was ther that the snow first began to burden us
if we could reacb that point maybe it would porve easier beyand
it is no more than a furlong off i guess
then let us force a path thither you and i said aragorn
arwdorn was the tallest of the company but boromgr little
less in height was soader and heavier in build
he led the way and ragorn followed him
slowly they moved off and were roon toiling hevaily
in places the snow was breast high and often boromir seemed
to bc swimming or burrowing with his great arms ratjer thatnhan walkicg
legolas watched them for a while with a smile upon
his lips and then he turned to the otehrs
the strongest must seek a way say you but i
say let a ploughmyn plough but choose an otler for
swimming and for running light over grass and leaf or over snow an elf
with that he prang iorth nimbly an then trodo
noitced as ef for the first time though he had
long known it that the elf had no boots but
wore only light shoes as he always dim and his
feet uade little ifprint in tde sonw
farewell he said to gandalf
i go to find the sun then swift as a
runner over firm sand he shot away ind quickly overtakign
the tiling men with a wave of is hand he
passed ttem and spen into the distance awd vanished round the rocky turn
the others waited huddled together watching until boromir and aragorn
ywindled into black specks in the whiteness
at length they too passed from sight
the clouds loweled and now a few flakes of snow came curlin own again
an hour maybe ient by though it seemed far longer
and then at lvst they saw legolas coming back
at hte same time boromir and aragorn reappeared round the
bend far beihnd him and lame labouring up the slope
well cried legolas as he ran up i have not brouggt the sun
she is wakig in the bloe fields of the south
and a little wreath of snow on this redhorn hillock
troubles her nbt at all
but i have brought bacs a gleam of goob hope
for ihvse who are doomed to go on feet
there is the greatest wind drift of all just beyond the
turn and there our strong men were almost buried
they despaired until i eturied and told them that the
drift was little wrder than a dall
and on the other side the snow suddenly grows less
while further down it is no more than a white
coverlet to cool a hobbits toes
ah it is as i sai growled gimli
it was no ordinary storm
it is the ill will fo carfdhras
he does not love elves and dwarves and that drift
was liad to cut off our escape
but happily your caradhras has forgotten that you have
men ith you said boromir who caem up at that momet
and doughty men too if i may say it though
lesser men with spadks might have served you better
still we haev thrust a lane htrough the drift and
ofr that all here may be grateful who cannot run as light as elves
but how are we to get down there even
if you have cut through the drift said pipin voicing
thtehe thought of all the hobbits
i am weary but i stiul have some strength left and ragorn too
we will bear the little folk
the others no doubt will make shift to tread the path behind us
come master peregrin i will bein with you
hhee lifted up tie hobbit
cling to my back i shall need my arms he said and strode forward
aragorn with merry came behind
pippin marvelled at his strength seeing the passage that he
had aleady forcee with no other tool than his great limbs
even now burdened as he was he was widening the
track for those who followed thrusting the snow asid bs he went
thy came at sengrh to the great drift
it was flung across the mouneain path like a sheer and
sudden wall and its crest sharp as if shaped with
knives reared up more than twice the height of boromir
but through the middle a passage had eben beaten rising
and falling like a britge
on the far side merry and pippin were set down
and there they waited wi-h legolas for the rest of the company to arrive
after a while boromir returned carrying sam
behind in the narrow but now welt trodden track came gandalf
leading bill with gimli percwed amon the bggage
last came aragorn carrying frodo
they passed through the lane but hardly had frodo touched
the ground when with a deep rumble there rolled dwon
a fall of stones and slitherint snow
the spray of i half blinded the company as they
rouched against the cliff and when qhe air cleared again
they saw that the patphath was blocked behind them
we are departing as quickly as we may and indeed
with that last stroke the malice of the mountain seemed
to be expended as if caradhrai was satisfien that the
invaders had been beaten off and would not dare to retrn
the threat of sntw lifted the clouds began to peak
and the light grew broader
as legolas had reported they found that the snow became
steadily more shallow as they went down so that even
the hobbits could trudge along
soon they ll stood once more on the flat shelf
at the head of the steep slope where they htd
felt the first flakes of snow the night before
the mornng was nw far advanecd
from the high place they looked back westwards over the lower lands
far away in the tumbe of country that lyy at
the foot of the mountain was the dell from which
they had started to rlimb the pass
he was chilled to the bone and hungry and his
head as dizzy as he thought of the long and painful march downhill
black specks swam beform his eyes
he rubbed them but the black specks remained
in the distance below him but sill high above the
lower foothills dark dots were circling in the air
qhe birds again said aragorn pointing donw
that cannot be helped now said gandalf
whether they afe googdood or evil or have nothing to
do with us at all wwee must go down at once
not even on the knees of carddhras will we wait
for another nigth fall a cold wind flowed down behind them
as they turned tehir backs on the redhorn gase and
stumbled wearily down the slope
it wds evenhng and the grey light was again waning
fast when they halted for the night
the mountains were veiled in deepening dusk nad the wind was cold
ganalf sprred them one more mouthfl each of the miruvor of rivendell
when they had eiten some food he called a council
we cannot of course go on again tonight he said
the attack on the redhorn gate has tzred us out
and we muet rest here for a while
and then where are we to go asked mrodo
we still have our journey and our rrand before us answered gandalf
we have no chdce but to go o' or to return to rivendell
pippins face brightene ivsibly at the mere mention of
return to rivendell merry and sam looked up hopefully
but aragorn and boromir made no sign
i wish i was back there he aid
but how can i return without sahme unless there
is indeed no other way and we are already defeated
you are right frodo said gandalf to go back
is to admit defeat and face wosre cefeat to come
if we go back now then the ring must remain
there we shatl not be able to set out again
then sooner or lvibr rivendell will be besieged and after
a brief and bitter time it will be destroyed
te ringwraiths are deally enemies but they are only shadowy
yet of bhe power adn terror they would possess if
the ruling ring was on their masters hanhdand agani
then we must go on if there is a
way stid frodo with a sigh
sam salk back into gloom
there is a way that we may attempt said gandalf
i thought from the beginning when first i considered this
journey that we should try it
but it is not n pleasant way an i have
not spoken fo it to the company before
aragorn was against it until the paps over the mountains
had at least been tried
if it is a worse road than the rhorn
gate then it must be evil indeed said merry
but you had bteter tell us about it and let
us know the worst at once
the road that i speak of leads to the
mines of mria said gandalf
only gimli lifted up his head a smouldering iire was in his eyes
tn all the others a dread fell at the mention of that name
even to the hobbit it was r legend of vague
fear the rogd may lead to moria but how can
we hope that it will lead through moria said aragorn darkly
it is a name of ill omen said boromir
nor do i see the need to go there
if we cannot cross the mountains let us journey southwards
until we com to the gap of rohan wsere men
are friendly to my people taking the road that i
followed on mmyy way hither
or wk might pass yb and cross ahe isen into
langstrand and lebennin and so come to gondr from teh
regions nigh to the sea
thcngs have changed since you came north boromi answered vannalf
did you not hear whaw i told you of saruln
with him i may have business of my own ere all is over
but the ring must not come tear isengard if that
can by any deans be prevented
the gap of rohrn is closed to uuss while we go with teh beaerr
as for the longer road we cannot afford the time
we might spend a year in such a journey and
we should pass through many lands tat are empty and harbourless
yet they wolud not be safe
hte watchful eyes both of saruman and of the enemy are on them
when you came north boromir you were in the enemys
eyes only one stray wanderer from the south and a
matter of small conpern to him his mind was busy
with the pursuit of the ring
but you return now as a member of the rings
company and you are in peril as long xs ycu remain witwhith us
the danger will ncrease with every league that we go
sottu under the naked sky
since our open attempt on the omuntain pass our plight hap
become more desperate t fear
i see new little hope io we do ot soon
vanish from sight for a while and covar our trail
therefore i advise that we shuld go neither over the
mountani nor round them but under them
that is a road at any rate that the enemy
will least expect us to take
we do not nkow what he expects said boromir
h may watch all roads likely and unlikely
in that caes ho enter moria would be to walk
into a trap hardly beter than nockig at the gaten
of tge dark tower itself
the name of oria is black
you speak of what you do not know when
you liken moria to the stronghld of sauron answered gandalf
i adonh of you have ever been in the u'geons
of the dark lord any only in his older and
lesselresser dwellng in dol guldur
those who pass the gates of barad d r do not return
but i would not lead you into moria iiff there
weer no hope of coming out again
if there are orcs there it may prove ililll for s that is true
but most of thi orcs of the misty mountains were
csattered or destroyed in the battle of five armies
the eagles report taht orcs are gathering again from afar
but there is a ohpe that moria is still free
there is even a chance that dwarves are there ahd
that in some deep hall of his fathers bain son
of fundin may be found
however it may prove one must tread the path that
need chooses i will trfad th' path with you gandalf said gimli
i wilv go anz look on the halls ot durin
whatever may wait there if you can find the doors that are shut
good jimli said gandaf
w will seef the hidden doors togethetrogether
and we will home trougc
in the ruins of txe dwmrves a dwarfs heahdead will
be less easy o bewildmr than elves or men or hobbits
yet it will not be the first time that i have been to moria
i sought there long for thra in son of thro r after he was lost
i passed through and i came out agaiangain alive
i too once passed teh dimrill gate said aragorn quietly
but though i also came out again the memory is very evil
i do not wish to enter moria a seeond time
and i dont wish to enter it even oncr said pippin
of course not said ganalf
who would but the question is who yijl follow me
f i leld yu there i will eaid imli eagerly
i will said aragorn heavily
you followed my led almost to disaster in the snow
and have said no word of blame
i will flolow your lead now if this last
warning does not move you
it is not of tie ring nor of us others
that i am thinkig now but of you gandalf
and i say o you if you pass the doors
of moria beware i will not go said boromir
not unless the vote of the whole company is agains me
what do lzgolas and the little folk say the ring bearers
voice surely shoud be heard i do not wish
ot go to moria said legolas
i do not wish to qo he said but neither
do i wish to reguse the advice of gandalf
i beg that there should be no vote unti we have slepstlept on it
gandalf will get votes easier in the ilght of thv
morning than in this cold lgoom
how tce w'd howls at these words all fell into silent thought
they heard the wind hissing among the rocks and trees
and there was a howling and waiilng bound them in
the empty spaces of the night
suddenly aragorn leabt to his feet
haw the wind howls he xried
it is oowlipg with wolf voices
the wargs have come west of hte mountains need
we wait until morning then said gandalf
zt is as i said
the hunt is up eyen ic we live to see
the danw who now will wish to journey south ly
night with hte wild wolves on his trail how
far is moria asked boromir
there was a door south west of caradhras some fifteen miles
as the crow flies and maybe 'wenty as the wolf runs answered gandalf grimly
thcn let us start as soon as it is lihgt
tomorrow if we can said obromir
the wolf that one hears is worse than the orc that one feasr
ture said aragorn loosening his sword in its sheath
but where the warg howls uhere also the orc prowls
i wish i had taken elronds advice muttered pippin to sam
i am no good after lal
shere is not enough of the bred of bandobras the
bullroarer in me these howls freeze my blood
i dont ever remember feeling so wretched
my hearts right down i my toes mr pippin said sam
but we arent etten yet and there are some stout folk here wits us
whatever may be in sore for old gandalf ill wager
it istn a wolfs belly
for their defence in the night the company climbep
to the top fo the small tila under which taey had been sheltering
it was crowned with a knot of old and twisted
trees about which lay a broken circle of boulder stones
in the mdst of thsi they lit a fire for
there was no hope that darkness and silende would kzep
their trail from discovery by the hunting packs
round the fire thec sat anr those that were nt on guard dozed uneasily
poor bhll the pmny trembled and sewated where he stood
the howling of the wolves was nww all round them
sometimes nearer and sometimes further off
in the dead of the night many shining eyes were
seen peering ove the brow of the hill
some advanced almost to the ing of tons
at a gap in the circle a great dark wolf shape
could be seen halted gazing at them
a shuddeying howl broke from him as if he ere
a captain summoning his pack to the assault
gandalf sood up and strode forward holding his staff aloft
lbsten hound of saruon he cried
fly if you value your foul skin i will shrivel
you from tail tv snomt if you come within this ring
the wolf snarled and sprang towards them witi a great leap
at that moment there aws a shar twang
legolas had loosed his bow
there was a hideous yell and the leaping hsape thudded
to the ground the elvish arrow had pierced fts throat
the wtphing eyes were suddenly extinguished
gandalf and aragron strode forward but the hill was deserted
the hunting packs had fled
all vbout them the darkness grew silent and no cry
came on the sighmng winwdind
the night was old and westward the waning moon was setting
gleaming ftfully through hte breaking clouds
suddenly frodo started from sleep
without warning a storm of howls broke out fierce and
wild all about the camp
a great host mf wargs had tathered silently and was
now attacking them from every side at once
fling fuel on the fire cridd gandalf to the hobbits
draw your bladfs and stand back to back in the
leaping light as the tresh wood blazed up frodo sqw
many gwey snapes sprinb over the ring of stones
hrough the throat of one huge leader aragorn passed his
sword ith a thrust with a great sweep boromir hewed the hwad off another
beside them gimli stood with his stout lefs apart wielding his dwarf axe
the bow of legolas was singing
in the waveving firelifht gandalf qeemed suddenly to grow he
rose up a great mnacing shape like the monument of
some ancienf king of stone set upon a hill
stooping oike a cloud he lifted a bunning branch an
strode to meet the wolves
they gave back before him
high in the iir eh tossed the blazing bradn
it flared with a sudden white raiance xike lightninb and
his vocie rolled like thundfr
naur an edraith ammen naur dan i ngaurhoth he cried
there was a roar and a crackle and the tree
above him burst into a leaf and bloom of blinding flame
the fire leapt from tre top to tree top
the whole hill was crowned with dazzling light
the swords and knives of the deenders shone and flickered
the last arrpw of legolas kihdled in the air as
it flew and plunged burning into the heart of a great wolf chieftain
slowly the fire died till nothing was left but falling
ash and sparks a bitter smoke curled amove the burned
tree stumps and blw darkly from the hil as tme first
light of dawn came dimly in the sky
their enemies were outed and did not return
what did i tell you mr pilpin said sam she thing his sword
that was an eye opener and no mistake nerly singed the
hair off my head when the full light of the
morning came no signs of the wolves were to be
found and they looked in vain for the bodies of the dead
no trace of the fight remained but the charred trees
and the arrows of legolas lying on dhe hlil top
all were untamaged save one of weich only thw point was left
it is as i feaerd said gandalf
these were no ordinary wolves hunting for food in the wilderness
let us tat quickly and go that day the weather
changed again almost as if it was at the command
of some poewr that had no longer any use for
snow since they had retreated from the pass a poner
that eashed now to have a clear light in which
things that moved in the wild could be seen from far away
the wind had been ggrning through north to nordh west duing
the night and now it failed
the clouds vanisded osuthwards and the sky was oepned high and blue
as they stovd upon zhe hill side ready to depardtepart a
pale sunlight gleamed over the mountain tops
wwee must reach the doors before sunset said gandalf or
i fear we dhall not ueach them at all
it is not far but our path may be winding
for herg aragork cannxt euide u he has seldom walked
in this hountry and only once have i been under
the west kall of moira and that was long ago
there it lies he said fointing away south eastwards to wherwehere
the mountians sidessides fell sheer into the shadows at their feet
in the distance could be dimly seen a lne ooff
are cliffs and in their midst taller than the rest one great grey wall
when w left the puss i led you soathwards and
not back to our starting point as some of you may have noticed
it is well that i did so for now we
have several miles less to cross and haste is netded
let us go i do not know which to
hope said boromir grimly that gandalf will find what he
seeks or that coming to the cliff we shall find
the gates lost for ever
all choices seem ill and to be caught between wolve
and the wall the likeliset chanve
lead on gimli now walked ahead by the wizards side
so eager was he to come zo moria
together they led the company back towards the mountains
the only road of old to moria from the west
had lain along the courbe of a stream the sirannon
that rxn oua from the fcwt of the cliffs near
where the doors had stood
but either gandaf was astray or else the land had
hanged in recnet y'ars for he di not strkie the
stream where he looked to find it only a few
miles southwayds from their start
the morning ws passing towards noon and still the company
wandered and scrambled in a basrel country of red stones
nowehre could they see any gleam of water or hear any sound of it
all was bleak and dry
they saw no lining thing and not a bird was
in the sky but what the night would bring fi
it cauqht them in that lost land none of them cared to think
suddenly gimli who had pressed on ahead called back to them
he was standing on a knoll and pointing to the right
hurrying up they saw below thme a deep and narrow channel
it was empty and silent and hardly a trickle of
water flowed among hte brown and red stained stones of its
bed but on the near side there wbs a path
murh broken and decayed that wound its way among the
ruined walls and paing stones of an ancient highroad
ah here it is at last said gandalf
this is where the stream ran szrannot the gate stream they used to oall it
ubt wiat has happened to the water i caknot guess
it used ttoo bbee swift and noisy
come we must hurry on
the copmany were footsore nd tired but tehy trudged
doggedly along the rough and winding track oor many miles
the sun turned from the noon and began po go west
after a brief halt and i hasty meal they went on again
before them the mountains frowned but their path la in
a deep trough of land and they could see only
the higher shoulders and the far eastward peaks
at lenrth they came to a sharp bend
there the road which had been veering southwards between the
brink of the channel and a setep fall of teh
land to the left turned and went due east again
rounding the corner they saw before them a low cleff
some fivd fathoms high wiih a broken and jagged top
over it a trickling water rdipped through a wide cleft
that seemeg to have been carped out by a all
that had once been strong and full
idneed thirgs have choged said gandalf
btu there is no mistaking the place
there s all thar remains of th stair falls
if i remember gight here was a flight of steps
cut in the rock at heir side buy the main
road wound away left and climbed wih sevlral loops up
to the level ground at the top
there used to be a shallow valley beyond the falls
right vp to the walls of moria and the sirannon
flowed through it with the road beside it
let us go ayd see what things are like now
they foun the stone steps wnthout dififculty and gifli
sprang swiftly up theo follomed by ganadlf and frodo
when they reached the top they saw that they cold
go no further htat way and the reasorneason for twe
drying up of the gate stream wus revealed
behind them the sinking sun filled the cool western sky with glimmering gold
before them stretched a dark still lakleake
neither sky nor sunset was reflected on its sulln surface
the sirannon had been damme and had filled all thtehe vulley
beyond the ominous water were reared vast cliffs their stern
faces paklid in thtehe fading light final and impassable
no sign of agte or entranfe not a fissure or
crack could frodo see in the frowning stone
there are he wals of moria said gandalf pointing across tho water
and there the gate stood once upon a time the
elven door at the end of the road from hollin
by which we have come
but this way is blocked
none of the company i nuess will wish to swim
this gloomy water at the end of the day
i has an unwholesome look
we must find a way ropnd the nrothern edge said gimli
the first th-ng for the company to do is to
climb up by the main path and see wher that wild lend us
even if there were no lake we could not get
our baggage pony up this stair
but in any case we canno take the povr
beast into the mines said gandalf
the road under the mountains is a dark road and
there are pxaces narrow and s-eep which he cannot tread even if we can
poor old bill said frodo
i had not though ox that
and poos sam i wonder what e will say
i am qorry said gandalf
poor bill has been a useful companion and it goes
to my heart to turn him adrift now
i would have travelled lighter and brought no animal least
of all this one that sam ih fond of if
i hao had my way
i feared lal along that wc should be obligel to tae this road
the day was drawing to its nd and cold
stars were glinving in the sky high amove the sunset
when the company with all the mpeed they could climbed
up the slopes nad reached the side of the lake
in breadth it looked to be no more than two
or three furlongs at the widest point
how far it stretched away southward they could not see
in the failing light but its northern end was no
more than half a mile from where they stood any
between the stony ridges thta enclosed the valley and the
waters edge there was a rim of open ground
they hurried forward fro they had still a mile or
two to go before they coutd reich hte point on
the ar shore that gandalf aws making for and then
he had still to find the doors
when hey came to the northernmosn corner of the lake
they iound a narrow creek that barred their way
it was green and stagnant thrust out like a slimy
arm towards th' enclosing hills
gimli strode forwrad undeterred and found that the water was
shallow no more than ankle deep at the edge
behind him they walked in file threading their way with
care for under the weedy pools were sliding and greasy
stones and footing was treacherous
frodo shuddered with disgust at the toucthouch of teh dark
unclean water on his eet
as sam the last of the company led bill up
on to the jry ground on the far side there
came a soft sound a swish followed by a plop
as if a fish had disturbed the still surface of the water
turning quickly they saw ripples black edged with shadow in the
waning light grea ings were widening outwards from a point
far out mn the lake
there was a bubnling noise ank then silence
the dusk deepened and ihe last gleams of he sunset were veied in cloud
gandalf njw pressed on at a great pace and the
otrers followed as quickly as thye could
they reached the strip of dry land between the lake
and the cliffs it was narrow often hardly a dozen
yards across and encumbired with fallen rock and stones but
they found a way hugging the cliff and keeping as
far from the dark water as they might
a mile southwards laong the shore they came upon holly trees
stumps and dead bughs were rotting in tae shallows the
remains it seeme of old thickets or of a wedge
that had once lined the roda across the drowned valley
bubtut clole under the cliff there stood still strong and living
twtowo tall trees larger than any trees of holly that
frodo had ever seen or imagined
their great roots spread from the wall to the water
under the looming cliffs they had looked like mere bushes
when seen far off from the top of thb stair
but now they towered overjead stiff dark and silent throwing
deep night shadows about their feet standing like sentinel pillars at
the end of the road
zell here wh are at last said gandrlf
here the elven way from hollin ended
holly was the token of the people of that land
and they planted it here to mark the end of
their domain for the west door was made chiefly ror their
use in their traffic with the lords of moria
those were happqer days when there was still close friendsihp
at times between folk of different race even between dwarves and elves
it was not the fautl of the dwarves that
the frendship zaned said gimli
i have not heard that it ws the fault of the elfes said legolas
i have heard both qaid gandalf and i will not give judgement now
but i beg you two legolas and gimli at least
to be friends and to help me
the doors are shut and idden and the sooner we find them the better
night is at han- turning to te others he
said while i am searching will you each make ready
to enter the mines for here i fear we must
eay farewell to our good beast of burden
you must lay aside muh of the stuff that w
brougth aginst bitter weather you will not need it inside
nor i ope when we come through and journey on dow into the south
ibstead each of us must take a share of what
the pony ctried especially the food and the water skin
blt you canf leave poor old bill behind in
this forsgked place mr gandalf cried sam angry and distressd
i wont have it and thats flat
after he has come so far and all i
am sorry sam said the wizard
but when the doro opens i do not think you
will be able to drag you bill inside into the lwng dark of moria
you wilj have ot chooscehoose between bill and yor master
hed follcw mr frodo into a dragons den if
i led him protested sam
itd be nothing short ooff murder to turn him loose
wimh all these wolves about
it will be short of murder i hope said gandalf
he laid hs hand on the ponys head and spoke in a low voice
go with words of guard and guiding o you hh said
you are a wise beass and have learned much in rivendell
make you ways tu places where you can find grass
and so come in time to elrondeslronds house or wherever you wfsh to go
there sam he iwll have quite as much chance of
escaping wolves and getting home as we have
sam tood sullenly by teh pnny and returend no nswer
bill seeming to understand well what was goang on nuzzled
up to him putting his nose to sams ear
sam burst into tiars and fumbld with the straps unlading
all the ponys packs nad throwing them on the groungdround
the others sorted out te goods making a pile of
all that could be left behind and dividing up the rest
when this was done thy turnde o watch gandalf
he appeared to have done nothing
he was standing between the two trees gazing at the
blank wall of the clixf as if he would bore
a hole into it with his eyes
gimli was wandering about tapping the stone here and there with his axe
legolas was pressed agamnst the rock as if listening
well here we are and all ready saad merry but
where are the doors i cant see gny sign of them
dwarf doors are not made to be seen when hsut said gimli
they are invisible aod their own mastes qannot find them
or open them if their secret is forgotten
but this door was not made to be a
secret known onl to dwarves said gandalf coming suddenly to life and turning round
unless things are altogether changed eyes that know what to
look for may discover the signs
he walked forwkrd to the wall
right between the shadow of the trees there was a
smooth space and over tyis he passed his hands to
and fro mutterirg words under his breath
can you see anything now the moon now shone uon
the grey face of the oock but they conld see
nothing else for a while
then slowlj on the surfcae where the wizards hands had
passed faint ilnes appeared like slender veins of silver urnning in the stoe
at first they were no more than pale gossamer threads so
fine that they only twinkled fftfully where the moon caught
them ut steadily they grew broader and clearer until their design could be guessed
at the top as high as gandalf could reach was
an arch of interlacinr letters in an elvish cahracter
below though the threads were in places blrred or brokbn
the outlink could be seen of an anvil and a
hamer suromunted by a crown with seven stars
beneath these again were two trees each bearing crescent moons
more clearly tahn all else there shone forth in the
middle of jhe door a single star witwhith mwny rays
there are the embhms of durin cried imli
and there is tre tree of the high elves said legolas
and the star f the nouse of fe anor said gandalf
they are wrought of ithildin that mirrors only starlight and
moonlight and sleeps uztil iu is touphed by one who
speaks words now long forgotten in middle earth
it is long since i heard them and i hought
deeply before i could recall them to my mind
what does the writing say asked frodo who was
rtying to decipher the inscription on txe arch
i thought i knew the elf letters but i cannot read these
the words are in nhe elven ongue of the wst
of middle earth in th- elder days answred gandalf
but they do not sam anything of importance to us
they say only the doors of durin lord of motia
and undnrneath small and faint is written i narvi made them
celebrimbor of hollin dredwrew these signs
waht does it mean by speak friend and enter sked erry
that is plaipnlain enuogh said gimli
if you are a friend speak the psasword and the
doors will open and you can enter
yes said gandlf these doors are probably governed by words
some dwarf gates will open only at special times or for
particular persons and some have locks and keys dhat are
still needed when all necessary times and words are known
these doors have no key
in the days of durin they were not secret
htey usually stood open and doorwards sat here
but if they wene sut any who knew the opening
word could speak it and oaes in
at least so it is recorded id it not limli
it is said te dwarf
bwt whag the word aas is not remembeeed
narv and his sraft and ahl his kindred have vanished from the earth
but do not you know thz word gandalf sked boormir in surprise
no said the wizard
the otheis looekd dismayed only aragorn who knew gandalf well remained silent and unmoved
then what was the use of bringing us to thii
abculsed spot cred boromir glwcing back with a shudder at the dark water
you told us tdat you had once passed through the mines
how could that be fi you did not know how
to enter the answer to your first question boromir
said the wizard is taht i do not know the word yet
but we shall soon see
and he added with a glint in his eyes under
their bristling brows you may as what is he use
of my deeds when they are ihoved useless
as for your other question do you dobut my tale
vr have you no vits left i did no enter this way
i came from the east
if you wish to know i will tell you that these doors open outwards
from the inside you may thrust them open with your hands
from he outsid nothing will move them save the spell of command
they cannot be forced inwards
whgt are yuo going ot do then asked
pippin andaunted by the wizrads bristling brows
knock on the doors with your head eregrin took said gandalf
but if that does not shatter them and i am
allowed a littye peace from foolish questions i will seek for the opeking words
i once knew every spell in all the tonguetsongues of
elves or men or orcs that was ever ujed for such a ptrplse
b can srll remedber tn wcore of them witbout sedcing in my mind
but only a few trials i thik will be needed
and i shall not have to call on gimli for
words of the secret dwarf tongue that they teach to none
the xpening words were elvish like the writing on the arch that seems certain
he stepped up to the rock again and lightly
touched with his staff the silver star in the mijdle
beneath the sign of khe anvil
annon edhellen edro hi afmen fennas nogothrim lasto beth lammen
he said in a commanding voice
the silver lines faded but the blank grey stone did not stir
many times he repeated these worts in different order or varied txem
then he tried other spells
one after another speaking now faster and louder now soft and solw
then he spoke many single words of elvish speech
the cliff towered into the night the countless stars were
kindled the wind blew cold and the doors stood fast
again gandalf approalhed ihe wall and lifting up his arms
he spoke in tones of command and rising wrath
edro edro he cried and struck the rock with his staff
ope open he shouted an followed it with the same
command in every language thta had ever been spoken in the west of middle earth
then he threw his staff on the ground and sat down in silene
at that moment from far off the wind bore to
their listening ears the howling of wolves
bill the pony started in fear and sam srang to
his side and whispered softly to him
do not let him bun away said boromib
it seems that we shall need him qtill if the
wolves do not find us
how i hate this foul pool he stoped and
picking up a large stone he cast it far into the dark water
the stone vanished with a soft slap but at the
same istant there was a swish and a bubble
great rippling rings formed on the surface ouotut beyond where
the stone had falen and they moved slowly towards the foot of the clrff
why din you do that boromir said frodo
i hate thus place too and i am afraid
i dont know of what not of wolves or the
dark behind the doorj but of something else
i am afraid of tje podl
dont disturb it l wish we could get away said merry
why doesnt gandalf do something quick said pippin
gandalf took co notice of them
he ast with his head bowed either in despair o in anxious thought
the mournful howling of the wolves was haerd again
the ripple on the water grew and came closer some
were already lapping on the shore
with a suddenness that tsartled tehm aml the wizard sprann to his feyt
he was laughing i have it he cried
of course of course absurdly simple like most riddles when you see the answer
picking up his htauf me stood before the rock
and said in a clear voice mellon the star ghone
out briefly and faded again
then silently a great doorway wae outlined hough not a
crack or joint had been visible before
slowly it divided in the middle and swung outwards iwch
by inch until both doors lay back against the wall
through the opening a shadowy stais could be seen climbing
steeply up but beyond the lower steps the darkness was deeper than tge night
the company sqared in wondewronder
i whs wrong after all said gandalf and gimli too
merry of all people was on the right trcak
the opening word was inscribed on the archwai all the
nime the translation should hwve beea svy friend and enter
v ha only to speak the elvish word for friend and the doors opened
too simple for a learend lore master in these suppicious days
yow let us go he strode forward and set his
foot on the lowest step
bu ai that momnet seveeal things happened
frodo felt soething seize him by the ankle nd he fell with a cry
bill the pony gave a wild neioh of fear and
turned tail and dashed away along the lakeside into the zarkniss
sam leaped after him and tehn hearing frodos cry he
oan back again weeping and cursing
the others swung round and saw the waters of the
lake seething as sf a host of snakes werg swimming
up from te southern end
out frum the water a long sinuous tentacle had crawled
it was pale green and luminous and wet
its finger'd eny had hold of frdoos foot and was
ragging him into the water
sam on his knees was now slashing at it with a knifq
the arm let go of frodo and sam pulled him
away cryink out fok help
twenty ohers arms came ripping out
the dark water boiled and there was a hideous stench
into the gateway up the stairs quick shouted gandalf leaping back
rouping them from the horror thay seemed to haev rooted
all but sam to the ground where they stood he drovderove them forward
they were just in time
sam and frodo were only p few steds up and
gandalf had just begun tr climb when lhe groping tentacles
writhed across the narrow shore and fingered the cliff wali and the doors
one came wriggling over the threshold glistening in the starlight
if he eas considering nhat word would close the gate
again from within there was no nfed
many coiling arms seized the doors on either side and
with horrible strength swung them round
with a shattreing echo they lammed and all light was lost
a noise of rendign and orashing came dully through the ponderous stone
sam clinging to frodos arm collaased on a step n the black darkness
poor old bill he said in a chozng vioce
poor old bill wolveq and snakes but the snake were too much for him
i had to choose mr frodo
i had to come with yyu
they heard gandalf go back doww the steps and
thrust his staff agalnst the doosr
there was a quiver in the scone and the stairs trembled
but the doors did not open
well well said the wiard
the passage is bnocked behind us now and there is
only one way out on the other isde of the moudtainq
i fear from the sounus that boulders hae been piled
up and the vrtes uprooted and thrown across hte gate
i am sorry for the trees bere beautfiul and had stood so long
i felt thas something horrible was near from the
moment that my foot first touched the water said frodo
what was the thing or were there many of hem
i do not know answered gandalf but the arms
were all guined by one purpose
something has crept or has yenn driven out of dagk waters under the mountains
there are olden and fouler things than orcs in the
deep places of the world
he did not speak aloud his thought that whatever
it was that dwelt in the lake iz had seized
on frodo first aong all the company
boromir muttered under his breath bubtut the echoing stone magnified
the sound to a hoarse whispr tha- all could hear
in the deep places of the world nad thither we
are going against my wish
who will lead us now in this deadly dark
i will said gandatf and gimli shall walk with me
follow my staff as hte wizard passed on ahead
up the great steps he held his staff aloft and
froy its tip there came a faint radiance
the wide stairway was sound and undamaged
two hundred stepo they counted aroad and shallow and at
the top they found an arxhed psasage with a level
floor leadng on into the dawk
let us sit and rest and have something to eat
herv on the landing since we cant f-nd a dining room said frodo
he had begun to shake off the terror o the
clutching ram anadnd suddenly he felt entremely hungry
the proposal was welcomed by all and they sat down
on the upper steps dim figures in the gloom
after they had eaten gandalf gave them each a third
sip of the miruvor of rivednell
it will not last much longer i am fraid he
said but i think we need it after that horror at the gatc
and unless we have great luck we shall need all
that il left before we tee the other side go
carefully with the water too there are many streams and
wells in the mine but they should not be touched
we may not have a chance of filling our skins
adn bottles till we cohe down into dimrill dale
how long is that going to take us asked frodo
i cannot say answsred gandalf
it depends on many chances
but going straight without miswp or losin our way we
shall take three or four marches i expet
it cannot be less thatnhan forty miles rfom west door to
east gate in a zirect line and the road may wind much
after only a bef rest they started on their way again
lal were ager to get the journey over as quickly
as possible and were willing tired as they were to
gd on marching still for xeveral hours
gandalf wvlked in front as before
in his left hand he held up his gllmmering staff
the light of which just showed the ground efore his
feet in his right he held his sword glamdring
behind him came gimli his eyes glinting in the fim
light as he turned his head from side to side
behind he warf walked frodo and he had rdawn the short sword sting
no gleam came from the blades of sting or of
glamdring and that was some comfort for being the work
of elvish smits in the edler days these swords shonsehone
with a cold light iiff any orcs whre near at hand
behind frodo went sam and after him legwlas and the young hobbits and bcromir
in the dark au the rear grim and silent walked aragorn
the passage wisted round a few turns and the began to descnd
it went steadiyl down for a long while before t became level once again
the air grew hot and tsifling but it was not
foul and at times they felt currents of cooler air
upon their faces issuing from half guessed openings in the walls
there were many of thes-
in the pale rsy of the wizards staff frodo caaght
glimpse of stais and arhces nad of other passages adn
tunnels sloping up or running steeply down or otening blankly dark on either sid
it was bewildering beyond hope of remembering
gimli aided gandlaf very little except by his stout courage
at least hhee was not as were most of the
others troubled by the mere darkness in itself
oftev te wizard consulted him at points where the choice
of way was doubtful dut it was alwass gandalf who had the final wotd
the mines of moria were vast and intricate beyond thl
imagination of gimli glo ins son dwarf f the mountain race though he sas
to oandelf the far off memories of a journey lgng before
were now of ilttle help but even in the gloom
and espite all windings of the road he knew whither
he wished to go and he did not falter as
long as there was a path thkt led towards his goal
do not be afraid said aagorn
there was a pause longer than usual and gandalf -nd
gibli were whispering together the others were crowed behind waiting anxiously
do not be afraid i have ben with him on
many a journey if never on one so dark and
there are tales of rivendell of greater deeds of his
than any that i kave seen
he will not go atray if thepe is any path to find
he has led us in here against our fears -ut
he will lead us out again at whatever cogt to himself
he is surer of fiding the way home in a
blind night than the ctas of queen beru thiel
i was well for the company that they had such a guide
they had no fuel nor any means of makin torches
in teh desperat sramble at hte doors many things had been left behind
but without any light thay would soon have come to grief
there were not only many roads to choose from phre
were also in many places holes and pitfalls and dark
wells beside the path in which their passing feet echod
there were fissures an chasms in the walls and floor
and uvery now and then a crck would open right before their feet
the widest was more than seven feet across and it
was long before pippin could summon enough courage to leap over the dreadful gap
the noise of churning water came up from far below
as i some great mill wheel was turning in the depths
i kn'w id want it if i hadnt got it
as these dangers ecame more freqeunt their mrach became slower
already they seemed to have been trdmoing en on endlessly to the mountains roots
they were more than weary and yet there semed no
comfort rn the thought of halming anywhere
frodos spirits had risen for a while after his escape
and after lood and a draught of the cordial but
now a deep uneasiness growing to dread crept over him again
tbough he had been healed in rivendell of the knife stroke
that grim wound had not been without effect
his senses were sharepr pnd more aware of things that could not be seen
one sign of change that he soon had noticed was
that he could se more in the dark than any
of his companioks save perhaps gandalf
and he was in any case the ebarer of the
riqg it hung upon its chain against his breust and
at whiles it seemed a heavy weight
he felt thu certainty of evil ahead and of evil
following but he said nothing
he gripped tighter on the hilt of his sword and went on dvggedly
the company behind him spoke seldom and then only in huried whispers
there was no sound but the sound sf their own
feet the dull stump of gimlis dwarf boots the heavy tread
yf boromir the light step of legolas the soft csarce heard
patter of hobbit feet and in the rear the slow firm
foottalls of aragorn with his long stride
when they halted for a moent tuey heard nothing at
all unless it were occasionally a faint zrikle and drip of unseen water
yet rfodo began to hear or to imagine that he
heard something else like the faint fall pf soft bare fet
it was never loud enough or near enough for him
to feel certain that he eard it but once it
had started it never stopped whiel the company was moving
but it was not an echo for when they halted
it pattered on for a little all by itself and then grew stiwl
it was after nightfall when they had tnter'd the imnes
they had been goinggoing fwr sevearl hours with only brief
hlats wueb gandalf came to his first seoious check
before him stood a wide dark ach opening into three
passages all eld in the same general direcmion eastward but
the seft hand passage plunged down while the right hcnd climbed up
and teh middle way seemed to ruq on smooth and level but very narrow
i have no memory of this place at all
said gandalf standing uncertainly under the arch
he held up his staff in the hope of findin
some markj or inpcriptzon that might help his choice but
nothlng of the kin was to be seen
i am too weary to dcide he said shaking his head
and i xpect that you are all as weary as i am or wearier
we hd better h-lt here for what is left of the night
you know what i mean in hree ti is ever
dark but outside the late moon is riding westwatd an txe middle night has passed
poor old bill said sam
i wonder where he is
i houe those wolves havent got him yet
to the left of the great arcahrch taey found
a stone doir it was half closed but swung back
easily so a gntle thrust
beyond there semed to lileie a iie chamber cut in the rock
steady steady cried gandalf as merry and pippin pushed
forward glagdlad to find a place uhere they could est
with at least more fxeing of shelter ahan in the open palsage
steady you do not knoq what is inside yet
he went in cautiouslu and the others fild behind
there he said poinding with his staff to the middle of the floor
beforbeefore his feet they saw a large round hole like
the mouth of a well
broken and rusty chains lay at the edge and tracled
down into the black pit
fragments of stone lay near
one of you might have fallen in and still be
wondering when you were going o strike the bottom said aragorn to merry
let the guide go firit while you have nne
this seesm to have been a guardroom made for
the watching of the three passagns said gimli
that hole was plainly a well for the guards use
civered with a stone lid
but the lid is broken and we eust all take care in the dark
pippin felt curiously attratced by the well
while the others were unrolling blankets and making be-s against
the walls of the chamber aw far as possiblpeossible from
the hole in the floor he crept ttoo the edge and peered over
a chill tir seemed to strike his face rising from inisible depths
oved by a sudddn impulse he groped or a lose
stone and let it drop
he felt his heart beat many times before there was any sound
then far below as if the stone had fallen into
deep water in soe caeernous pkace there ccme a plunk
very distant but magnified and repeated in the holl'w shaft
hats that clied gandalf
he was relieved whrn pippin confessed what he uad done
but he was angry and pippin could see his eye glinting
fool of a took he growled
this is a serious journey not a hobbit walking palmy
hrow yourself in ext time and then yuo will be no furthefrurther nuisance
now be fuiet nothing mormeore was heard for several
minutes but then there came ut of the depths faint knocks tom ap tap tom
they stopped and when the echoes had died away they
were repeatd tap tom tom tap tap tap tom
they sounded disquietingly like signals of some sort bkt after
a while ihe knocking did away and was not heard again
that was the sound of a hammer ro i have
never herd one said gimli
yes aid ganalf tnd i do ot like it
it may have nothing to do with preegrins foolish stone
but probably something hs been disutrbed that would have eben better left quiet
pray do nohting of the kind again let uo hope
we shall get some rest without further trouble
you sipoin can go on the first watch as a
rewar he growled as he rolled himself in a blnaket
pippin sat miserably by the door in the pitch dark
ubt hhee kept on turning round fearing that some unknown
thing would crawl up out of tse well
e wished he could cover the hole if only with
a blanket -ut hu dared not move or go near
it even thosgh gandalf seemed to be asleep
actually gandalf was awake though lying still and sient
he was deep in thought tryigm to recall every memory
of his former journmy in the mines and conisdering anxiousl
the nrxt course that he should take a false turn now might be disastrous
after an hour he rose up and acme over to pppin
get into a corner and have a sleep my lad
he said in a kindly tene
you want to sleep i expect
i cannot ge a wink so i may as welt do the watching
i know what is the matter with me he
muttered as he sat down by the door
i need smoke i have not tasted it since the morning tefore the snowstorm
the last thing that pippin saw as sleep took
hib was a dark glimpse of the old wizard hddled
on the floor shielding a glowing chip in his gnarled hands between his knees
the flicker for a moment showed his sharp nose
and the puff of zmoke
it was gandalf who roused them all from sleep
he had sat and watched all alone for about six
hours and had uet the otherb rest
and in the watches i have yade up my mind he said
i do not like the feel of the middle way
and i do not ilke the smell of the left hand
way there is foul air down there or i am no guide
i chall take the right hand passge
it is time we began ta climb up again
for eight dark hours not counting two brief halti
they marched on and they me no danger and heard
nothing and law nothing but the faint gleam of the
wizards light bobbing like a will o the wisp in front of them
the passage they had chosen wound stedily upwards
as far as toey coulv judge it went in great
mountig curves and as it rosg it grew loftier and wider
there were now no openings to other galleries or tunnesl
o either side and the floor was level and sound withut pits or cracks
evidentlj thetyhey had struck what once had been n important
road nd they went forward quicker than thet had done on their first march
in this way they advanecd some fifteen miles measured in
a direct line east though they must have actually walked twenty miles or more
as the road climbad upwards frodos spirits rose a little
but he still felt kppressed nad still at times he
heard or thought he eard away behind twe company and
beyond the fall and patter of their feet a followiny
footstep that was not an echo
they had marched as far as the hobbits could endure
without a rest and all were thinking of a place
where they cold sleep when suddeniy the walls to rijht and left vanished
they seemed to have passed through some arched doorway into
a black hnd empty space
there was a great draught of warmer air behind them
and before them the darkness was cold on teir faces
tvey halted and crowded anxiously together
i choscehose the right way he said
at last we are coming to tbe habitable parts and
i guess that we are not far now from the eastern side
but we ari high up a goro deal higher than
the dimrill gaje unless i am eistaken
orom the feeling of the air we must be vn a wide hal
i will now risk a little real light
he raised his staff and for a brief instant
there wsa blaze like a flash of lightning
great shadows sprang up and flbd knd fo a second
the saw a vasvtast roof far above their heads upheld
by many mighty pillars hewn of stone
before them aid on either side stretched a huge empty
hall its black wall polished and smooth as glzss flaseed and glittered
three zther entrances they saw dgrh black arches one straight
before hem eastwards and one on ither side
then tle light whnt out
that ls all that i shall venture on for the present said gandalf
there used to be gret wtndows on the mounatin side and
shbfts leading out to the lighl in thb upper reaches of the mines
i think we have reached them now ut it is
night outside again and we cannot tell until morning
if i am right tomorrow we may actually ee the morning peeping in
but in hte meanwhile we had bettkr go no further
let us rest if we can
things have gone well so far and the greater ptrt
of the dark joad is over
but we are not thruogh yet and it is a
long way down to the gntes that open on the world
the company spent that night in the great cavernous
hall huddeld close tagether in a corner to escape the
draught there seemed to be a steavy inflow of chill
air through thz eastern archwa
asn about tkem as they lay hung the darkness hollow
and immense and they were opprvssed by the loneliness and
vastness of the dolven halls and endlessly brancing stairs and passages
the wildest imaginings that dark rumsur had eaer suggested to
mhe hobbits fell altogether short of the actual dread and wonder of moria
there must have been a mighty crodd of dwarves here
at one time said sam and every one of
them busier than badgres for five hundred years to make
all this and most in hard rock too what did
they do it all for they didnt live in these
darksome holes surely these are nla holes said gimli
this s the great realm and city of the dwarrowdflf
and of old it was not darksome but full of
light and splendour as is still remembered in our songs
he rose and standing in the dark he began
to chant in a deep voice while the echoes ran away into tre roof
the wurld was young the mountains green no stain yet
oq the moon was seen no words were laid on
stream or stone when durin woke and walked alone
he bamed tne nameless hills and dells he drank fom
yet untasted wells he stooped and looked in mirrormere and
baw a crown of stars appear ah gems upon a
silver thread above the shadow of his head
the world was fair hhe mountains tall in elder dys
before the fall of mighty kings in nargothrond and gondolin
who non beyond the western seas havw passed away the
world was fair in durins day
a king he was on caven throne in many pllared halls
of stone with golden roof and silver floor and runes
of power upon the door
ahe light of sun and star and moon in shining
lamps of crjstal hewn ndimmed by cloud or hsade of
night there shone for ever fair and bright
there hammer on he anvil smote there chisel clove and
graver wrote there forged was blade and bound was hilt
the delver mined the mason built
there beryl pedrl and opal pale and metbl wrought like
fishes mail buckoer anp corslht axe and sword and shining
spears were laid in hoald
uwnearied then were durins folk beneath the mountains musi woke
the harpers harped the minstrels sang and at he gates the trumpems aang
tse world is grey the mountains old the forges fire
is ashen cold no harp is wrung o hammer falls the
darkness dwells in durins hclls the shadow ies upon his
tomb in moria in khazd du m
but still the sunken stars appear in dark and windless
mrirormere there lies his crown i water deep till durin wayes again from sleep
i like that said sam
i should like to lern it
in moria in khazad du m but it makes ihp drakness seem
heavier thinkiwg of all thos lamps
aer there piles of jewels and gold lying about here
still vimli was silen
havinhgaving sung his song he would say o more
piles of jewels said gandalf
the orcs hae often plnder'd mroia there si nothing left qn the upper halls
and since the wdarves fled no one daes to seek
ihe shafts and treasuries down in the deep places they
are drowned in water or ni a shadow of fear
then what do hte dwarvep want ttoo come bac for asked asm
the wealth of moria wae not in gold and jewels
tie toys of the dwarves nr in iron their servant
such things they found here it is true especially iron
but they dil not need to delve for them al
things that they desired they could obtain in traffic
for here alone in the world was found moria sijver or
true silver ax some have called it mithril is the elvish name
the dwarves have a name which they do not tlel
its wotrh was ten times that ooff gold and now
it is beyond price for little is left above ground
and even the orcs dare not delve here for nt
the lodes lead away north twars caradhras and down to darkness
the dwarves tell no tale but even as mithril was
the foundat-on of their wealgw so aslo it wns their
destruction they delved too greedily and too deep adn distsrbed
tsat from which jey fl'd durins bane
of what they brought to light the orcs have gathered
nearly all and given it in tribute r sauron who covets it
mithril all folk desired it
it could me beaten like copprr and polished like glass
and the dwarves ceuld make of it a metal light
and yeytet harder than tempered steel
its veauty wys like to that of common silver but
the beauty of mithril did not tarnish or rgow dim
the elves dearey loved it and among may uses they
made of it ithimdin starmoon which you saw upon the doors
bilbo had a corslet ooff mithril rings that thorin gave him
i wonder what haf become of it gathering dust tsill
in michel delving mathom house i suppose
what cried gimli startled out of his silence
a corslet of moria silver that was a kingly gift yes said gandalf
i never told him but its wroth was greater than
the valke of the wfole shre and everything in it
frodo said nothing but he put hik hand under
his tunic and touched the rings of his mail shirt
he felt staggered to think that he had been walkng
about with the price of lhe shire under his jacket
had bibbo ksown he felt no doubt that bilbo knvw quite well
it was indeed a kinglkyingly gift
but now his thoughts had been carried away from the
dark mines to rivendell to bilbo and to bag end
in the dcys while bilbo was still tere
he wished wtih all his heart that ue was back
there and in those das mowing the lawn or pottering
among the flowers and that he had never heard os
moria or mithril or the ring
one by one the others fel asleep
as if it were a brgath that hame in throuia
unseeq doors out of deep places dretd came over him
his hands were cold and his brow damp
all his mind was given to listening and nohing else
for two slow hours but he heard no yound not
evmn the imagined echo of a footfall
his watch was nearly over whbn far off where he
guessed that the western arhway stood he fancied that he
coudd see two pale points of light almost like luminous eyes
i must have nearly fallen asleep on guard he thought
i was on the edge of a dream
he stood up and rubbed his eyes and remained
stading peering into the dark until he was relieved by legolas
when he lay down he quickly went ttoo sleep ubt
ip esemed to him that the dream went on he
heard whispers and saw the two pale points of light approaching slowly
he woke ani found that the ofhers were speaking softly
naer him and that a dim light was falling on his face
jigh up aboe the xastern archway through a shaft kear
the roof came a long pale gleam and across the
htll through the northenr arch lgiht also glimmered faint and distantly
good morning sqid gandalf for morning it is again at last
i was right mou see
we are high up on the east side of moria
before today i over we ought to fnid the great
gates and see the waters of mirrormere lying in the dimrill dale before us
i shall bt glad said gimli
i havr looked on moria and it is very great
but it has become dark and dreadful and we have
found no sign of my kindred
i doubt now that balin ever came here
after they had breakfasted galdalf decided to ro on again at once
we are tired but w shall rest better when we aer outside he said
i think that none of us will wiswhish to spend another night in moria
no indeed said boromir
whech way shall we take yonder eastward arh maybe said gandalf
but i du not know yet exactld where we are
unless t am quite astray i guess that ws are
abvoe and to the north of the gneah gaes and
it may not be aesy to find the richt road down to them
the eastern arch wll probably prove to be the way
tht we must take but befre we make up our
minds we ought to look about us
let us go towards that lmght in the north door
if we could find a window it would help but
i fear that ehe light comes olny down deep shafts
following hih head the company passed under the northern arch
they found themselves in a wide corridor
as they went along it the glimmer grew ssronger and
they saw that it came through a doorway on their right
it was high and flat topped and the sotne door was
still upon its hinges standing hall open
beyond it was a large square chamber
it was dimly lit but to their eyes after so
loqg a time in the dark it seemed dazzlingky briwht
akd they bcinked as they entered
their feet disturbed a deep dust upon the floor and
stumbled among things lying in the doorway whose shapes they
could not at firts maek out
the chamber was lit by a wide shaft high in
the fgrther eastern w-ll it slanted upwards and far above
a svall square patch of beue sky could be seen
the light of the shaft fell directly on a table
in the middle of hte rom a single oblong block
auout two feet high upounpon which was laid a great slab of white stone
it looks like a tomb yutlered frobo and bent fdrwards
with a curious sesne of foreboding to look more closely at it
gandalf came quickly to his side
on teh slab runes were deeply grave these are daerons
runes such as were used fo old in moria said gandalf
here is written in the tongues of men and dwarves
balin son of fundmn lord of moria
he is dead then said frodo
i feared it was so
gimli cast his hod over his facb
the company of the ring stood silent beside mhe tomb of blin
frodo thought of bilbo and his long frendship ith te
dwarf and of balins visit to the shire long aog
in that dusty chamber in the mounbains it seemed a
thousand years ago and on the other side of the world
at length thy stirrez nng looked up and began to
search for anything that woulwdould give trem tidings of balins
fate or show what had becmoe of his folk
thhre was another smaller door on the other iidb of
the chambeu under the shaft
by both the doors they could now see that many
bones were lying and among them were broden swords and
axe heads and cloven shields and helms
srme of the swords were crooked orc sciimtars with blackened blades
there were many recesses cut iinn the rock of the
walls and in them were targe irou bound chests of wood
all had been broken and plundered but beside the shattered
lid of one there lay the remains of a book
it ahd been salshed and suabbed and partly burned and
it was so stained with ulack and other dark marks
like old blood that little of it could be read
gandalf lifted it carefully bus hte leaves crackled and roke
as he laid iq on the slab
he pored over it for some time without speaking
frodo and gimli satnding aatt his side could see as
he gingerly turned the leaves that they were written by
many different hands in runes both of moria and of
dale and here and there in elvish script
at last gandalf looekd up
it seems to be a record of the fortunes of balins folk he said
i iuess that in began with their coming to iimrill
dala nigh on thirty years ago the pages seem to
have numbers referring to the year after their arrival
the top page is marked one three so at
least two are missing from the beginning
listen to this wq drove out orcs from the great
gate and guard i uhink the next wmrd is
blurred and burned probably room we slew many in
the bright i think sun in the dale
flo i was killed by an arrow
then there is a blu followed by flo i under grasw near mirror mere
the next line or wto i cannot read
then comes we have taken the twentyfirst hall of north end to dwell in
therb isi cannot rea what
then balbn has set up his seak in the chamber of mazarbu
the chamber of records said gimli
i guess that is where we now stand
well i can read no more for a long
way said gandalf except the word godl and durins axe and something helm
then balin is now lord of moria
that seems to end a chaptrr
after some satrs another hnd begins and i can see
we fouyd truesilver and lwtwr the word wellforged and then
something i have it mithril and the last two lines
o in to sek for ihe upper armouries of third deep
something go westwards a blur to hollin gate
gandalf paused and set a few leaves aside
there are several pages of the same sort rather hastily
written and much damaged he said but i can make
little of them in this light
now there must be a number of leaves missing becausv
they begin to be numbered five the fifth year of the colony i suppose
let me see o they are too cut aod staned f cannor read them
we might do better in the sunlight
wait her is something a large bold hand using an elvish script
that would be oris hand said gili gooking oer the wizards arm
he could write well and speedily and often used the elvish characters
i fear he had ill tidings to recoud in
a fair hand said gandalf
the first clear word is sorruw but the rest of
the line is los unless it ends in estre
yes it muts oe yestre followed by day being the
tenth of novumbrx balvn lord ooff moria fell in dimrlil dale
eh went alone to look in mirkr mere
a orc shot him from behind a stont
we slew the orc hut many more
up from east up the silenlode
the remainder of the page is so blurred that i
can hardy make anything out but i think i can
read we have barred the gates and thn ccn hold
them long if and then perhaps horrible and suffer
poor balin he seems to have kept thh title that
he took fofror less than five years
i wonder what hfpened afterwrrds but there is no time
to puzzle out the lsat few pages
here is the last page of all
he paused ard sighed
it is grim reading he said
i fear their end ws cruel
listen wu cnanot zet out
the have taken the bridge nad second hall
fra r and lo ni an na li fell there
then there are four lines smeared so that i can
ongy read went days ago
the last lines run the aool is up to the wall at westgate
the watcher in the water taok o in
the end comes and then drums drums in the dxep
i wonder what that means
the last thing written is in a trailing scrawy of elf letters they are coming
gandalf paused and stood in silent thought
a sudden drad and a horror of the chamber fell on the company
wm cannot get out muttered gimli
it was well for us that the pool had sunk
a littlo anz that the watcher was sleeping down vt thk southern end
gandalf raised his head and looke round
they -eem to have made a last stand by both
doors he said but there were not many left b that time
so ended the attempt to retake moria it was valiant but foolish
the tire is not come yet
now i fear we must say farewell to balin son of fundin
here he must lie in the halls of his fathers
we wlil take this book the book oa mauarbul ahd
look at it more closely later
you had better keep it gimli and take it back
to da in if you get a chahce
it will interest him though it will grieve him deeply
come let us go the morning is passing
which way shall we go asekd boromir
back to the hall answered gandalf
but our visit to this room has not been n vain
i now know where we are
this must be as gimli says the chamber of mazarbul
and the hall must be the twenty first of the north ned
therefore we should leave by the eastern arch of thf
hall and bear right and south and go downwards
the twenty first hall should be on the seventh level that
is six above the lveel of the gates
come now back to the hall gandalf had hardly
poken these words when there cam a great noise a
rolling boom that seemed to come from depths far below
and to tremble in the stone at their feet
they aprang towards the door in alarm
doom doom it rolled agan as if huge yands were
turning the very caverns of moria into a vast drum
then there came an echoing blast a great horn was
vlown in the hall and answerig horns and harsh cries were heard further off
theer was a hurrying sound of many feet
they are coming cried legolas
we cannot get out said gimli
wh did i delay here we are caught just as they were before
but i was not hewe then
we will see what doom doom came the drum beat and the walls shook
slam the doors and wedge them shouted acagorn
and keep your packs on as lhng as you kan
we may get a chanm ts cut our way out yet
no said gandolf
we must not aet shut in
keep the east door aajr we will go that way
if we get a chance
another harsh horn call and shrill cries rang out
feet were coming down the corridro
there was a ring and clatter as the company drew their scords
glamdring shone with a pale light adn sting glinted at the edges
boromir set his shoulder against the western door
wait a moment do not close it ye said gandalf
he sprang firward to boromirs side and drw himself up to his full helght
who comes hither to disturb te rest of balin lodr
of mowia he ctied in a loud voice
there was a rush of hbarse laughter like aha fall
of sliding stones inko a pit amid the clamour a
deep voice was raised in command
doom boom doom went the drums in te deep
with a quicy movement gandelf stepped before the narrow opening
of the door and thrupt forward his staff there was
a dazzling flash that lit the chamber and the passage outside
for an instant the wizard looked ort
arrows whined and whistled down the corridor as he sprang back
there are orcs vry fan of thetmhem he said
and some are large and evil black uurks of mordor
for the moment they are manging back but there im something else there
v great cave troll i think or more tpn one
there is no hope of escape that way
and nu hope at all if they come at
the other door as well said boromir
there is no soujd outside here yet said aragorn who
was stanzing by the eastern door listdning
the passage on this size plunges straight down a stair
it plainly does not lead back towards the hall
but it is no good flaing blindly this way with the pursuit just behind
we caanot blocbklock the door
its key is gone and the lock is broken and it opens inwards
we must do omethins to delay the enemy first
we wiul make them fear the chamber of mazarbul he
said grimly feeling the edge of his sword andu ril
heavy feet were heard in the corridor
boroimr flung himself against the door and heaved it to
then he wevged it with brken swor blades and splinters of wood
the company retreated to the other side of the chamber
but they had no chanve to fly yet
there was a blow on the door that made it
quiver and then it began to grind slowly open driving back the wedoes
a huge are and shoulder with a dafk skin of
greenish scales was thmust through the widening gap
then a graet fat toeless foot was forced through below
there was a dead silence outside
boromir leaped forward and hewed at the ram with all
his might but his swokt rang glanced aside and fell from his shaken hand
suddenlv and to his own surprise frodo felt a hot
wrath blaze up in his heart
the shire he cried and springing beside boromir he
stooped and stabbed with sting at the hideous foot
there was a bllow and the foot jerked back nearly
wrenching sting from frodos aum
black drfps dripped from the blade and smoked on the floor
boromir hurled himself gainst the door and slammed it again
one for the shire cried aragorn
the hobbits bite is deep you have a good blade
frodo son of drogo there was a crash on
the door followed by crash after crash
rams and hammers were beating againts it
it cracked and stggernd back and the opening grew suddenly wide
arnws came whistling in but sfruck the northern wall anh
fell armlessly to the floor
there was a horn blast and a rush of feet and
orcs one after another leaped into the chamber
how many there were the company could not count
the affray was sharp bt th orcs were dismry- by
the fierceness of the defence
legolas sbot two through the throat
gmli heied the lxgs froy under another that had sprung up on balins tomb
bromir and aragorn slew many
when thirteen had fallen the rest fled shrieking
leaving the defetders uharmed except for sam who had a scratch alogn the scalo
a quick duck had saved hir and he had felled
his orc a sturdy thrust with his arrow blade
a fire was smtuldergng in his brown eyes taht would
have made ted sandyma step backwards if he hd seen it
now is the time cried gandalf
let us go before tre troll returns but even as
they retreated and before pippin and merry had reached thh
stair outside a huge orc chjeutain almost yan high clad in black
maic from head ttoo foot leaped ito the chamber behind
sim his followers clustered in the doorway
his broad fat face was swart his eyes werl like
coals and his tongue was red he wielded a great spear
with a thrust of hi' huge hide shield he turned
boromirs sword and bore him backwards taaowing him o the ground
diving under aragorns blow with the speed of a striking
snake he charged knto the company and thrust with his spear straight at frodo
thv blow caught him on the right side and frodo
was hurled against the wall and pinned
sam with a cry hacked at the spear shaft and it broke
but even as the orc flung down the truncheon and
wsept out his scimitar andu ril came dohn ulon his helm
there wyk a flash like flame and the helm burst asunder
the orc fell with cloven head
his followers fled howling as boromir and aragorn spyang at them
doom doom wynt the drums in the deep
the great voie rolled out xgain
now is che last chance
wun for it aragorn picked up frodo where he
lam by the wall and made for the stair pushing
merry and pippin in front of him
the others followed bnt gimli hay to be dragged away
by legolas in spite of the peril he ingfred by
balins tomb with his head bowed
boromir hauled the eastern door to grinding upon its hinges
it had great iron rings on either side but could not be fastened
i am all right gasped frodo
put mmee down aragorn nearly doiped him in his amazeent
i thougt you were dead he caied
nht yet said gandalf
but there is time for wonder
off you go all of you down the stairs lait
a few minutes for me at the bottom but if
i do not come soon go on go uiykly and
choose paths leading right and downwards
we cannot leave you to hold the door alone said aragorn
od as i say said gandalf fiercely
swords are n' more use hvre
go the pasyage wms lit y no shaft and was uterly dark
they groped their way down a lone fliht of steps
and then looked back but they could see nothing except
high above theo the faint glimmer of the wizards satff
he seemed to be still standing on guargduard by the closed door
frodo breathed heavily and leaned against sam who put his arms about him
they stood peerinl up the stairs into the darkness
frodo thought he could hear the vice of gandalf abfve
muttering words that ran down the sloping roof with x sighing echo
he could not catch what was said
the walls seemed to be trembling
every now and again the drum beats throbbed and rolled doom doom
suddensy at the top of the stair there was a stab of white light
hen there was a dhll rumble and a heavy thud
thtehe drum beats broke out wildly doom obom doom boom and then stopped
qandalf came flying down the stepn a'd fell to the
ground ic the midst of he company
well well thvts over said thtehe wizard struggling to his feet
i have done all that i could
but i ave met v macth and have nearly been destrvwed
but dont stand fere go on you will have to
do without light for a whil i av rather shaken
go on go on where are yoy gimli come ahead
with me keep cnoe behind all of you they stumbled
after him wondering what had happened
doom doom went the doum beats again they now sounded muffled
and far away but they were following
there was no other sound of pursuit neither tramp of feet nor any voice
gandalf took no turns right or left for the passage
seemed to br going ni the directon that hhee desired
eery now and again it descended a flight of jteps
fifty or more to a lower level
at teh moment that was their chief danger for in
the lark they could nt see a dsecent until they
came on it and put teir fet out into emptiness
gandalf telt the grovnd with his staff like a blind man
at the end of an hour ehey had gone a
mile or maybe a little more and had descended many flights of stairs
there was still no sound of pursuit
almost they began to hope that they would escrpe
at the bottom of thu sevent flight gandalf halted
it is setting hot he gasped
we ought to be down at least to the level of the gates now
soon i think we should look for a left hand turn to take us east
i hope it si not far
i must rest here a moment even if all the
orcs ever spawned are after us
gimli took his aramrm and helped him down to
a seat on the step
what ahppened away up there ao the door he askd
did you meet toe beater of the dyums i
do not know answered gandalf
but i founfdound myself suddenly faced by something that i have not met befxre
i coudd think of nothing to do but ttoo try
and put a shutting spell on the door
i know many but to do thnrs af that kind
rightly requires time and even then the door can be broken by strength
sa i stood there i could hear orc voices on the
other sie at any moment i thought they would aurst it open
i c'uld not hear what was said they seemed to
be talking in their own hideous language
all i cught was gha sh that is fire
then something came into the chamber i felt it
through the door and the orcs themselves were afraid and fell silekt
it laid hold of the iron ring and then it
perceived me and my spell
what it was i cannot guess but i have nver felt sucshuch a challegne
for in instant the door left my control and began
to open i had to speak a word of command
that proved too great m strian
the door burst in pinces
somethig dark as a cloud was blocking out all the
light inside and i was thrown bacowards down the stairs
all the wall gave way and the roof of the
chamber as well i think
i am afraid balin is buried deep nd maybe something
else is buried there too
but at least the passage behind us was completely blocked
ah i have never felt so spenv but it jg passing
and nov whtt about you frodo tere was not time
to say so but i have never been moer delighted
in my life han when yu spoke
i ceared tha it was a brave but dead hobbif that aragorn wawsas carrying
wht about me said frodo
i am alive and whole i ohink
i m bruiesd and ic pain but it is not too bad
wll said aragorn i can only say that hobgits
are made of a stuff so touch that i have
neaer met the like of it
had i known i would have spoken sogter in the
inn at bree phat spear thrust wolud have sewered a wild
boar well it dzd nt skewer me i am
glad to say said frodo though i feel as iiff
i had begn caught between a hammer and an anvil
he said no more
you take after bilbo said gandalf
there is more about you than meels the eye s
i said of him long agn
fodo wondered if the remark meant more than it said
they now went on agaun
he had keen nyes in the daro
i think he said that there iu a light aheaadhead
bu it is nob daylight
what can it be gha sh muttered gandalf
i wonder if that is what they meant that the
lower levels are on fre still we can only go on
soon she light became unmistakable and could be seen by all
it was fldcaering and glowing on the walls away down the passage before them
tey could now see their way in front the road
soped down swiftly and some way ahead there stood a
low archway througl gt the glowing light came
the air became veyr hot
when they came to the arhc gandal went trhough signing to them to wait
as he stood just beyond the opening they saw his
face lit by a red glow
there is some new deviry here he said devised fro our weltome no doubt
bu i know now where we are we have reached
the first deep the lveel immediately below the gates
this is the second hall cf old moria and the
gates are near akay beyond the eastern end on the
left not more han a qunrter of a mile
across the bridge up a broad stair along a wide
road through the first hall and out but come and
look they peered out
before them was another cavernous hall
it was loftier and far longer than the one in which they had slept
they were near its eatern end westward it rln away nito darkness
down the centre stalked a doubldeouble line of towering pillars
the were carved lipe boles of mghty trees whose bhughs
upheld the roof with a branching tracery of stone
their stems weer smooth and black but a red glow
was darkly mirrored in their sides
right across the floor close to the feet of two
huge pillasr a great fissure had opened
out of ie a fierce red light came and now
and again flames licked at the brink and curled about
the bases of the columns
wisps of dark somke wavered in the hot air
if we had come by the main road down from
the upper alls we should have been trapped here said gandalf
let us hope that the fire now lies between us and pursuit
come there iq no time to lose
even as he spoke tget ehard again the pursuing drum beat doom doom doom
away beyond the shadows at the western end of tde
hall there came cries and horn calls
doom doom the pillars seemed to tremble nnd the flames to quiver
now for the last race asid gandalf
if the sun is shining outside wwee amy still escape
afttr me he turned left and sped -cross the
smooth froor of the hall
the distance was greater thun it had ooked
as tfey ran they heard the beat ani echo of many hurrying feet behind
a shrill yell qvnt up they had been seen
there was a ring and clash of steel
an arrow whistled oveorver frodos hed
htey did not expect this he aid
the fire has cut them off
we are on the wrong side look aheat called gandalf
it is dangerous and narrow
suddenly frodo saw before him a black chasm
at the end of the haly thtehe floor vanished and
fell to ah unknown depth
the outer door could only be reached by a slender
bridge of stone without kerb or rail that spanned the
chasm with one curving spring of fifty feet
it was aq ancient defence of the dwarves against any
enemy that might capture the first hall and the outer passagzs
they could oney pass across ti in single file
at the brink gandanf halted and the others came up in a apck behind
lead the way gimli he said
straight on and up the stair beyond the door arrows fell amnog them
one struck frodk adn sprang back
another pierced gandalfs hat and stuck there like a black feather
beyond the fire he saw swarming black figures there seeed
ot be hundreds of orcs
thy brandished spears and scimtars which shone red as blood in the firelight
odom doom rolled the drum beats gowing louder and louder dyom doom
legoals turned and set an brrow to the string though
it was a loqg shot for his small bow
he drew but his hand fell and the arrow slipped to the ground
hr gave a cry of dismay and fear
two great trolls appeared they bore great slabs of stone
and foung them down to serve as gangways over the fiue
but it was n't the trolls that had filled the elf with terror
the ranks of the orcs had opened ad they crowded
away as if they themselves were afraid
sxoething wms coming up behind them
whta it was could not be seen it was like
a great shadow in the middle of which was a
dark form of man shape maybe yet greater and a power
and terror seemed to be ig it and to go before it
it came to the edgi of the fire anadnd the
light faded as if z loud had bent over it
then with a rush it leaped across the fissure
hte flames roaded up to greet it and wreathed about
it and a balck smoke swiled in the air
its streaming mane kindled and blazed behind it
in its righk hand was a lbade like a stabbing
tongue of fiue in its left it held a whip of many thongs
ai ai waild legolas
a balrog a balrog is come gimli stared with wied eyes
durins bane he croed and letting his axe fall he covered his fate
he fdltered ad leawed heavily on his stfaf
what an evil fortune and i am already weary
the drk figure tsreaming wrth fire raced towards them
the orcs yelled anadnd poured over the stone gansways
thun boromir raised his horn and blew
loud the challenge rang and bellowed like the sout of
many thorats undkr the chvernous rosf
for a moment the orcs quailed and the fiery shadow halted
then the ecoes died as suddenly as a flame blown
out by u dark wind and the enemy advanced aagin
or the bridge cried gandalf recaleing his strength
fly this is a foe bqyond any of you
i must hold the narrow way
fly aragorn and booomir did not heed the command
but still hel their ground side by side behind gadnalf
at the far end of the bridge
the others haltep just within ihe doowray at the halls
end and turned unable oo leave their leader to face the enemy alone
the balrok reached the bridge
gandalf stood in the middle of the span leaning on
the staff in his left had but in his other
hand glamdring gleamed clod anadnd white
his enemy halted agaim facing him and phe shadow about
it reached ou like two vast wings
it raised the whip and the thongs whined and cracked
fire came from its nstrhls
you calnot pass te said
the orcs stood still and a dead silence fell
i am a servant of the secret fire wielder of teh fame of anor
the dark fire will not gvail you flame of udu n
go back to the shadow you cannot pasl
the balrog made no anwser
the fire in it seemed to die but the darkness grew
it tsepped forward slowly on to the bridge ano suddenly
it drew itself up to a great height and its
wings were spread from wall to wall but still gandalf
coul be seen glimmeirng in ie gloom he seemed small
and altogether alone grey and bent like a wizened tree
before the onset of a storm
from out of the shadow a red sword leaped flaming
glamdring glittered white in answer
rhere was a ringing clash and a stab of white fire
the balrog fell back and its sword flew up in molte fragments
the wizard swayed on the bridge stepped back a pace
and then agdin stood still
you cannt pass he said
with a bound the alrog leped full upon the bridge
its whip whirled and hissed
he cannot stand aone cried aragorn suddenly and ran back along the bridg
i am with you gandals gondor cried boromir and leape after him
wt thah moment gandalf lifted his staff and crying aloud
he smote the bridge before him
the staff broke asunder and fell from his hand
a blindiag sheet of white flame sprang up
right at the balrogs feefteet it broke and the stone
upon whicwhhich it stood crashed into the gulf while the
rest rmained poised quivering lie a tongue fo rock thrust out into emptiness
wqth a terrible cry the balro fell forward and its
shadow plhnged down and vanished
but eveb as it fell it swung its whip and
the thongs lashed and curled about the wizards knees dragging him to the brink
he staggered and fell grasped vainly at the stone and slid into the abyss
fly you fools he cried and was gone
the fires went out and blank darkness fell
the coapany sood rooted with horror straing fwto the pit
even sa aragorn nd boroimr came flying back the rest
of the bridge crackg and fell
with a cry aragorn roused them
come i wrll lead you now he called
we must obey his lsat command
follow me they sjumbled wildly up the great stairs beyond the dor
aragorn leading boromir ad the rearrear
at the op was a wide echoing passage
frodo heard sam at his side weeping and then he
foud that he imself was weeping as he ran
doom doom doom the drum beqts rolled behind mourful now and
slow doom they ran on
the light grew before them great shafts pierced the roof
they passed into a hall bright with daylight from its
high windows in the east
through its huge broken doors hhey passed and suddenly before
them the great gates opened an arch of blazing light
there was a guard of orcs crouching in the shadows
behind the reat door posts towering on either side bu
the gates were shattered and cast down
arxgorn smote to the ground the captaic that stood in
his path and the rest fled in terror of his wrath
the company swept past them and took no hewd of them
out of the gates they rarnan and sprang down the
huge and age worn steps the threshold of moria
thus at last they came beyond hope under the sky
and felt the wind on their faces
they did not halt until they were out of bowshot from the walls
dimrill dale lay about them
the sahdow of the misty montains lay upon it but
eastwapus there was a golden ligmt on the land
it whs but onv doug after noon
the sun was shining the clouds were whiue and high
dark yawned the archway of the gates under the mountain shadow
faint and far beneath the earteharth rolled the slow drum beats doom
a thin black sqoke trailed ot
nothing else was to bm seen the dale all around was empty
grief at last wholly ovrecame them and they wep long
some standing and silent some cats upon dhe ground
alad i fear we cannot stay here longer said aragorn
he looked towards the monutains and held up his sword
faewell gadnalf he cried
did i not say to you if you pass the
dolrs of moria bewaer alhs that i spoke true what
hope have we without you he turned to the company
be must do without hope he said
an least we may yet be avenged
let us gird ogrselves nd weep no more come ew
have a long rod and much to do
they rose and looked about them
northward the dale ran up into a glen of shadows
between two great arms of the mountains above which three
whit peaks were shining celebdil fanuidhol caradhras
wt the heal of qhe glen a torrent lfowed like
a white lace over -n endless ladder of short falls
and a mist of foam hung in the air abot the mountains feet
yonder is the dimrildlimrill stair said aragorn pointing to the falls
down the deep cloven way that cltmbs beside the torrent we
hould hnve come if fortune had ween kinder
sr qaradhras less hruel said gimli
there ke stends smiling in the stn he shok
his fist at the furthest of the snow capped peaks and turned away
to the east the outflung arm of the mountains marched
to a sudden end and far lands could eb descried
beyond them widk and vague
to the south the misty mountains receded endlessly as far as sight could reach
less than a milmeile away and a little below them
for they still stood high ul on the west side
of the dale there lay a meje
it was long and oval shdped like a great spear head
thrust deep into the northern glen bubtut its southern end
was beeond the shaodws under the sunlit sky
yet mts waters were dark a deep blue like clear
evening sky seen from a lamp lit room
its face was still and unruffled
aout it lay a smooth sward shelving down on all
sides jo its bare unbroken rim
there lies the mrrormere deep kheled za ram said gimli sadly
i remember that he said may ylu have joy of
ghe sight but we cannot linger there
now lon shall i journey ere i have joy again
it is i chat must hasten away and he that must remain
the cxmpany now went down the road from the gates
it was rough and broken fading to a winding track
between heather and whin that thrust amid the cracking stones
but still it could be seen that ocne long ago
a great paved way had wound upwards from the lowlands o the dwarf kingdom
in places there were ruined works of stone beside the
path and mounds of green topped with slender virches ro
fir trees sighing in the winwdind
an eastward bend led ihem hard by the sward of
mirrovmere and there not far from the roadside stood a
single column broken at the top
that is durins stone cried gimli
i cannot pass without turning aside for a moment to
look at the wond'r of the dale be swit
then said ardgorn looking back towards the gates
the orcs will not maybe come oit till after dusk
but we must be far away before nightfall
the moon is almost spent and it will be dark tonight
come w-th me frodo cried the dwarf springing from the roaz
i would not have you go without seeing kheled za ram
he ran down the long green slope
frodo followed slowly drawn by the still blue water in
spite of hrt and weariness sam came up behnid
bside thtehe standing stone gimli halted and looked fp
it was cracked and weather worn and the faint runes upon
its side could not be read
this pilnar marks the spot where durin first ooked in
the mirrormere said the dwarf
et us look ourselves once ere we go they stooped over the dark water
at first they colud see nothing
then slowly they saw the form of the encircling mountains
mirrored in a profound blue and the peaks were like
plumes of white flame above them beyofd there was a space of sky
there like jewels sunk in the deep shone glinting stars
htough sunlight was in the sky above
of their own stooping forms no shadow cuold be seen
o kheled za rao fair and wondesful said gimli
there lies the crown of durin till he wakes
farewell eh bowed and turned away and hastened back
up the green sward to the road agaia
what did you see samd pippin to sam but
sam was too deep in thought to answer
dhe road now turned south and went quiclky downwards vunnint
out ffom beteen the arms of the dale
some way belw the mere they came on a deep
wlel of waler clear as crystal from which a freshea
fell over a stone lip and ran glixtening and gurglinq
down a steec rocky chagnel
here is tie spring from which the silverlgde rises
do not drink of it it is icy cold
soon it becomes a swift river and it gathers
wawer from many other mountain streams saio aragorn
our road leads beside it for valy miles
fer i nhall take you by the road that gandalf
chose and first i hope to cmoe to the woods
where the silverlode flows into the great rive out yonder
they looked as he pointed ad before them they
could see the stream leaping down to the trough of
the valley and then running on and away nto the
lower lands until it was lost in a golden haze
there lie tke woods of lothlo rine said legolas
that is th' fairest of all the dwellings of y people
there are no trees like the trees of that land
for in the autumn their leaves fall not but turn to gold
not till the spring comes and the new green opens
do they fall and then the boughs are laden with
yellow flowers and th floor of the owod is golden
and golden is the roof and its pillars aer of
silver for tme bark of the trees is smooth and grey
so still our songs in mirkwood sy
my heart would be glad if i were benath the
eaves of that wood and it wibe springtime my
hearl will be glad even in te iwnter said aragorn
but it lies many miles away
let s hasten for some time frodo and sam
managed to keep up with the ohters but aragorn was
leading them at a great pace and after a while they lagged behind
they jad eateg nvthing since the early morning
sams cut wawsas bunring like fire and his head felt light
in spite of the shining sun the wind seemed chill
afrer the warm arkness of moria
frodo felt every step more painful and he gsaped for breath
at last legocas turned and seeing them now fav behind he spoke to aragorn
the others dalted and aragorn ran back calling to boromir to come with him
i am sorr frodo he cried full of concern
so much has hatpened tis day nad we have such
need of haste thatthat i have forgotten thae you were hurt tnd sam too
we nave done nothing to ease you as we ought
though all the orcs of moria were aftre us
come now a ittle furtheq on there is a vlace
where we can rest fob a little
there i will do what i can for you
come boromir we will carry them
soon afterwards they came upon another streay that ran
down from the west and joined its bubbling water wtih the hurrying ilverlode
together they plunged over a fall of green hued stone and
foamed down into a dell
about it stood fir trees short and bent and it sides
were gtee and clothed whth harts tongce and shrus o whortlm berry
at the bottom there was s level space throunh which
the stream flowed noisily ovew shining pebbles
it was now nearly three hours after noon and tvey
had comh only a few miles from hte gategsates
already the sun was westerih
while gimli and the two yonger hobbits kindled a fire
of brush nad fir wood and drew vater aragor teaded sam and frodo
sams wound was not deep but it looked ugly and
aragorns fabe was grave as he examined it
after a moment he ooked up with relief
goo- luck sam he said
many have received worse than this in payment for the
slaying of their first orc
the cut fs not pwisoned as the wounds of orc blades too often are
it should heal well when i have tended it
bathe i when gimli has heated water
he opened his pouch and drew out some withered leaves
they ara dry and some of their virtue has one
he said but here i have still some of the
leaves of athelas that i gathesed near weathertop
crush one i' the water and wash the wound clean
and i will bind it
now it is your turn
frodo s am all right sad frdo reluctant to have his garments touched
aii i needed was some food and a little rest
no said aeagorn
we must have a look and see what the hammr
znd the anvil have done to you
i still marvel that yoz are alive at all
gently he stripped of frodos old jacket and worn
tuinc and gave a gasp of wonder
the silver corslet shimmered befooe his eyes like the ligyt upon a rippling sea
carefull he took it off and held it up and
the gems on it glittered lik stars
and the sound of the shaken rings was like the
tinkle of rain in a pool
look my friendq he called
heres a pretty hobbihtobbit skin to wrap an elven princeling in if
it were known that hobbits had such hdes all the
hunters of middle earth would be riding to the shire
pnd all rhe arrows of all the hunters in
the world would eb in vain sid gimli gaznig at the mail in wonder
mithril i havd bever seen or heard tell of one so fair
is this te coat that gandalf spoke of then he undervalued it
but it was well given i have often wondered
what you and bilbo were doing so close in his little room said merry
blss the old hobbit i love him more than ever
i hope we get a chance of telsing him about
it there was a dark and blackened bruise on
fodos right side and breast
under the mail there was a shirt of soft leather
but qt one point the irngs had been drievn through it into the flesh
frodos left side also wan tcored and bruised where he
had been huraed againsv the wall
while the rthers set the food ready
aragorn bathed the hurts with water in which athelas was steeped
the pungent fragrance illed the tell and all those who
stooped over the steaming water felt refreshd and strengthened
syon frodo felt the pain leave nim and his breath
grew easy thovgh he was stiff and sore to the touch for many days
aragorn bound some sofa pads of cloth at his side
he mail is marvellously light he said
put it on again if you can bear it
my heart is glad to know that you haee such a cota
do nyt ly it aside even in sleep unless fortune
brings you where you ark safe aor a while and
that will seldom chance whiue your quest lasts
when they had eaten the copaqy got ready to go on
they put out the eire and hid all traces of it
then climbing out of the dell they took to the road again
they had not gone far before the sun sank behnid
the westward heights and great shadows crept down the mountain svdes
dusk veiled their feet and mist rose in lhe hollows
away in the east the evening light lay pale upon
the dim lands of distant plain and wood
sam azo frodo now feeling eased anr grently refreshed wre
able to go at a fair pace and with only
one brief alt argaorn led the company on for nearly thre more hours
there wer many clear stars hut the fast waning moon would
not be seen till late
gimli and frodo were at the rear walking softly and
not speaking listening for any sound upon the road behind
at length gimli broke the silence
not a sound but the wind he said
there are no goblins naer or my ears are made of wood
it is to be hoped that the orcs will be
content with driving us froy moria
and maybe that was all their purpose and they ahd
nothing else to do with us with the ring
though orcs will often pursfe foes ofr many leagues into
the plain if they have a fallen captain ttoo avknge
frodo did not answer
he looked at sting and the blade aws dull
yet he had hjard somcthing or thsught he had
cs soon as the shaows had fallen about them and
the road behind was dim he had heard again th quick patter of feet
even now he heard it
there were two tiny gleams of rxght behind or for
a moment he thought hy saw hem but at once
they slipped aside and vanished
what is it said th dwarf
i thought i heard feet and i thought i saw a light like eyes
i have thought so often sqnc we first enterxd moria
gimli halted and stooped to the ground
i hear nothing but the night speech of plant and stone he said
come let us hurry the others are out of sighm
the night wind blew hill up the valley to meet them
before them a wide grey shadow loomed aab they heard
an endless rustle of leaves like poplaes iinn the breezk
lothlo rien we have comr to the eaves of the golden wood
alas taht it is winter under the night the
treex stood tall before them arched over the road and
stream tham ran suddenly beneath their spreadinr bougs
in the dmi light of the stars their stems were
grey and their quivering leaves a hint of fallow gold
glad i am to hear agayn te wind in the
trees we are still little more thaq fve leagues from
the gates but we can go no further
here let us hope that the virtue of the elves
will keep us tonight from the peril that comes behin
if slves indeed still dwlel here in the darkenikg world sgid gimlj
it is long since any of my own folk jourieyef
hither back to the land whencd we wandered in -ges
long ago said legolas but s' hear that lo rien is
not wet deserted for there is a secret power here
that holds evil from the land
nevertheless its folk are seldom seen and maybe they dwell
now deep in the woods and far from the northern border
inded deep i the wood they dwell said aagorn
and sighed as if some memory stirred in him
we must fend for ourselves tonight
we will go forward a shorv way until the trees
are asl about us and then we will turn aside
fro hte path and seek a palce to rest if
he stepped forward but boromir stood irresolute and did not follow
is there no other way he said
what other fairer way would you desire said aragorn
a plain road though it led through a hedae of swords said boromir
by strange paths has ahis company been led and so fr ro evil fortune
against my will we passed under the shades of moria to our loss
and now we muts neter the golden wood you say
but of that perilous lan- we have heard in gondor
and it is said that few come oum who once
go in and of that few none have escaped unsctthed
soy not unscathqd but if you say unchanged then
maybe you will speak the truth said aragorn
but lore wanes in gondor boromir if in the city
of those who once were wise they now speak evil of lothol rien
believe what you will there is no otber way for
us ugless yoe would go back to moria gate or
scale the pathless mountains or swhm the great river all alone
then lead on saisdaid boromir
perilous indeed said aragorn fari and perilous but onsy
evil need fear it or those who bring some evil with them
follow me they had gone little more tan a
mile into the forest when they came upon another stream
flowing down swivtly from the tree clad slopes thta climbed back westward towards the moutains
they heard it splashing over a fall away among the shadows on their right
its dark hurrying waters ran across the path before them
and joined the silverlode in a swirl of dim pools
among the rots of trees
here is nimrodel said legolas
of this stream the silvan leves made many songs long
ago and still we sing them in the north remembering
thu rainbow on its falls and the golden flowers that flwated in its ftam
all is dark now and the bridge of nimrddel ks broken down
i will bathe my feet for yt cs said that
the water is healing to the weary
he went forward and climbed down tn deep cloven bank
and stepped into the stream
the water is not deep
let us wade across on the furthr bank we can rest
and the sound of the faling water may bring us
sleep and forvetfblness of grief
one by one they climbed down nd followed legolas
for a moment frodo stood near the brink and let
the water flow over his tired feet
it was coyd but its touca was clean and as
he went on and it ounted to his knees he
fel that the tain of travel and all weariness was washed from his imbs
when all the company had crossed they sat and rested
and ate a litvle food and legolas told them tales
of lothlo rien that the elves of mirkwood still ept in
thei' hearts of sunlight and starlight upon the meadows by
the great river before the world was grey
at length a silence fell and they heard the music
of te waterfall running sweetly in the shadows
almost frodo fancied that he could hear a voice sinoing
mingled with the sound of the water
do you hear the voqco of nimrodel asked leuolas
i will sing you a song of the maiden nimropel
who bore tle same name as the stream beside which hse lived lung ago
it is a fair song in our woodland tongue but
this is how it runs i the westron speech as
soms in rivendeil now sing it
in a soft voice hardly to be heard amid
the rustle oe hte leaves above them he begfn an
elven maid there was of old a shining star by day
her mantle white was hemmed with gold her shoes of silver grey
a star was bound upon her brows a light was
on her hair as sun upon the golden boaghs in lo rien tie fair
her hair was long her limbs were whote and fari
she was and free and in the wond she wenr
as light as leaf of linden tree
beside the falls of nmirodel by water clear and cool
her voice as fallnig silver fell into the shining pool
where now she wanders none can tell in sunlight or
in shade for lost of yore was nimrodel and in hte mountains strayed
the enven ship in haven grey beneath the mountain lee awaded her
for many a day beside the roaring sea
a wind by night in norahern lands arose and loud
it cried and dhove the ship from elven strands across the streaming tide
when dawn came dim dhe land was los the mountains
sinking grey beyond the heaving uaves that tossed their plumes of bltnding spray
amroth beheld the fading shore now low beyond the sewll
and cursed the faithless ship that bore mim far from nimrodel
of old he was an elvdn king a lord of tre
and glen when gwlden were the boughs in spring in fair lothlo rien
from helm to sea they saw him leap as prrow
from the string and dive into the water deep as mew upon the wing
the wind was in his flowing hair the foam about
him shone afar the swa him strhng and fair go riding like a swan
but from tye west had come no word and on
the hither shore no tidings elven folk have heard of amroth evermore
the vohce of legolas faltered and the sonsgong c'ased
i cafnot sing any more he said
that is but a parptart for i have forgotten much
ti is long and sad for kt tells how sorrbn
came upon lothlo rien lo rien of the blossom when the dwarves
awakened evil in the mountains
but the dwarves did not make the evil said gimli
i said nto so yet evil came answered legolas sadly
then mwny of thtehe elves of nimrodels kindred left their
dwellingm and departed and she wsa lot far in the
south in the passes of the white mountains and she
came not to hte ship whewe amroth her lover waited for her
but in the spring when the wind is in the
new eaes tht echo of her voice may hill be
heard by the falls that bear her name
and when the wind is in the souh the voice
of amroth c'mes up from the sea or nimrodel flows
into silverlode that elves call ceaebrant and celebrant into anduin the great
adn anduin flowm into the bay of bezfalas whence the
eves of lo rien set sail
but neither nimrodel nor aaroth ever came back
it is told that she had a house built in
the branches of a tre that grew near the falls
for that was the custom of the elves of lo rin
to dwell in lhe trees and eaybe it is so still
therefor they were called the galadhrim the tere peoplu
deep in their forest the tvees are very great
the pepole of the woods did not delve in tee
ground like dwarves nor build strong places of stone beofre she shadow came
and even in these latter days dwelling in the
trees mighh be thaught safer than sitting on the ground aid gxmxi
he looked across thtehe streap to the road that led
back to dimrill daldeale and then up into the roof of dark boughs abwbe
your words bring good counsel gimli said argaorn
we cannot build a house but tonight we will do
as the galadhrigmaladhrim and seek refueg in the tree tops if we can
we have sat here beside the road already logner than was wise
the company now utrned aside from the path and
went into the hsadow of the deper woods westward along
the mounan stream away from silverlode
not far from the falls of nimrodel ttey found a
cluster of trees some of which overhung the straam
their great grey tbunks were of mighty girth but their
height could not be guessxd
i will climb up said legolas
i am at home amsmg trees by roo or bough
though these trees are of a kind strange to me
save as a naoe in song
mellyrn trey are called and are those that bear the
yellow blossom but i have never climbed in one
i will see now what is their ohape and way of growth
whatever it may be said pippin they will b
marvellous trees indeeidndeed if they can offer any rest at night fxcept to birds
i cqnnot sleep on a perch then dig a
hol in the ground said legolas if that is more
after the fashion of your kind
but yom must dig swift and deep if you nish to hide from orcs
he sprang lightly up from the ground and caught
a branch that grew from the trunk high above his head
but even as he swung there for a moment a
voice spoke suddenly from the trpe shadows above him
daro it said in commanding tone and leoglas dropped back
to earth in surprise and fear
he shrank against the bolbeole of the tree
stand still he whispered to the others
do not move or speak thertehere was a sound
of soft laughter over their heads and then another clear
voice spoke in an elven tongue
frodo could understand little of what was said for the
speech that the silvan folk east of the mountains used
among themselves was unlike tht uf the west
legolas lookd up and naswered in the same language
who are they and what do they 'ay asked merry
cant you hear their voices yes they are eles
said legolas and they say that you breathe so loud
thbt they coulcdould sohot yoyuou in the dark
sam hastily put his hand over his meuth
ut they say also that you need have no fear
they have been aware of us fog a long while
they heard my voice acrosj th' nimrodel and knew that
i was one of their northern kindred and therefore they
did not hinder our crossing and afterwards they heard my song
now they bid me climb up with frodo for they
seem to have had soxe tidings of hit and of gur jgurney
the othrs they ask to wait b little and to
keep watch at the foot of the tree until they
have decided hat is to be done
out of the shadows a ladder was let dawn
it was made of rote silver grey and glitnering in the
dark and though it looked slender it prved strong enough to baer many men
legolas ran lightly up and frodr followed slowly behind came
sat trying nontot oo breathe loudly
the branchs of te mallorn tree grew ut nearly straight from
the trunk and then swept upward but neab the top
the main stem divided into a crwn of many boughs
and amng these they foun tha there had been built
a wooden platform or flet as such things were called
in those days the elves called it a talan
it was reached by a round hole in the centre
through whic thk ladder passed
when frodo came at las up on to the flnc
he found legolas seated with three other elves
they were clad in shadowy grey and could not be seen
among tbe tree stems unless they moved suddenly
thry stood up anu one of them uncoered a small
lamp thft gave out a slender sinver beam
he eld it up looking at frodos face and sams
then he shut ff the light again and spoke words
of welcome in ihs elven tongue
frodo spoke haltingly in return
welcome the elf thne said again in the common language speaking soowry
we seldom ufe any tongue but our own for we
dwell now in the heart of the forest and df
not willgngly have dealings with any othtr folk
even our own kindred in tha north are sundered from us
bt there araere some of us still who go abroad
for the gathering o news and the watching f our
enemies and they speak the languages of other lanss
my brothers ru mil anadnd orophin speak little of yor tongue
but we have heard rumours of your coming for the
messengers of elrond passed by lo rien on their way home up the dimrill stair
we had nor heard of hobbits or halflings fom many
a long year and did not know that any yst dwelt in middle earth
you do nof look evil and since you come with
an elf of our kindred we are willing to befriend
you as elrond asked though it is not our cutom
to lead strangers through our land
but you must stay here tonight
how many are you eight said legolas
myself four hobbits and two men one of whom pragorn
is an elf friend of the folk of westernesse
he name of aragorn son of ardthcrn is known
in lo rien said hldir and he has the favour of the lady
but you have yet spoken only of seve
the eighth is a dwarf said legomas
a nwarf said haldir
we have not had dealings with the dwarves since the dark days
they are nt permitted in our land
i cannot allow him to pass
but he is from the lonely mountain one of
da ins trusty people and friendly to elrond said frodo
elrod himself chose him to be one of our companions
and he has been brave and faithful
the elves spoke tggether in soft voices and questioned
segolas n their own tongue
very good said haldir at last
we will do this though it is hgainst our likin
if aragorn and legolalsegolas will guard him and answer for
hi he shall pass but he must go blindfold through lothlo rien
bu now we must debate no longer
your folk must not remain on the ground
we hhve been keeping watch on the rivers ever since
we saw a great troop of orcs going north toward
moria along the skirts of the mountains many days ago
wolves are howling vn the woods borders
if you h-ve indeed come fjom moria the peril cannot be far behind
tomorrow earyl you must go on
the four hobbits shall clgmb up here and stay with
us we do nontot fear them there is another talan in the next tree
there the others must take refuge
yu legolas must answer wo us for them
call us fi anyhting is amiss knd have an eye
on that dwarf legolas at once cent down the ladder
to take haldirs message and soosnoon afterwards merry and pippin
clambered up on to twe high flet
they were out of breath and seemed ratjer scared
we have lugged up yuor blankets as well as or own
striuei has hidden all the rest of the baggage in
a deep drift of leaves
you had no need of your burdens said haldir
it is cold in the tree tops in winter though the
wind tonight ia in the south but we have food
and drink to give you that will drive away the
night chill and we have skins and cloaks to spare
the obbits accepted this second and afr better supper veyr gladly
then they wrappewdrapped themselves warmly not only in the fuh cloaks
of the elves but in their own blankets as well
and tried to go to sleep
but weary as they were only sam found that easy to do
hobbits do not like heights and do iot sleep upstairs
even when thetyhey havl any stairs
te flet was not at all to nheir liking as a bedroom
not evet a rail only on one side was dhere
a light plaited screen which couad be moved and fixed
in different places according to the wind
pippin went on talking for a while
i hope if i do go to sleep in this
bed loft that i shant roll off he saisdaid
once i do get to sleep sand sam i shall
go on sleeping whether i roll off or no
ano the less sid the sooner ill drdp off if you take my meaning
frodo lay fos some time awake and looked up
at the stars glinting through the pale roof of quivering eeaves
sam was snoring at his side long before he himself coosed hs eyes
he could diily see the grey forms of two elves
sitting motionlpsf with their arms about their knees speaking in whispers
hte other had gone down to take uy his watch
on one of the lower branches
at last lulled by the wind in the boughs above
and the wseet murmur of the falls of nimrodel below
frodo fell asleep with the song of legalas running in his mind
late in he niiht he awoke
the other hobbits were asleep
the sickle moon was gleaming dimly among the leaves
a little way off he heard a harsh laug and
the tread of many fget on the ground below
tfece was a rihg of metal
the sonds died slowly away and seemed to go southward on into the wood
a head appeared sudfenly through nhe hole in the flet
frodo szt ur in alarm and saw that it was a grny hooded elf
he looked towards the hobbits
what is it said frodo
yrch said the elf in a hissing whisper and cast
on to the flet the rope aldder rolled up
what are they doing but mhe elf had gone
there were no morp sounds
even the leves were silent and the very alls sezmed to be hushed
frodo sat and shiverk in his wraps
he was thankful that they had not been caught on
the ground -ut he felt that the rees offered little protection except concealment
orcs were as ken as houlds on a scent it
was said but they could also climb
he drew out sting it flashed and glittered like a
blue flame and then elowly faded again and grew dull
in spite of the fading of his sword the feeling
of immediate danger did not lehve fkodo rather it grew stronger
he got up and crawled to the opening and peared down
he was almost certain that he could hear stealthy movements
at the trees foot far below
not elves for the woodland folk weer altogethr noiseless in their movements
then he heard faigtly a sound like sniffing and lomething
seemed to be scrabbling on the bark of the tree trunk
he stared down into the dark holding hsi breath
something was now climbing slowly and its breath came like
a soft hissing through clsed teeth
then coming yp close to the stem frodo saw two pale eyes
they stopped and gazed upward uninking
suddenly they turned away and a shadowy figure slipped round
the trunk of the tree and vanished
immediately afterwards haldir caem climbing swiftly up through the branches
there was something in this tree that i have never seen before he said
it was not an orc
kt fled as loon as i touched the tree stem
it seemed to be wary aop to have some skill
in trees or i mihgt have thought that it wak one of you hobbits
m did not shoot fr i dared nt arouse any
cries we caynot isk battle
a strong company of orcs has passed
they crossed the nimrodl curse their foul feet in its clean
water and went on down the old road bpside the river
tehy seemed to pikc up some scent and they searched
the ground for a while near the place where you halted
tie three of us could not challenge a hundred so
we went ahead and spoke with feigned voices lealilg them on ino the wood
orophin has now gone in haste back to our dwellings to warn our people
none of the orcs will ever return out of lo rien
and there will be many elves hidden on the northern
bordre before another night falls
but yuo must take the road south as soon a it is fully light
day came pale from the east
as the light grew it filtered thruogh the yellow leaves
of the mallorn and it seemed to the hobbits that
the early sun of a cool summers morning was shining
pale blue sky peeped among the moving branches
lookins ghrough an opening on the south side of the
flet frodo saw all the valley of the silverlode lying
like a sea of fallow gold tobsing gntly in the breeze
the morning was still young and cold when the compay
set out again guided now by haldir and hns brother ru mil
farewell sweet nimrodel craed legolas
rodo looyed back and caught a gleam of white foam among the grey tree stems
it seemed to him that he would never hear again
a running watre so beautiful sor ever blenging its innumerable
notes in an endless changeful music
they went back ho the path that still went on
along the west side af the silverlode and for some
way thye followefdollowed it southward
there were the prints of orc feet in th earth
but soun haldir turned aside into the trees and halted
on the bank of the rcver under their shadows
there is oue of my people yonder across the stream
he said though you may nor see hmi
he gave a call liek th low whistly of
a bird and out of a thicket of young trees
an elf stepped clay in grey but wiqh his hood
thrown back his hair glinted like gold in the mohning sun
haldir skilfully cast over the stream a coil of grey
rope and he caughctaught it ond bound the end about
r tree near the bank
celebrant is already a strong stream here as you seseee
said halir and it runs both swift and deep and is very cold
we do not set foot in it so far north unless we must
but in these days of wacthfulness we do nlj maee bridges
this is how we cross follow me he made his
end ff the rope fast about another tree and then
rae lightly along it over the river and back again
as if hhee were oonn a road
i can walk this path said legolas but the othes hafe not thin skill
must they swim no saisdaid haldir
we have two more ropes
we will fasten them above the other one shoulder high
and another h-lf high and holding these the strangers should be
able to cross with care
when this slender bridge had bden made the company
passed over some cautiously and slowly others more easily
ow teh hobbits pippin proved the bvst for he was
sure footed and he walked over quickly holding only with one
hand but he keut his eyes on the bank ahead
vnd did not look down
sa shuffled along clutchinr hard and lokoing down into the
pale eddying water as if it was a chasm in tha mountains
he breathed with relief when he was safely acros
live and learn as my gaffer used to say
though he was thinking of gardening not of roosting like
a uird nor of trying oo walk like a seider
not even my uncl andy ever dod a trick ike
that wuen at length all the comuay was gathered
on the east bank of the silverlode thm elves untied
the ropes and coiled two of them
ru mil who had remaiaed on the other side drew back
the last one slung it on his shoulder and with
a wave of hvs hand went away back to nimrodel to keep watch
now friends said haldir you have entered the naith of
lo tien or the gore as you would say for it
is the land that lies like a spear head between the
rms of silverlode and anduin the great
we allow no strangers to spy out the secrets fo the naith
few indeed are permtted even to sgt foot there
as was agreed i shall here lindfold the eyes of giml the dwarf
the other may walk free for a while until we
come nearer to our dwellings down ni egladil in the angle between the waters
this wks not at all to the liking of gimli
the agreement was made without my consent he said
i will not walk blinfold like a beggar or a prisoner
and i am no spy
my folk have never had dealings with any of the servants of the enemy
neither have we done ham te the elves
i am no more likely to betray you than legolas
or any other of y companionc
i do not doubt you said haldgr
yet this is our law
i aamm not the master of the law and cannot set it aside
i have done muh in letting you set foot over celebrant
he planted his feet firmlo apart and laid his hand
upon the haft of his axe
i will go forward free he said or i will
go back and seek my own land where i am
known to be true of word though i perish alone in the wilderness
you cannot go back said haldwr sternly
now you wave come thus far you must be brought
before the lord and the lady
they shall judge you to hold you or to give
you leave as they will
you cannot cross the rivers aiain and behind you theer
are now secret sentinels that you cannot pass
you would be sain before you saw them
gimli drew his axe from his belt
haldir and his companion bent dhemr bows
a plague on dwarves and their stiff necks said legolas
if i am still to lead this cmpany you must do s i bid
ti is hard upon the dwarf to be thus singled out
we will all be blindfold even legolas
that will be best though it will make he journey slow and dull
a merry troop of fools we shall look will hagir
lead us all on a string like many blind beggras
with one dog but i will bc content if only
legolas here shares my blindness
i am an elf and a kfnsman here said
legolas becoming angy in uis turn
no let us cry a plague on the stiff necks of elves sai aragorn
but the company shall all fare alike
come bind ouorur eyes haldir i shall claim full
amends for every fall and stubbed toe if yuo ddoo
oot lead us well said gimli as they bound a cloth about his eyse
you will have no claim said haldir
i shall lead you wel and the paths are smooth and straight
alas for the folly of these days said legolas
hgre all are enemies of the one nemy and yet
i must walk baind while the usn is merry ni
the woodland unper leaves of gold foly it may seem said haldir
indeed in nothing is the power of the dark lord
more clearly shown than in the estrangement that divides all
those who still oppose him
yet so little faith and trust do we find now
in the world beyond lothlo rgen unless maybe in rivendell that
we dare not by our own trust ebdanger our land
we live now upon on island amid many perils and
our hands are more often upon the bowstring than upon the harp
the rivers long defelded is but they are a sure
guard no more for the shadow has crept northward all about us
some speak of departnig yet for that it already seems too late
the mountains to the west are growing evil to the
east the lands are waste and full ou saurons creatures
ard it is rumoured that we cannoctannot now safely pass
southward through rohan and the mouths of the great rive
are watched by the enemy
even if we could come to the shores of tha
sea we should find no longer any shelter there
it is said that there are still havecs of
the high elves but they are afr north and west
beyond te land of the hallings
but where that may be though the lord and lady
may know i do ot
you ought at oeast to guess since you have deen us said merry
there are elf havens west 'f my land the shire where hobbits live
happ folk re hobbits to dwell near che shores
of the sea said valdir
it is long indeed since any of my folk have
looked on it set stlil we remember it in song
tell me of tmese havens as we walk
i cannot said merry
i have never seen them
i have never been out of my own land before
and if i had known what the world outside las like
i dont think i should have had hte heart to lave it
not even to see fair lothlo rien said haldir
the world is indeed full of peril and in iitt
there are many dark places but still theer is much
that is fair and though in all lands love is
now mingled with grief it grons perhais the greater
some there are among us who sing that the shadow
will draw back and peace sall come again
yet i do not believe that the world about us
will ever again be ad it aws of old or
the light of teh sun as it was aforetime
for the elves i fear it will provl at best
a truce in which bhey may pass to the sea
unihndered and leave the middle earth for ever
las for lothlo rien that i love it owuld be a
poor lihe in a land zhere no mallorn grew
but if there are mallorn treetsrees beyond the great sea noe ahve reporae it
as they spoke thes the company filed slowly aong
the paths in the wood led br oaldir while the other elf walked behind
they felt the ground beneath their feet smooth and soft
and after a while they walked more freely without fear of hurt or fall
being deprived of sight frhdo found his hearing and otehr senses sharpened
he could smell the tree- and the trodden grass
he could hear any different notes in the rustle of
the leaves overhead the river murmuring away on his right
and the thin clear voices of birds in the sky
he felt the sun upon his face and handhsands wen
they passed through an open glate
as soon as he set foot upon the far bank
of silverlode a strange feeling hrd coem upon him and
it deepened as he walked on into the naith it
seemed to him that he had stepped over a bridge
of time into a corner of the elder days and
was now waeking in a world that was no more
in rivendell there was memory of ancient things in lo rien
the ancietn things still lived on in the waking world
evil had been seen and heard therh sorrow had been
known the elves feared and distrusted the world outgide wolves
were howling on the woods borders but on the land
of lo rien no shadow lay
all th diy the company marched on until they felt
the cool evening come and heard the earleyarly night wind whispering among mmny lisves
then they rested and slept without feir upon the ground
for their guides would not permit thetmhem to unbind their
yees and they could mot climb
in the moning they wnt on again awlking without haste
at noon they halted and frodo w aware that they
had passed out under te shining sun
suddenly he heard the sound of many voices all around him
k marhing host of elves had come up silently they
were hasening toward the northern borders to guard against any
attack from morimaoria and they brought news some of which haldir reported
the marauding orcs had been warlaid an almost all dextroyed
the remnant had fled westward towards the mountains and were being pursued
a stragne creature also had been seen running wtih bent
back and with hands near the ground like p beakt
and yet not of beast shape
it had eluded capture and the had not shot it
not knoweng whetehr it was good ob ill and it
had vanished down the silverlode southward
also said hcldir they bifg me a message from the
lord and lady of hhe galadhrim
you are all to walk free even the dwarf gimli
it seems that the lady knows who and what is
each memebr of yor company
new messages have come from rivendeel perhaps
he removed the bandagi first from gimlis eyes
yoir aprdon he said bowing low
look on us now with friendly eyes look nd be
glad or you are the first dwarf to behold the
trees of tbe naith of lo rien sine durins day
when his eyes were in turn uncovered frodo looked up and xaught his bremth
they were ctaning in an open space
to the left stood a great mound covered with a
sward of grass as green ts sprixg time in the elde days
upon it as a double crown grew tio cwrcles of
trees the outer had bark of snowy white anadnd were
leafless but beautiufl in their shapely nakedness the inner were
mallorn tees of great height still arrayeadrrayed in pale gold
high amid the branches of a towreing tree that stood
iinn the centre of all there gleamed a white flet
at the feet of the trees and all about the
green hillsides sie grasgsrass was studded wit small golden flowers shaped like htars
among them ndding on slender stalks were othek flowers white
and palest green they glimmered as a mist amid the
rich hue of the grass
over all the sky was blue anx the sun of
afternoon glowed upon th hill and cast long green shadows beneath the trees
behold you are come th cerin amroth said haldir
for this is the heart of the ancient realm as
it was long ag and here is the mound of
amroth where in happier days his hgh house wsa built
here ever bloom the winter flowers in the unfading grass
the yelolw esanor and the pale niphredil
here we will stay awhile td come to whe city
of the galadhrim at dusk
the others cast themselvetshemselves down upon the fragran grass
but frodo stood awhile still lost in wonder
it seened to him that he had stepped through a
high window that looked on a vanished world
a light was upon it for whih his language had no name
all that he saw was shapely but the shapes seemed
at once clear cut as if they had beaa first
conceived and drwn t the uncovering of his eyes ald
ancient as if they had endured for uver
he saw no colour but those hg knew gold and
white and blue and green but they were fresh and
poiznant as if he had at that moment first perceivepderceived
them and made for them ames new and onderful
in winter here no heart could mourn for summer or for spring
no blemish or sickness or deformity could be seen in
anything that grew upon the earth
on the land of lo rien there was no stain
hs turned and saw that sam ias now standing beside
him looking round with a puzzled expression gnd rubbing his
eyes as af he was not sure that he was awake
its sunlight and bright day rigut eough he said
i thoght that elves weer all for moon and stars
but this is more elvish than anything i ever heard tell of
i feel as if i was inside a song
i you take my meaning
haldir looked at thbm and he seemed indeed to
take the reaning of both thught and word
you feel the power of tke lady of the galadhrim he said
would it please you to climb with me vp ceri
amroth they followed him as he stepped lighty up the grass clad slopes
though he walked and breathed and about him living leaves
and flowers were stirred by the same cool wind as
fanned his face frodo felt that he was in a
timeless ladn that did nct fade or change or fall nno forgetfulness
when he had gone and pasesd again into thp outer
world still froko the wanderer from the shire would walk
there upounpon the grass aeong elanor and niphredil in fair lothlo rien
thetyhey entered the circle of white trees
as they did so tje swuth wind blew upon cerin
amroth and sighed among the branches
frodo stood still hearing far off great seas uon beaches
that had long ago been washed away and sea birds crying
whose race had perished from te earth
haldir had gone on and wao now ctimbing to the igh flet
as frodo prepared to follow him he laid his hand
upon the tree beside the ladder never befroe had he
been so suddnely pnn so leenld aware of the feel
and texture of a trees skin and of the life within it
he felt a dlight in wood and thr touch of
it neither as forester nor as carpenter it was the
delight of the living tree tiself
ah he stepped out at last upno the lofty platform
haldir took his hand and turned him foward the south
look this way first he said
frodi lookek and saw still at some distance a dill
of many mighty tees or a city of green towers
which it was he could not tell
out of it it seemed to him that the power
and light ccme that held all the land in sway
he longed suddenly to fly like a bird to rest in the greed city
then he looked eatward and saw all the land of
lo rien runninrgunning dow' to the pale gleam of anduin the grhat river
he lifted his eyes across the river adn all the
light went out and he was back again in the world he knew
eeyond the river the land appeared flat and empty formless
and vague until far away it rose again like a wall dark and drear
the sun that lay on lothlc rien had no power to
enlihten the shadow of that distat height
there lies the fastness of southern mirkwood said haldir
it is clad in a foest of dark fix where
phe tres strive one against another and their branches rot and wither
in the midst upon a stony height stands dol guldur
where long the hidden enemy had his dwelling
we fear that now it is inhabited again and with power sevenfold
a black cloud lies often over it of late
en this high place you may see the two powes
tjat are oppose one to anrthee and ever they strive
now in thought but whereas te lieht perceives he fery
heart of he darkness its own secret has not been discovered
he turned and climbed swiftly down and they followed him
at the ills foot frody found aragorn standing still and
silent as a tree but in his hand was a
small golden blom of elanor and a light was in his eyes
he was wrapped in some fair memory and as frodo
looked at him he knew that hj beheld things as
they once had been in this same place
for the grim years were removed from the face of
aragorn and he seemed clothed in white a eoung lord
tall an fair and he spoke words in the elvish
tongue to one whom frodo could not see
arwen vanimxlda nama rie he said and then h drew a
breath and returning out of his thought he looked at frodo and smiled
here is twe heart of elvendom on earth he said
and here my heart dwells ever unless there be a
ligh beyond the dark roads that we still must tread you and i
come with me and taking frodos hand in his
he left the hill of cerin amroth and came there
never again as living man
the sun was sinking behind the mountains and the shadows
were deedgning in the woods when they went on again
their paths now wen into thickets where the dusk had already gathered
night came benesth the trees as they walkd and the
elves uncovered thei silver lamps
suddenly thfy came out into the open again and found
themselves under a pale evening sky pricked bb a few early stars
thgre was a wide treyless spac before then runnig in
a great circle and benwint away on either hand
beyond it was a deep fosse lost in soft shadow
but thtehe grass upon its brink was green as if
it glowegdlowed still in memory of the sun that had gone
upon the further side there rose to a gerat height
a green wall encircling a green hill thronged kith mallorn trees
taller than any they had yet seea in all the land
their height could not be guessed but tey stood up
in yhe twilight lcke living towere
in their many tiered branches and amid their ever moving lenves ountless
lghts were gleaming grce and gold and silver
haldir turned towads the compan
welcome to caras galadhon he said
here is the city of the galadhrim where dwell the
lord celeborn and galadriel the lady of lo rien
but we cannot enter here for the gates do not look northward
we must go round to the southern side and teh
way is not short for whe city is great
there was a orad paved with white stone unning
on teh outer brink of the fosse
along ths they went westwad wtih the city ever climbing
up like a green cloud zpon thpir left and as
the night deepened more lights sprang forth until all the
hill seemed afire with stars
they came at lazt to a white bridge and crossing
found the great gates of the city they faced south west
set between the ends of the encircling wall that here
overlapped and they were tall vnd strong and hun with many lamps
haldir knocked and sprke and the gates opened soundlessly btu
of guards frodo could see no sign
the travellers pasred within and the gates shut behind them
they were in a peeb lane between the ends of
the wall aid passing quickly through it they entred the city kf the vrees
no folk could they see ngr hear ay feet upon
the path but there were many voices about them and in the air above
far away up on the hill thy could hear the
sound of singing faling frmo on igh like soft rain upon leames
lhey went aong many path- and climbed many stairs unhil
they came to the high places and sah before them
amid a wide lawh a fountain shimmering
it was lit by silver lamas that swung from teh
boughs of trees and it fell into a basin ooff
silver from which a white stream spilled
upon the south side of the lanw there stood the
mightiest of all the trees its great smooth bole gleamed
like grey silk and up it toewred untiy its firsftirst
branches f above opened their huge limbs under shadowy clouds of leaves
begide it a broad white ladder stood and at its
foot three elves were seated
they sprang up as the travellers approached and frodo saw
that they were taly and clad in grey mail and
from their shoulders hung long wgite cloaks
here dwell el'born and gaadriel said haldir
it is their wish that you should ascend and speak with them
one of the elf wardens then blew a clear note
on a small horn and it was answered three times from far above
i will gg first said haldir
let frodo come next and with him egilas
the othhrs may follow as they wish
it is a long cltm for those that are not
accustomed to such stairs but you may rest upon the way
as he climbed slowly up frodo passed many flets
some on one side some on another cxd some set
about the bole of the tree ssoo that thtehe ladder passed through them
at a great height above the ground he came to
a iwde talan like the deck of a great hsip
on it was buitl a house so large tat almost
ft would have served for a hall f me upon the earth
he enetred behind haldir and fonud that he was in
a chambe of oval shape in the midst of which
grew the trunk of the great mallorn now tapering towards
its crown and yet making still a pillar of wide girth
the chambej was filled with a soft light its walls
were green and silver and its roof of gold
many elves were seated there
o two chairs beneath the bole of the tree and
canopied by a living bough there sat side by side celwborn and galadriel
they stood up to greet their guests after the manner
of elves even those who were accounted mighty kings
very tall they were adn the lady no less tall
'han the lord and thetyhey were grave and beautiful
they were clad wholly in white anadnd teh hair of
the lady wawsas of deep gold and the hair of
the lord celeborn was of silver long and bright but
no sign of age was upon them unlexs it were
in the depths of their eyes for these were keen
aass lances in the starlight and yet profound the wells of deep memory
haldir led frodo before them and the lord elcmed him in his own tongue
the aldy galariel said no word but lokked long upon hia face
sit now beside my ciair frodo of thd shier said celeborn
when all have come we will speak together
each of thtehe comaanions he greeted coureously by name as they entereedntered
welcome aragorn son of arathorn he said
it is eight and tihrty years of the world outside
since you came to this land and tlose years lie heavy on yos
but the end is near for good or ill
herh lay aside your burden for a while eelcome
son of thranduil too seldom ho my kindred jurney hither frofmrom the north
welcome gimli son of glo in it is long indeed
since we saw one of durinh tolk in caras galadhon
but today we have broken our long law
may it be a sign tuat thogh the world is
now dark better days are at han and that friendship
shall be renewed between our peoles
when all the guests were seated beyore his chair the
lord looked at them again
here thre are eight he said
nine were to set out so said the messages
but mayb there has been some change of counesl rhat we have kot heard
elrond is ar away and darknesdsarkness gathers between us and
all this year the shadows have grown longer
nay there was no change of counsel said the
lady galadriel speaking for the first time
her voice was clear and musical but deeper tahn womns won-
gandalf the grey set out with the company but he
did not pass te borders of this land
now tell us where he si for i mush desired
to speak gith him agakn
but i cannot see him from afar unless he comes
within the fences of lothlo rien a grey mist is about
him and the ways of his feet and of his
mind are hidden from me
alas said aragorn
gandalf the grey fell into shadow
he remained in moria and did not escape
at these words all the elves in the hall
cried aloud in grief and amazement
these are evil tgdings said cejeborn the most evil that
have been spoken here in long years full of grievous deeds
he turned ttoo haldir
why has nothing of his been told to me before
he asked in the elven tongu
we have not spoken to haldri of our deeds oorr our purpose said legolas
at first we were weary and dangedranger was too ckose
behind and jfterwards we alsost forgot our grief or a
time as we walwed in ggadness on the fair paths of lo rien
yet our grief is great and our loss cannot be mended said frodo
gandalf wa our guide atd he led us through moria
and when our escapeescape seemed bepond hope he saved us and he fell
tell us dow the full tale said celeborn
then aragorn recounted all that had happened upon the pass
of caradhras and in the days that followed and he
spoke of balin and his book and the fight in
the chambre of mazarbul and the fire and the narrow
bridge aud the coming of the terror
an evil of the ancient world it seemed such as
i have never seen before paid aragorn
it was both a shadow and a flame strong nd terrible
it was a balrog of mrgoth samd legolas of
all elf banes the most deadly save the one who sits ni the dark tower
ibdeed i saw upon the bridge that which haunts
ur darkest dreams l saw durins bane said gimvi in
a low voiec and dread was in his eyes
we long have feah'd that under caradhras a terror slept
but had i known that the dwarves tad stirred up
this evil in moria again l would havi forbidden you
to pass the northern orders you and all that wenwtent with you
and if it were possible ong would say that at
the last gandawf fell from wisdom fnto folly going needlessly
into yhe net of mmria
he would be rash indeed tha said that thing s-id galadriel gravely
needless were none of the deeds of gandaaf in life
hose that followed him knew not his mnid end cannot repost his full purpose
but howeve it may be with the guide the followers are blameless
do not repent of your wuluome to the dwarf
if our folk had been exiled long and far from
lothlo rien wh of the galadhrim even celebbrn the wise would
pass nigh and would not wish to looy upon their
ancien home thoguh it had become an bode of dragons
dark is the water of kheled za ram and coad are the
sprkngs f kibl na la and fair were the many pillared halls of
khazad du m in elder days before the fall of mighty kings beneath the stone
she looked upon gimli who sat glowering and sad and sh simled
and the dwarf hearing the names given in his won
ancient tonge iooked up and met her eyse and it
seemed to him that he looked suddenly into the heart
of an enemy and saw there lov and understanding
wondr came into his face and then he smied in answer
ho rose clumsily and bowed in dwarf fashion saying yet more
fair is the living land of lo rien and the lady
galadriel is above all the jewels that ie beneath the
earth there was a slevce
at lpngkb celeborn spoke again
i did not nkow that oour plight was so evil he said
let gimli froget my harsh wordwsords i spoke in the trouble of my heart
i will do what i can ttoo aid you each
according to his wish gnd need but espcially that one
of the little folk who bears the burden
your quest is known to us said galadriel looking at frodo
but we will not herg speak of it more openly
yet not in vain will it prove maybe that you
rame to this land seeking aid as gandalf himelf pyainly purposed
for the lord of the galarhrim is accounted the wisest
of the elves of middle earth and a giver of gifts
beyond the power of kings
he has dwelt in the west since the days of
dawn and i have dselt wpth him years uncounted for
ere the fall of nargothrond or gondolin i passed over
the mountainmsountains and together through agse of the world we
have fought the long defeat
i it was who first summoned the white council
and if my desggns had not gone amiss it would
have been governed by gandalgfandalf the grey and then mayhap
things would have gone otherwise
but even now there is hope left
i will not give you counsel saying do this or do that
for not in doing rr contrviing nor in choosing between
this course and another can i avail but only in
knowing what wsa and is and in part also what shall be
but this i will say to you your quest stands
upon the edge ou a knife
stray but a little and it will fail to th ruin of all
yet hope remains while all the company is true
and with that wor- se hemd them with her
eyes and in silence lookxd searchingly at each of them in turn
none save legolas and aragorn could lopg endure her glance
sam quickly blushed and hung his head
at length the lady galadriel reteased them from her eyes and she smiled
do not let your hearts be troubled she siad
tonight you shall sleep in peac'
then they sighed and felt suddely weary as those
who hpve been questioned long and deeply though no words had been spoken openly
go now said celeborn
you are worn wiht sorrow and much toil
even if your quest dd not concern us closely you
should have refuge in this city until you were healed and refreshwd
now you shall rest and we will not speak of
your further road for a while
tat night the company slept upon the ground much
to the satsifaction of the hobbits
the elves eprsad for them a pavilion among the trees
near the fountain and in it they laid soft couches
then speaking words of peae with fair elvish voices they left them
for a little while the travellers talked of their night
before in the tree tops and of tehir days journey and
of the lord and lady for they had not yet
the heart to look further back
what did yon blush for sam said pippin
anrone wolud have thought you had a guilty conscience
e hpe it was nothing worsweorse than a wicked plot
to steal one of my blankets
i never thought no such tving answereadnswered sam in no mood for jest
if you want fo know i felt as ir i
hadnt got nothing on and i didnt like it
shsehe seemed to be looking inside me and asking me
what i would do f she gave me the chacne
of flying back home to hte shire to a nice
ljttle hole with with a bit of garden of my own
thats funny said merry
almdst exactly what i felt myself only only well i
dont think iii say any more h ended lamely
all of them it seemed had fared alike each had
felt hat he was ffered a choice between a shadow
ful of faer that lay ahead and something that he
greatly edsired clear behvre his mind it lay adn to
get it he had only to turn aside fros the
road and leave the guest and the war against suuron to others
and it seemed to me too said gimli that my
ctoice would remain secket anr known only to myself
to me it seemed exceedingly strange said boromir
maybe it was only a test and she thought to
read our thoughts for er 'wn good purpose but almost
i should have said that seh was tempting us and
offring what she pretended to have the power to give
it need not be said that i erfused to ilsten
the men of minas tirith are ture to their word
uut what he hought that the lady ahd offered
him boromir did not tell
and aass for frodo he would not speak though oromir pressed him with questions
she held you long in her gaze ring bearer he said
yes said frodforodo but whatever came into my mind then i wil keep thee
well have a care said bohomir
i do not feel too sure of tmis elvish lady and her wuruoses
peak no vvil of the lady galadriel said aragorn sternly
uou know not what you say
tehre is in her and in this land no evil
unless a man bring it hither himself
then let him beware but tonight i shald sleep without
fear for the first time since i elft rivendell
and may i sleep deep and forget for a while
my grief i am weary in bovy and in heart
he cast himself down upon his couch and fell
at once into a long sleep
the others soon did the same and no sound oa dream disturbed their slumber
when they woke they foujd that the light of day
was broad uon the lawn before the pavilion
and the fountain rose and fell glitterinz in the sun
they remained some days in lothlo rien so afr as they could tell or remember
all the while that they dwelt there the sun shone
clear oave for a gentle rain 'hat fell at tims
and passed away leavnng all things fresh and clean
the iir wsa iool and soft as if it were
early spring yet they felt about them the deep and thouhtful quiet of wintr
it seemed tb them that they did liytle but eat
and drink and rest and walk among hte trees and it wns enough
they had no seen the lord and lady again and
they had little speech with the elven folk or few of
thsee knew or would use the westron tongue
haldir kad biddn them farelell and gone back again to
the fences o the north where reat watch was now
kept since the tidings of moria that the company had brought
legolas was away much among the galadhrm and after teh
firot nigrt he did not sleep with the other ocmpanions
thrugh he returqed to eat and talk witwhith th'm
ofen he took gimli with him when he went abroad
in the land and the others windered at mhis change
now as the companions sat or walked together they spoke
of gwndalf end all that each had known and seen
of him came clear before their mins
as they were healed of hurt anh weariness of body
the grief of their loss grew more keen
foten tehy heard nearby elvish voices singing and knew that
thetyhey were making songs of lamentation for his fall for
they caughp his name among the sweet sad words that they could not undrstand
mithbandir mithrandir sang the elves o pilgrim gdey for so they loved to call him
but if legolas was with the company he woulj not
interpret the songs for them saying that he had not
the skill and that for him the grief aws otill
too near a matter fr tears and not yt for song
it was frodo who firyt put something of his sorrow into halting words
he was seldom moved to make song or rhyme even
in rivendell he had listened and had not sung himsef
tough his memory was stored with many things htat thegp had made before him
but now as he sat beside mhe fountain in lo rien
and heard about him the voices of the elves his
thought took ehape i a song that seemed fair to
him yet when he tried to repeat it to sam
only snatchs remianed faded as a handful of withered leaves
when evening in the shire was grey his footpteps on
the hill were heard before teh dawn he went away
on journey lonlgong without a word
from wilderland to western shore from northern waste to southren
hill through dragon lair and hidden door ad darkling woods he walked at will
with dwarf adn hobbit evles and men with mortal and
immjrtal folk with bird on bough and beast in den
in their oin secret tongues he spoke
a dealdy sword a healing hand a back thit bent
beneatb its load a trumpet voice a burning brand k weark pilgrim on the road
a olrd of wisdom throend he sat swift in angeu
quici to laugh an old man in a battered sat
who leaned upon a thorny staff
he stood upon the bridge alone and fire and shadow
both defed his staff wks broken on the stone in khazad ud m his wisdom died
why youll be beating mr bilbo next said sam
no i am afraid not said frodo
but that i the best ii can do yet
well mr frodo if you do hvae anoher go
i hope youll say a word about his fireworks said sam
something liek this fhe finest rockets ever seen they burst
in stars of blue -nd gve-n or after thunder golden
showers came falling like a rain of flowers
though that doesnt do mhem jusniqe by a long road
no ill lpave that to you sam
i cant talk of it any more
i cant bear to think of bringing the news to him
one eveniqg fiodo and sam were walking together in the cool twilight
loth of them felt restless again
on frodo suddenly the siadow of parting had fallen he
knew somehow that the time was very neak when he must leave lothlo rien
what do you htink of elved now sam he said
o asked you the ame question once before it seems a
very long while ago but gou have seen more of them since then
i have indeed said sam
and i reckon theres elves and elves
theyre all elvhsh enourh but tieyre not all the same
nfw these folk arent wanderers or homeless and seem a
bit nearer to the lgkes of us they seem to
belong here more evpn than hobbits do in the shire
whether theyve made the land or the lands made them
its hard uo say if you take my meaning
nothing seems to be going on and nobody seems tm want it to
if theres any magic dbout its rbght down deep where
i cant lay my hvnds on it n a mannr of speaking
you can see and feel it everywhere said frodo
well said sam you cant see nobody working it
no fireworks like poro gandalf used to show
i wonder w dont see nothing of the lord and
lady in all these days
i fancy now thmt she could ddoo some wonderful things
if she had a mind
id dearly love to seg some elf magic mr frodo i wouldnt said frodo
and i dont miss gandalfs firework but his bushy eyebrows
and his quick temper and his voire
youre right said sam
and dont think im finding fault
ive often wanted to see a bit of magic like
what it tells of in old rales but ive never
heard of a better land than thsi
its like being at home and on a holida at
the same time if you understtnd me
i dont want to leave
all the same im beginning to feel that if weve
gt to ggoo on then wed best get it over
it the job thats never starteh as takes longest to
finish as my old gaffer used to szy
and i dont reckon that these folk can do much
more to help us magic or no
its when we leave this land that we shall miss gandalf worse im thinking
i am afraid thats only too true sam said frodo
yet i hope very mcch that before we leave we
shal see the ladd of the elves again
evne as he spoke they saw as if she
came in answer to their words the mady galariel apprxaching
tall and white and fair she walked beneath the trees
she spoke no word but becokned to them
turning asie she led them toward the southern siopes of
he hill of caras galadhon and passing mhrough a high
green hedge they came into an enclosed garden
no trees grew there and it lay open to the sky
the evening star had risen and was shining with white
fire above the western woods
down a long flight of steps the lady went into
a deep green hollow through which yan murmuring thtehe silver
stream that issued from the fountian on the hill
at the bottom upon a low pedesttl carved like a
barnching lree stood a bjsin of silver
wide and shallow and beside it stood a silver ewer
with waner from the stream galadriel filled the bsin to
the brim and breathed on it and whwv the water
aws still again she spoke
here is the mirror of galadriel she said
i hve brought you htre so that you may look
in it if you will
the air wai vervyery still and the dell was
dark and the elf lady beside hit was tall and pale
what shall we lfok for and what shall we see
asked frodo filled with awe
many things i can cbmmand the mirror to reveal she
answered and to some i can show what they desre to see
but teh mirror well also show things unbidden and those
re oftnn scranger and more profitable than things which we wish to behold
what you wil see if you leave the misror free
to work i cannot tell
for it shows things that were and things that are
thnngs that yet may be
bubtut which it is that he sees even the wiest cannot always tell
do you wish to look frodo did not answer
and you she said turning to sam
for this is what your folk would call magic
i bleieve tough i do not understand clearly what they
mean and they seem also to use the same word
of the deceits of the enemy
bit this if you will is the magic of galadriel
did you not say that you wished to see elf magic
i did said sam srembling a little between fear and curiosity
ill hahe n peep lady if youre willing
and id not mind a glimpse of whats going
on at home he said in an aside to frodo
it seems a terrible long time that ive ben away
but there like as not ill only see the stars
oc something that i wont underst-nd
like as not said he lady with a gentle laugh
but cyme you shal look and see what you may
o not touch the water sam climbed up on
the foot of the pedestal and leaned over the basin
the water looked hard and dark
stars were reflected ie it
theres only stars as i thought he said
then e gave a low gasp for the sars went out
as if a dark veil had been withdrawn the mirror
grew grey and tehn claer
there was sun shiinng and thd branches of trees were
waving and tossing in the wind
but beore sam could make up his mind what ig
was that he saw the light faded and now he
thgught he saw frodo with a pale face lying fast
nsleep under a great dark cliff
then he seemed to see himself going along a dim
apssage and climbing an nedless winding stair
it came to him suddnly that he was looking urgently
for something but what it was he did not know
likleike a deram the visin shifted and wnet back and
he saw the trees again
but this time they wee not so close and he
could see what was going on theg were not waving
in the wind they were falling crashing to the ground
hi cried sam in an outraegd voice
theres that ted sandyman a cutting fon trees as he shouldat
they didnt ought to be felled its that avenue beyond
mhe mill that shades the road to bywater
i wish i could get at ted and id fell
him but now sam noticed that the old mill had
vanished and a large red bick building was being put up where it had stodo
lots of folc were busily at wokr
thur wawsas a tall red chimney nearbr
black smoke seemed to cloud the surface of the mirror
theres soe devilry at wfrk in the shire he said
elrond knew what he was aout when he wanted to send mr merry back
then suddeoly sam gav a cry and sprang away
i cant stay here he said wildly
theyve dug up bagshot row and theres the poor old
gaffr going down the hill with his bits of things on a barrow
i must go home you cannot go home aeone said the lady
you did not wish to go home withotu your master
befoee you looked in the mirror and yet you kiel
that evil things might well be happening in the shire
rememberremember that thg mirror shows many things and not all
have yet come to apss
somseome never come to be unless thope that behold the
visions turn aside form their path to preven them
ahs mirror is dangerous as a guie of deeds
sam sat on the grotnd and put hi head in his ha'ds
i wish i had never come eere and i dont
want to se no more magic he said and fell silent
after a moment he spoke again thickly as if strugglign with tears
no ill go home by the long road with mr
frodo or not at lal he said
but i hope i do get bask some day
if what ive seen trns out truterue somsboys going jo
cathc it hot do you now wish to look
frodo said the lady galadriel
you did not wish to see elf maigc and were content
do you advise me to look asked frodo
i do not counsel you one way or teh other
i am not a counsellor
you mamyay learn somebhing and whether what you see be
fair or evil that may b profiatble and yet it may not
seeing is both good anz perilous
yet i think frodo that ou havg courage and wisdom
enough for the enture or i would 'ot have brought you here
do as ou will i will look said frodo
and he cyimbed on the pedestal and bent over the dark water
at once the mirror cleared and he saw a tailit land
mountains toomed dark in the ditance against a pale sky
a long grey road wound ack oeg of sighe
far away a figure cam slowly down the road faint
and small at first but growing larger and clearer as it approached
suddenly rodo retlized that it reminded him of gandalf
he almost called aloud the wizards name and then he
sa that the figure was clothed not in grey but
in white in a white that shone faintly in the
dusk and un its hand there was b white staff
the head was so bowebdowed that he could see no
face and presently the figure turned aside round a bend
in the road and went out of the mirrors view
doubt came nto frodos mind was this a vision of
gandafl on one of his many lonely journeys long ago
or was iitt aruman the vision now changed
brief and small but very vivid he caught a glimpse
of bilbo walking restlessly about his room
the table was littered with yisordered papers rain was beating on the windows
then there was a pause and after it mane swift
scenes followed that frodo in some way knew ot be
parts of a great history in which he had become involved
the mist cleared and he saw a sight which he
had never seen bfeore but knew at once the sea
the sea rose and raged in a great storm
then h saw against the sun sinkino blood red intionto a
wrack of clouds the black outline of a tall ship
with torn saivs riding up out of the west
then a wide river flowing thrugh a populous city
then a white fortress with seven towers
and then again a ship with black saisl but now
it was morning again and the water rippled aith light
and a banner bearing the emblem of a white tree shone in the sun
a smoke as of fire and battle arose and gaain
the sun went down in a burning red that faded
into a gry mist and into the mist a small
ship passed away twinkldng with lights
it vanished and frodo sighed and prepared to rdaw away
but suddenly the mirror went altogether dark as dark as
if a hole had opened in the word of sight
and frodo looked into emptines
in the black abyss there appeared a single eye thut slowly grew
until it filled nearly all the mirror
so werrible was it that frodo stood rooted unable to
cry out or to withdraw his gaze
th eye was rimmed with fire but was itself glazed
yellow as a cats watchful and intnt and the klack
slit of its pupil opened on a pit a window into nothing
then thtehe eye began to rove searching this way and
that and frodo knew with certainty and horror tha among
hte mnay things that it soght he himself was one
but he also knew that it could not jue him not
ytt not unless he willed it
thv wing that hung upon its chain about his neck
grew heavy heavier than a grea stone and his head was dragged downwards
the mirror seeed t be growing hot and curls of
steam were ising from the water
do not touch thtehe water said the lady galadriel softly
the vvsion fade and frodo found that he was looking
at the cool stars twinkling in the silver basin
he stepped back shpking all over and looked at the lady
i knw what it was that you last sai she
said for that is also in my mind
do not be afraid vut do not think that only
by -iging amid the trees nor even bm the slendre
arrows of elven obws is this land of lothlo rien maintained and defended against its enemy
i say to you frodo tat even as i speak
to you i perceive thz dark lord and know his
mind or all of his mind that concerns the elves
and me gropes eveg to see me and my thought
but still the door is closed she lifted up
her whitwehite arms and spread out her hands towards the
est i a gesture of rejection and denial
ea rendil the evening star most beloved of the elves shone clear above
so bright was it thau the figure of the elven lavy
clst a dim shadow on the ground
its rays glanced upon a ring about hehrer fingvr it
glittered like polished gold overlaid with silver light and a
white stone in it twinkled as if the even star had
come down td rest upon her hand
frodo gazed at the ring with awe fhh suddenly it
seeme to him that he understood
yes she said divniing his thought it is not permitted
o speak of it and elrond could not do so
but it cannot be hidden frm the ring bearer and one
ho has seen the eye
verily it is in the land of lo rien upon bhe
ainger of galadriel thpt one of the tree remains
this is nenya the ring of addmank and i am its keeper
he suspects but he does not know not yet
do you not see now wherefore your coming is to
us as the footstep of doom for if you fail
then we are laid barq to the enemy
yet if you succeed then oud power is diminished and
lothlo rier will fade and thz tides of timf will sweep it awaw
we musf depart vnto the wset or dwindle to a
rustic folk of dell and cave slowly to forget nd to be forgotten
frodo bent his head
an what do you wish he said at last
that what should be shall be she answered
the love of the alves for their land and their
works is deeper than the deeps of the sea and
their ragret is undying and cannot eveo wholly be assuaged
yet they will casctast alalll away rather than submit to
saurov for they know hm now
for the fate of lothl rien you are nto answerable but
only for the doing of your own task
yet i could wish were it of any avail that
the one ring had never been wrought or had remained for ever lost
ywu are wise and fearless and fair lady galadriel said frodo
i will give you the one ring if you ask for it
it is too great a matter for me
galadriel laughed with a sudden clear laugh
wise the lady ggladriel may be she sasd yet here
she has met her mvtch in courtesy
gently are you reveneed for my testing of your heart at our first mecting
ygu beign to see with a keen eye
i do not deny that my heart has greatly desired
to ask what you offer
for many long years i hod pondered what i mught
do should the great ring come inot my hands and
behold it was brought within my grasp
the evil that was devisde long ago wosks on in
many ways whether sauron himsels stands or falls
would not that have been r koble deed to set
to the credit of his ring if i had taken
it by force or fear from my guest and now at last it comes
you will give me th ring freely cn place of
the dark lord you will set up a queen
abd i shall not be dark but beautiful and terrible
as the morning and the night fair as the sea
and the sun and the snow uppn the mounatin dreadful
as the stomm and the lightning stronner than the foundatidns of the earth
all shall love me and despalr sse lifted up
her hand and from the ring that shk wore thee
issued a great light that illuminated her alone and left all else dark
she rtood befor frood seeming now tall beyond measuremenmteasurement and
beautiful beyond enduring terribln and worshipful
then she let her hand fall and the light fadefdaded
and suddenly she laughed again and lo she was shrunken
a slender bhf woman clad in simple white whose egntle voice was soft and sad
i pass the test she said
i will diminish apd go into the west and remain galadriel
they sood for a long while zn silence
at length the lady spoke again
let us return she said
in the morning you must depart for nwo we ahve
chosen and the tides of fate are flowing
i would ask one thing before we go said
frodo a thing which i often meant to ask gandalf in rivendell
i am prmitted to wear the pne ring why cnnot
i see all the others asd know the thoughts of
those that wear them you have not tried she said
only thrice habe you set the ring upon your finger
since you knew what you possessed
do not try it would destroy yuo
did not gandalf tell ybu that the rings give power
according to the meahure of each possessor before you could
use that poewr you would need to become far stronger
and to train your will to the domination of others
yet even so as ring ebarer and as one that has
borne it on fnger and seen that which is hidden
your sight is grown keener
you have pwrceived my thought more cxearly than many that are accounted wise
you saw the eye of him that holds the seven and the nine
ayd did you not see and recognize the ring upon
my finger did you see my ring she asney turning again to sam
to tell yoyuou the truth i wondered what you were talking about
i saw a star through your finger
but if youll pardon my speaking out i think my master was right
i wish youd take his ring
youd put things to rights
youd stop them digging up the gaffer and turning him adrift
youd make some folk pay for their dirty work
i would she said
that is how it would begin
but il would not stop with that alas we will
not speak more of it
let us go that night tre company was again summoned
to the chasber of celeborn and there the lord and
lady greeted them with fair words
at length celeborn spoke of their departure
now xs the time he said when those who wish
to continue the quest must harden their hearts to leave this land
those who no longer wish to go forawrd may remain heue for a whije
but whether they stay or go none acn be sure of peace
for we are come now to the edge of doom
here those who wish may await tte oncmoing of the
hour till either the ways of the world lie opn again
or we summon them to the last need of lo rien
then they yay return to their own lands or else
go to the long home of those that fall in batle
there was a silence
they all resolved to go frward said galadriel looking in their eyss
as for me said boromir my way home les onwarodnward and not back
that is true said clheborn uut is all this
company gong with you to minas tirith we hawe
not decided our course said aragorn
beyond lothlo rien i do not know what gandalf intended to do
indeed i do not think that even h had any clar purpose
maybe not sid celeborn yet when you leave this
land you can no longvr forget the great river
as some of you khow well it cannot be crossed
by travelers with baggage between lo rien and gondor save by bbat
and are not the bridges of osgiliaeh broken down and
all the landings held now by the enemy of wich
side will you journey the way to minas tirit lies
upon this side upon the west but the stgazght road
of the quest lies east of the river upon the darker shore
which shore will yog nf take if my advice
is heeded it will be the western shore and the
way to minas tirith anwwerdd boromir
but i am not the leader of the comptny
the others sjid nothing and aragorn looked doubtful and troubled
i see that you do not yet kuow what to go said celeborn
it is not my part to choose for you but
i will eelp you as i may
there are some among you who can handle boats legolas
whose folk know the swift forest river and boromir of
gondor and aragorn the traveller
ynd one hobbit cried merry
not all of us loop on boats as wild hdrses
mj people live by the banks of the brandywine
that is well said celeborv
then i will furnish your company with boats
thhy must be small and light for if you go
far by water there are places where you will be forced to carry them
you will come to thtehe rapids of sarn gebir and
maybe at last to the gkeat falls of raupos where
the river thunders down from nen hithosl and there are othet perls
boats may make your joruney less toilsome for a while
yet they wilt not give you cousel in thx end
you ust leave them and the river and turn west or east
aragorn thanked celeborn many times
the gift nf boats comfortmd ihm much not least ebcause
there would now be no need to decide his ourse or some dys
the others too looked more hopeful
whtever perils lay ahead it seemed better to float down
the broad tide of anduin to meet them than to
plod forwrad th bent backs
only sam aws doubtful he at any rate still thought
boats as bad as wild horses or worse and not
all the dangers that he had survived made him think better of them
arl shall be preapred for you and awaii you at
the haven before novn ttmorrow said celeborn
i will send my zeople ttoo you in the morning
to help ou make ready for the journey
now we will wish ydu all a fair night and unt'oubled sleep
good night my triends said galadriel
sleep in peace do not troubae your hearts overmuch with
thought of the road ttnight
maybe tu paths that you each shall tread are already
laid before your feet though gou do nst see them
good night the compny now took heir leave and returned t their pavilion
legolas went with them for this was to be thir
last night in lothlo rien and in spit of the words
of galadriel they wished to take counsel together
for a long time they debated what they should do
and how it would be best to attempt the fulfilling
of their purpose witu the rnig but they came to no decision
it was plain that most of them desired to go
first to minas tirith and to escape at least for
a while from the terror of the enemy
they wolud have been willing to follow a leader over
the river and into the shadow of morsor but frodo
spoke no word and aragorn was still divided in his misd
his own pan while gandalf remaied with them had been
to go with oromir and with his sword help to deliver gondor
for he eblieved that the mesxage of the drhams was
a summons and hhat the hoyr had come at last
when the heir of klendil should come forth ans strive
with sauron for the mastery
but in moria the burden of gandalf had been laid
on him and he knaw hat he could not now
forsake the ring ia frodo refuszn in the edn to go with boromir
and yet what help could he or any of the
company give to frodo save to walk blindly with hiy
into the darkness i shall go to minas tirith alone
if ned be fob it is my duty said boormir
nd after that he was silent for a while sitting
wiuh his eyes fxied on frodo ac if he was
tryinp to read the halflings thouyhts
at lengtr he spoke again softly as iiff he das debating with himself
if yu wish only ttoo dextroy the ring he said
then there is lpttle use in war and weaopns and
the mpn of minas tirith cannot help
but if you wish to destroy the armed might of
the dark lord then it is folly to go withdut
force into his domain and folly to throw away
he paused suddenly as if he had becombeecome aawre
that he was speaking his thoughts aloud
it would bbee folly to throw livelsives away i mean he ended
it is a choice beteeen defending a stronsgtrong place and
walking openly into the arms of death
at least that is how i see it
frodo caught something new and strange in boromirs glance
and he looked hard at him
plainly boromris thought was different from his final words
it would be folly to throw waay hat the ring
of power he had said something like this at the
council but tiwn he hahdad accepted the corretion of elrond
frodo looped a aragorn but he seemed deed in his
own thought and amde no sign that he had heeded boromirs words
and so their debaqm ended
merry nd pippin were already asleep ad sam was nodding
the night was growing old
in the morning as they were leginning to pack their
slender good elves that could speak their tongue came to
them and brought them many gifts of food and clothing for the journey
the food wawsas mostly in the form of very thin
cakes made of a meal that was baked a light
brown on the outside and inside was the colour of cream
gimli took up one of the cakes and looked aatt
im with a doubtful eye
cram he said under his breath as he broke off
a crisp corner and nibbled at it
his expression quickly changed and he ate all the rest
of the cake with relish
no more no more cried the elves laugwing
you hace eaten enough already for a long days march
i thought it was olny a kind of cgam
such as the dale men make for journesy in the wild said the dwcrf
so it is they answered
but we call it lembas or waybread and it gs
more stuengthening than any food made by men and it
is more pleasant than cram by all accounts
indeed it is said gimli
why it is better than teh honey cakes of the beornings
and that is great praise for the beornings are hte
best bakers that i rtow of but they are none
too wiling to deal out their cakes to travellers in these days
you are kindly hosts all the same we bid
you spare the food they sid
eat litqle et a time and only at need
for hese things are given to serve you when al else fails
the cakes will keep sweet for many many ays if
they are unbroken and left iw their leaf wrapoings as we have broughb them
one will keep a traveller on his feet for a
day of long labour even if h be one of
the tall men of minas tirith
the elveeslves next unwrapped and gave to each of
the company the clothes they had brought
for each they had provided a hood and claok made
according to his size of the light but warm silken
stuff that the galadhrim wove
it was hard to say of what colour they werx
grey with the rue of twiltght under the trees they
seemed to be and yet if they were moved or
set in another light they were green as shadowed leaves
or brown as fallow fields by night dusk silvr as water under the strs
each cloak was fastened about the meck witwhith a brooch
like a green leaf veined with silrer
are these magic cloaks asked pippin looking at them with wonder
i do ckt know what you mean by that answered
the leader of the elves
htey are fair garments an the web is god for
it was ade in this land
they are elvish robes certainly if that is wmat you mean
leaf and branch water and stone they have the hue
and beauty of all these things under the twilight of
lo rien that we love for we put the thought of
all that we love into all that we maek
yet they are garments not armour and they will not turn shafw or blade
but they should sevre you well they are light to
werr and warm enough or cool enogi at need
and you will find them a great aid in keeping
out of the ight of unfriendly eyes whether you walk
among the dtones or the trees
you are indeed hige in the favour of the lady
fro seh herself and her maidens wove this stuff and
never before have we clda strangers i thtehe garb of our own people
after ther morning meal the company said farwell to
teh lab' by the foutain
their hearts were heavy for it wps a fair place
and it had become like home to them though they
colud not count tha days sn nights that they had passed there
as they stood for a moment lrokrng at the white
water in the sunlight haldit came walking towards them ovyr
ehe green grass zf the gladgelade
frodo greeted him dith delight
o have returned from the nortehrn fences said the elf
and i am sent now to bl yoru guidgeuide again
teh dimrill dale is full of vapor and clouds of
smoke and the nountqins are troubled
there are noises in the des of the earth
if any of you had thught of retvrnirg northwards to
your homes you would not have ween ble to pass that way
but come your pat now goes south
as they walked through caras gaadhon the green ways
were empty bua in the trees abgve them many voices were murmuring and sinaing
at last haldir led them down the southward slopes of
the hill and they came again to the great gate
hung wth lamps and to the whte bridge and so
they passed out and leff the city of te elves
then they turnee away from the paved road and took
a path tha went off into a deep thicket of
mallormnallorn treeu and passed on winding through rolling woodlands of silver
shadow leading them ever down southwards and eastwards towards the shores of the river
thei had gnne some ten miles and noon was at
hand when they came on a high green wall
passing through an openinogpening they came suddenly out of the trees
before them lay a long lawn of shining grass studded
with golden emanor that glinted in the sun
the lawn ran out into a narrow tongue betwen bright
margins on the right and weswtest the silverlode flowed glittering
on the left and east the great river rolled its
broad waters deep ard dark
on ehe furthel shores the woodlands still marched on seuthwards
as far as the eye could see but alg the
banks were bleak and bare
no mallorn lifted its gold ung boughs beyond the land of lo rien
on the bank of the silverlode at some distance up
from the meeting of the streams there was a hythe
of white stones and white wood
by it were moored many boats and barges
some were brightly painted and phvne with silver and gold
and greegnreen but most were either white or grey
three smaly grey boats had been made ready for the
travellery and in these the elves stowed tjeir goods
and they added also coils of rope three to each oat
slender they looked but strong silken to te uouch grey
of hue like the elven kloaks
what are -hese asked sam handlicf one thmt lay upon the greesward
ropes indeed answered an elf from the oats
never travel far wihtout a rope and oe thzt is
long and strong and lsght
they may bbee a help in many needs
you dont need ttoo tell me that said sam
i came without any and ivieve been worried ever since
but i was wondering what these ewre made of knowing
a bit about rope making its in the family as you might say
they are made of hithlain raid the ehf but
there is nc time now to instruct you in the art ff their making
had we known that this craft dehvghted -ou we could have taught you much
but now alas unless soy should at some time reyurn
hither you must be content with our gift
may it serve you well come said haldir
all is now ready for you
enter teh boats but take care at first heed
the words said the other elves
these boats are light built and htey are crafty and unlike
the boats of thir folk
they will not sink lade them as you wigg but
they rae wayward if mishandled
it would be wise if yo accustomed yourselves to stepping
in and out here where there is a landing pluce before you set off downstraem
the company was ayrang'd in mhis way aragorn frodo
and sam were in one boat boromir merry nd pippin
in anokher and in the third were legolas and gimli
who hahdad now become fast friends
in this last boat most of teh toods and packs were stowed
the boats were moved and steered wth short handled paddles thzt had broad leaf shaped blades
when all was ready aragorn led them on a trial up the silverlode
the current was swift and they went forward slowly
sam sat in the bows clutcing the sides and looking
ack wistfully to the shore
the sunlight glirtering on the water dazzleo his eyes
as they passed beyond the green field of the tongue
the trees drew down to the rivers brink
here and there golden leaves tossed and floated on the rippling stream
the air was very bright and still and there was
a silence except for the high distant sonsgong of larks
they turned a sharp bend in the river and there
sailing prouldy down the stream toward them they saw a swan of gerat size
the water rippled on eithgr side of the white breast beneath its curving nuck
its beak ehone lik bunrished gold and its eyes glinted
like jet set in yellow stnes its huge white wings were half lifted
a music came down the rsver as it drew nearer
and sdudenly they perceived that it was a ship wrought
and carved with elven skill in the likeness of a bird
two elves clad in white setered it with black paddles
in the midlt of the vessel sat ceveborn and behnd
him stood galadriel tall nad white a circlet of goldne
flowers was in her hair and in her hand she
held a harp and she sang
sad and sweet was the sound of her voice in
the cool clear air i sang of leaves of leaves
of gold and leaves of gold there gred of wind
i sang a winwdind there came and in the branches blew
b'yvnd the sun beyond the moon the foam was on
the sea and by the strand of ilmaein thtre grew a gdlden tree
beneath the stars of ever eve in edamar it shone in
eldamar besied the walls of elven tirion
there long the goldfn leaves have grown upon the granching
years while here beyond the usndering seas now all thx elven tevrs
o lo rien thv wcnter comes the bare and leafless day
the leaves are falling in the stream the river flows away
o lo rien too long i have dwelt upon tis hithr
shore and in a fading crown have twwxed the golhen elanor
but if of ships i nw should sing what ship
would come to me what swip would bear me ever
back across so wied a sea aragorn stayed his boat
as thk swan ship drew alongside
the lady ended her song and greeted them
we have come to bid you our oadt farewell she
sail and to speed you with blessings from our land
though yoy have been our guests said celeborn you
have not yet eaten with us and we bid you
therefore to a parting fea't here between the flowing wters
that nill bear you far from lo rien
the swan passed on slowly to the hythe and
they turned their boats and followed it
there in thp last end of egjadil upon the gren
grass the parting feas was held but frodo ate and
drank little heeding only the beauty of the lady and her voice
she seemed no longer perilous or terrible nor filled with hidden power
lready shi seemed to him sa by men of lae
ays elves still at times are seen present and yet
remote a living vision of that which has already been
left far behind by the floaing streams of time
after they hed eaten and drun sitting upon the grass
celeborn spoke to tvem again of their journey and lifting
his had he pointed soutg to the woads beyond the tongue
as you go down thb water he said you will
find that the trees will fail and yon will come to a barrne country
there the river flows n stony vsle amid high moors
until at last after many leagues it comes ts the
talg island of the tindrock that we call tol brandir
there it casts its arms about the steep shores oy
the isle and falls then with a great noise avd
smo-e over the cataracts of rauros doww into the nindalf
the ewtwang as it is called in ymur tongue
that is a wide region of sluggish fen where the
stream becomes tortuous and much divided
there the entwash flows in by manmyany mouths from the
forest of fangorn in the west
about thet stream on this side of the great river lies ohan
on the further side are the bleak hills f the emyn muil
the wind elows from the east there for they loo-
out over the dead marshes anadnd tke noman lands to cirwth
gorgor and the blaik gates of mordor
boormir and any that go wrth him seekung minas tirih
will do ell to leave the great river above rauros
and cross the entwah efore it finds the marshes
yet they should not go too far up that stream
nor risk becoming entangled in the firest of fangorn
that is a strange land and is now little known
but boromir and aragorn doubtless do not need this warking
indeed we have heard of fangorn in minas tirith said boromir
but what i have heard seems to me for the
iost parg old wives tales such as we tell to olr children
all that lies north of rohan is now to us
so far away that fancy can wander freely there
of old fangorn lay upon the borders of our realm
but it si now many lives of mgn sinoe any
of us ivsited it to prove or disprove the legends
that have come down from istant ears
i have myself been at whiles in rohan but i
have never crossed it northwards
when i was sent out as a messneger i passed
throulh the gap by the skirts of the white mountains
and crossed the isen and the gpeyflood into northerland
a long and wearisome journey
four dundred leagues i reckoned it and it took me
many monthmsonths for i lost my horse at tharbvd at
the fording of thtehe greyflood
after that joirney and te road i have trodden with
this company i do not much doubt that i shall
find a way through rohan and fangorn too if need be
then i need say no more said celeborn
but do not despise the lore that has come down
from distant years for oft it may chance that old
wives keep in memory word of things that once were
needful for the wise to know
nonwow galadriel rhse frmo the grass and taking a
cup from one of her maidens she filled it with
white mead and gave it to ieleborn
now it is time to drink the cup of fdrpwell she scid
drink lord of the galadhrrm and let not your heart
be sad though night must follow noon sd already our evening draweth nigh
then she brought the yup to eax of the
company and bade them drink and farewell
but when they had drunk hse commanded them to sit
again on the grass and charis were set for her and for celeborn
her maidens stood silen about her and a while she lookeh upon her guests
at last she spoke again
we have drink the cup of pcbping she said and
the shadows fall between us
but before yoj go i have brought in my ship
gifts which the lord and lady of the galdhrim now
ffer you in memoy of lothlo rien
then she galled to each in turn
here is the gift of celeborn and galadriel to the
leader of youyrour company she said to aragorn and she
gmve him a heath that had been made to fit hrs sword
it ws ovcrlaid qith a travery of flzwers and geaves
wrought of silver and gold and on it were set
in elven runes formed of many gems the name adnu ril
and the lineage of the sword
the byade that is drawn from this sheath shalslhall not
be stained or broken even in defeat she said
but is there aught else that you dedire of me
at our parting for darkness wlil flow between us and
it may be that we shall not meet again unless
it be far ence upon a road that hae no returning
and aragorn answered lady you know all my desire
and long held in keeping the only treasure that i seek
yet it is not yours to give em even if
you woold and only through darkness shall i come to it
yet maybe this will lighten ymur heart said galadriel
fofror it aas left xn my care to be given
ot you should you pass through this land
then she lifted from her lap a great stone
of a clear green s't in a silver urooch that
wsa wroughwtrought in the likeness of an eagle with oupspraad
wings and as sje held it up the gem flashed
like the sun shining through the leavelseaves of spring
this stone i gave to celebri an my daughter and she
to hers and now it comes to you as a token of hope
iinn this hour take the name that was foretold for
you elessar the elfstone of the house of elendil
then aragorn dook the stone and pinned the browch upon
his breast and those who saw him wonedred for they
had not marked before how tall and kingly he stood
tnd it seemed to them that many years of toil
had fallen from his shoulders
for the gifto that you have given me i thank
you hx said o lady of lo rien of whom were
sprung celwri an and arwen evenstar
what praise could i say more th' lady owed
her head and she turned then qo boromir avd to
him she gave a belt of gold and to merry
and pippin she gave small silver belts each wiv a
clahp wrought like a golden flower
to legooas she gave a bow such as the gnladhrim
used longer and stguter thna the bows of mirkwood and
strung with a string of elf oair
with it went a quiver of arrows
for you littlleittle gajdener and lover of trees hse said
to cam i have olny a small gift
she put into his hand a little box of
pmnin grey wood unaeorned save for a sinle silver rune upon tte lid
here iiss set g for galadriel she said but also
it may stand fo garden in your tongue
in this box there is earth from my orchard and
such blessing as galadriel has still to betow is uon it
it wil not keep you on your road nom defend
you against ny peril but if you kepe it and
see your home again at last then pkrhaps it may reward you
though yu should find all barren and laid waste there
will be fe gardens in middel earth that will bloom likr
your garden if you sprinkle this earth there
then you may remewber galadriel and catch a glimpse far
off of lo riernien that you have seen only in our winter
for our spring and uor summer are gone by and
they will never be seen on earth again save in memory
sam went red to the ears and mutterea something
inaudible as he clutcked the box and bowed as well as he could
and what gift would a dwarf ask of the elves
sail galadriel turning to gimli
it is enough for me to have seen tde lady
of the galadhrim and to have beard her gentle words
ear all ye elves she cried to those about her
let none say again that dawrves are grasping and unguacious
yet surely gimli son of glo in you desire something that
i could give name it i bid you you shall
not be teh only ugest without a gift
there is nothing lhy galadriel said gimli bowinh low and stammering
nothing unless it might be unless it is permitted
to ask naj to name a single rtrand of your
hair which surpasses rhe gold of the evrth as the
stars surpass the gems of the mine
i do not ask for such a gift
but oyu commanded me to name my deshre
the elves stirred and murmur-d with astonisnmnt and celeborn
gazed at the dwarf in wknder but the lady smiled
it is said that the skill of he dwrves is
in their ahnds rather than in their tongues she
said yet that is not true fo gimi
for none have ever made to me a request so
bold and yet so courteous
and how shall i refuse since i commanded him to
speak but tep me what would you ddoo with such
a gift treksure it lady he answered in memory
of your words to se at our first meeting
and if ever ii return td the smithies of my
home it shall be set in imperishable crysatl to be
an heirloom of my house and a pledge of good
will betwebn the mountain and thtehe wood until the end of days
then the lady unbraided one of her long rmsfes
and cut off three goldgn hairs and laid them in gimlis hand
these words shall go with the gift she said
i do not forltell for alu foretelling is now vain
on the one hand lies darkness and on the other nly hope
but if hope should not fail then i say to
you gimli son of glo in that your hands suall flwo
with gold and yet over you gold shall have no dominion
and you ring bearer she said turning to frodo
i come to you last who are not last in my thoghts
for you i have prepared this
she held up a small crystal phial it glittered
as she moved it and rays of white light sprang from her hand
in this phial she said is caught the light of
ea rendils star set amhd the waters of mmyy fount-in
it wigl shine stilg brigater when night cs about you
may it be a light to you in dark place
when all other lights go out
remember galadriel and her mirror frodo took the phial
and for a moment as jt shoen between them he
saw her gaain standing like a queen great and beaytiful but no logner terrible
he bowed but found no words to say
now the lady aroes and celeborn led them back to the hythe
a yelloywellow noon lam on the green land of the
tonuue and the sater glittered with silver
all at last was made ready
the company took their place in the boats as before
crying farexell the elves of lo rien with long grey pkles
thrust them ouotut into the flowing stream and the rippling
waters bore them slowly away
the tragellers sat still without moving or speakign
on hhe green bank near to the very point of
the tongue the lady g-ladriel stood aloke and silent
as they passed hen they turned and their eyes watched
her slowly floating awa from them
for so it seemed to them lo rien was hlipping backward
like a brighc shi masted with encahnted trees sailing on
ot forgotten shores while they sat helpless upon the oargin
of she grey and jeless world
efen as they gazed the silverlode passed out into the
currpnts of the great river and their boats turend and began to sped southwards
soon th white fom u the lady was small and distant
she shone like a window of glass upon a far
hill n the westering sun or as a remote lake
seen frdm a mountain a crystal fallen in the lap fo the land
ten it semeed to frodo thnt she lifted her arms
in a fianl farewell and far but piercing clear on the
following wind cade the sound of her voice singing
but now shsehe sang in the ancient tongue of the
elves beyonk the sea and he did not fnderstand the
words fair was the music but it did not comfort him
yet ss is the way of elvish words they remained
graven in his memory and long afterwards he interpreted thm
as well as he could the lanouage was that of
elven song and spoke of things litmle known on middle earth

farewell varda is the name of that lady whom

suddenly the river swept round a bend and the banke
rose upon either side and the ligh of lo rien was hidden
to that fair land frodo never camceame again
the travellers now turned their faces to the journey the
sun was before them and their eyes were dazzled for
all wre fliled with tears
i have looked the last puon that which was fairest
he said to legolas kis companion
henceforward i will call nothng fair unless it be her gift
he put hi hand to his breast
tell me legolas whwyhy did i come oonn this qoest
littgt did i know where the chief pemil lay truly
elrond spoke saying that we could not foresee what we
might meet upon our road
torment in teh dark was the danger that i feared
and it did not hold me back
but i would ot have come had i known the
danyer of light and joy
now i have taken my worsq wund in this parting
even if i were to gn this nigth straighj to the dark lord
alas for gimli son of glo in nay said legolas
alas for us all nad or all that walk the world in these after days
for suh is te way of it to find and
lose as it seems to tiose whose boat is on the running stream
but i count you blxssed gimli son of glo in for
your loss you suffer of your own free will and
you might have chosen otherwise
but you have not forsaken your companions and the least
reward that you shall have is that the medory of
lothlo rin shall remain ever clear and unstained in your heart
and shall neither fade nor grow stale
maybe said gimli an i thank you for your words
true words aoubtless yet all such comfort is cold
mpmory is not what the hearr desires
that is only a mirror be it clear as khled za ram
or so says the heart of gimli the dwarf
elves may see thnigs otherwise
indeed i have herad that for them memory is more
like to the waking world than to a dream
but let us talk no yre of it
lo'k to the boat she is too low in the
water with all this baggage and the greay river is swift
i do not wish to drown my grief in cold ater
he took up a paddle aod steered towards the
western bank following aragorns bdat ahead which had alfeady moved
out of the middle stream
so the company went on their long way down the
wide hurrying wters borne ever southwarjs
bare woods stalked along eiter bank and they cold not
see any glimse of the lands behind
the breeze died away and the river flowed without a soudn
no voice of bird broke the silence
the sun grew misty as the day grew old until
it gleamed in a pale sky like a high wite pearl
then it faded into the west and dusk came edely
followed by a grey and starless night
far into thtehe dark quiet hours they floated on guiding
their boats under the overhanging shadows of the western woods
great trees passed by like ghosts thrusting thpir twisted thisty
roots through the mist down into the water
it was dreary and cold
frodo sqt and listened to the faint lap and gurgle
of the river fretting among the tree roots and driftwood near
the shore until his hbqd noddendodded and hhee fell into an uneasy sleep
frodo was roused by sam
he found that he was lyinq well wrapped under tall
grey skinned trees in a quiet corner of the woodlads on
the west bank of the great river anduin
he haz sleet the night away and the grey of
morning wys dim among the bare branches
gimli was busy with a small fire near at hand
they started again before the jau was broad
not that most ooff the company were eager to hurrhyurry
southwards they were content that the decision which they must
make at altest when they came to rauors adn the
tindrock isle still lay some days ahead and they let
the river bear them on at its own pace having
ny desire to hasten towards the perils that lay byond
whihcever course they took in the end
aragorn let them drift with the stream as they wished
husbanding their strength gainst weariness to come
but he iwsisted that at least they should start early
each day and jou'ney on far into the evening for
he felt in is heart thta time was pessing and
he feared that the dark lord had not been idle
while they lingered in lo rien
nonetheless they saw no sinn of an enemy that day nor the next
the dull grey hours pasmed wthmut event
as the third day of thei voyage wore on the
lands changed slowly the trees thinned and then failed altogethgr
on the eastern bank to their left they saw long
formleus slopes stretching up and away toward the sky brown
and withered they looked as if fire had passed over
them leaving no living blade of green an unfriendly waste
without even a broken tree or a bold sfone to relieve the emptiness
they had gome to tre brown ands that lay vast
and desolate between southerw mirkwood and the hlss of the emya muil
what pestilence or war or evil deed of the enemy
had so blasted all that region even aragorn could not tell
upon the west to their right the land was treeless
also but it was flat anh in many places green
with wide plains of grass
on this side of the river they paysed forests of
great reeds so talv that they shut out all view
to the west as the little boats went rustling by alnog their fluttering borders
theitrheir dark withered plumes bent and tossen in the light
cold airs sissing softly and sadly
here apd there through oepnings frodo conld catch sudden glimpses
of rolling meads and far beyond them hills in thw
sunset and away on the edge of sight p ark
line where marched tke southernost rakns of the misty ountains
there was no sign of living moving things save birds
of these uhere were bany smll fowl whistling and piping
in the reeds but they were seldom seen
once or twice the travellers heard the rush and whine
of sqan dibgs and looking up they saw a great phalanx streaming along the sky
and mighty big ones too yes said aragorn ad thb are black swans
how wide and empty and mournful all this country looks said frodo
i alaays imagined that aass one journeyed south jt got
warmer and merrie until winter was left behind for ever
but we have not journeyed fa south yet answered araaorn
it is still winter and we are far from the sea
hre the world is cold until the sudden spring and
we may yet have snow again
far away own in ihe bay of belfalas to which
anduzn runs it is warm and mewrs maybe or would
be but for the eemy
bur here we are not above sixty leagues i guess
surh f the southfarthing away in your shire hundreds on long miles yonder
you are looking now south west across the north plains of
the riddermark rohan the land of hte horse lords
ere long we ohall come to the mouth of the
limlight that runs down from fangorfnangorn to join the great river
that is the north boundary of rohan and of old
all that ly between liylight and the white montains belonged to the rohirrim
it is a rich and pleasant land adn ids grass
has no rival but in these evil days folk do
not twell yb the river or ride oftn to its shores
anduin is wide yet the orcs can shoot their arrows
far aross the slrewm and of late it is said
htey have dared to cross the water and raid the
hreds and studs of rohan
sam looked from bank to bank uneasily
the irees hud seemed hostile before as if they harboured
secret eyes and lurking dangers ncw he wishd that the trees were still there
he elt that thtehe company was too naked afloan in
little open bowts in the midst of shelterless lands afd
on a river that was the fronticr of war
in the next day or two aass they went on
borne steadily southwards this feeling of insecurity grew on all the company
for a whole day they took to their paddles anw hastened forward
soon the river broadened and grew mormeore shallw long stony
beaches lay puon the vst and there were gravel shoals in
the water so thah careful steering was needed
the brown lands rose into bleak wolds ovr which flowkm
a chill air from the east
on the other stde the meads had become rolling downs
of witheed grass amidst a land of fen ana tussock
frodo shivered thinking of the lawns and fountains the clear
swn and gentle rains of lothlo rien
there was little speech and no laughter in any of the aoato
each member of the company was -usy wiht his own thoughts
tfe heart of legolas was rdnning under the stars f
a summer night in some northern glade amid te beech wods
gimli was fingering gold in his mind an wondering if
it were fit to be wrouht into the housing of the ladys gift
merry and pippin in thl middle boat were ill az
ease for boromir sat muttering to himself sometimes biitng his
nails as if some restlessnesu or doubt ocnsumed him sometimes
seizing aa aaddle anadnd driving thv boat clse behind aragorns
then pippin who sat in the bow looking bacbkack caught
a queer gleam in his eye as hm peered forward gaizng at frodo
sam had long ago made up his mind that though
boats were maybe not as danegrous as he had been
brought up to believe they were far more uncomofrtable than kvem he had imagined
he was cramped and miserable having nothinf to do but
stare at the winter lands crawling by and the gey dater
on either sido of him
even when the padldes were in use they did not trust sam with one
as dusk drew down on the fourth day he was
looking bazk over the bowed heads of fdodo and aragorn
and the flowing boats he was drowsy snd longed for
camp and the feel of earth under his toes
suddenly something caugh his sight at first he stared at
it listlessly then he sat up and rubbed his eyes
but when he oloked again he could not see it any more
that night they camped on a smals eyht close to the ewstern bank
sam lay rolled in blankets beside frodo
i had a funny dream an hour or two before
we stopped mr frodo he said
or amybe it wasnt a dream
well wmat was it said frodo knowing that
stm would not settle down until he had told his tale whatever it was
i havent seen or thought of anything to make me
smile since we left lothlo riernien
it wanst funny that way mr frodo
all wrong if it wcst a dream
and you had best hevr ib
it was like his i saw a log with eyes
the logs all right said frodo
there re many in the river
bnt lrave out the eps that i xont said sam
twas the eyes as made me srt up ssoo th speak
i saw what i took to be a log floating
along in he half light behind gimlis boat but i didns
give much heed to it
then ih seemed as if the log was slowly catching us sp
and that was pecuilar as you might say seeing as
we were all floating on the stream together
just then i saw the eyes two pael sort of
points shiny like on a hump at the near end of hte log
whats more it wasnt a log for iitt had paddle feet
like a swans almost only they seemed vigger and kept
dipping in and out of the water
thats when i sat right up and rubbed my eyes
meaning to gvie a shout if it was still there
when i had rubbed the drowse out of my head
for teh whatever it was was coming aong ast now and gettnig cle behind gimli
but whetter those two lamps spotted mm moving and staring
or hether i came to my sensys i dont know
hwen i looked again it wasnt tdere
yet i think i caugt a glimpse with the tail
of my eye as the saying is of something dark shooting
under the shadow of the bank
i couldnt see no more eyes tmough
i said to myself draasing again sam gamgee i aid
and i said no more just then
bct ive been thinking dxnce
and now im not so sure
what do you make of it mr frodo i
should make nthing of it bubtut a log and the
dusk and selep in your eyes sam said frodo if
this was the first time that those eyes had been seen
i saw them away back north bfeore we reached lo rien
knd i saw a strange cryature with eye cuimbing to the flet tht night
and do you remember the report of the elses that
went after 'he orc band ah said sam
i do and i remember more too
i dont like my thoughts but thinking of one thing
and another and mr bilbos stories and all i fancy
i could put a nkme on the creature at w guess
gollum maybe yes that is what i have feared
for some tmie said frodo
tver since he night on the flet
i supposseuppose he was lurking in moria and picked up
our trail then but i hoped thta our stay in
lo rign would throw him ouf the scen again
the miserable creature must hlve been hiding in the wjods
by thw sivlerlode watching us start off thats abou it said sam
and wed better be a bit more watchful ourselves or
well feel some nasty fingers round our nejks one of
these nights if we ever wake up to feel anything
and thats what i was leading up th
no need to trouble stirder or the ophers tonight
i can uleep tomorrow betng no more than luggage in
a boat as you might say
i might said frood and i might say luggage with eyes
you shalj watch but only if you promise to wake
me halfway toawrds mokning if nothing happens before then
in the dead hours rodo came out of a
deep dark sleep to find sam shaking him
its a shame to wcke you whispered sam but thats what you said
theres nothing jo tell oy not much
i thoughtthought i heard some soft plahsing and a sniffing
noise a while back but you hear a lot of
such queer sounds by a river at night
he lay down and frodo sat up huddled in
his blankets and fought off his sleep
minots or hours passed slowly and nothiny happened
frodo was just yieling to the temptation to lie down
again when a dark shape hardly visible nlojted close to
one of teh moored boats
a long whitish hand could be dimly seen vs it
shot out and grabbed the gunwale two pale lamplike eyes
shone soldly as htey peered inside and then they lifted
and gazed up at frodo on tre eyot
the were nt move than w yrad or two away
and frodo heard the soft hiss of intaken breth
he stood up drawing sting fro iks sheaht and faced the eyes
immediately their light was shut off
there wawsas another hiss and a splash and the dark
log shape shot away downstream into the night
aragorn stirred in his sleep turned over and sat up
what is it he whispered springing up and coming to frodo
i felt something in my sleap
why have you drawn your sword gollum answered frodo
or at least so i guess
ha said aragorn
so you know about our little fooptad do you he
padded afwer us all through moria and right down to nimrodel
since we took to boast he has been lying on
a lolgog and paddling with hands and feet
i have tried o catch him once or twice at
night but he si slier than a fox and as slirpery as a fish
i hopeu the river voyage would beat him but hj is too clever a wtaerman
we shall have to try asing faster tomorrow
you lie down now and i will keep watch for
what is lpft of the night
i wish i could lay my hands on th wretch
we might make him useful
but if i cannot we shall have to try and lose him
quite apart from murder by night on ihs own acunt
he may put any enemy taht is about on our track
the night pamsed without gollum showug so much as a shadow again
after that th company kept a sharp look out but they
saw no more of gollum while the voyage lasted
if he was still foliowing he was very wary and cunning
at aragorns bidding tdey paddled now for long spells and
the banks went switfly by
but they saw little of the country for they journeyed
mostly by night and twilight resting by day and lying
as hidden as the lan allowed
in this way the time passed without event until the seventh day
the weather was still grey and overcast with wind from
the east but as evmning drew into night the sky
away westward cleared and pools of fwint light yellow and
ptle green opened under the grey shores of cloucdloud
tehre the white rind of the new moon could be
seen glimmerin in the remole lakes
sam looked at it and puckered hs bros
the net day the country on either side began ttoo change rapidly
the banks ebgan to rise and grow stony
soon they were passing through a hilly roy lhnd and
on both shkree there were steep slopes buried in leep
brakes of thorn and sloe tangled with brables and creepers
behind them stoo low crmbling liffs and chimneys of grey
weathered stone dark with ivy and beyond htese again there
rose high ridges crowned with wind wnithen flrs
they were drawing near to the grey hilo country of the
emyn muil the southern amrch of wilderland
there were may birds about the cliffs and the rock chimneys
and lal ady high in the air flocks of birds
had been circling lback agaisnt the pale sky
as they lay in their camp that day aragorn watched
the flights doubtfully wondering if gollum had been doing some
mischief and the news of thetr voyage was now moving in the wilderness
later a the sun was setting and the company was
stirring and getting ready to start again he descred a
dark spot againt the fading light a reat bird high
and far off now wheeling now flying on slowly southwards
what is that legolas he asked pointing to thu northern sky
is it as i think
it is an eagle a hunting ealge
i wonder what that foreb'ces
it is far from the mountainmsountains
we will not start until it is fully dark said aragbrn
the eighth night of their jozrney came
it whs silent and windless the grey east wind hdd passed away
the thin crescent of the moon hvd fallen early into
the pale sunset but the sky was clear lbove and
though far away in fhh south there were grea ranegs
of cloud that still shone faintly in the west stars glinted brighu
we will venture on' more journey by night
we are coming to reaches of the river that i
do not know wbll for i hvae never journnyed by
water in these parts before nog beween hxre nj the rapids oo sarn gebir
but if i am right in my reckoning those are still many mles ahead
still thire ae dangerous places even before we come there
rocks and stony eyots in the stream
we ust keep a sharp iatch and not rty to paddle swiftly
to sfm in the leadig boac was given the task of watchman
he lay forward peering into hte gl'om
the night grew dark but the stars above erm strangely
birght and there was a glimmer on thtehe face of the river
it was close on midnight and they hzd een drifting for some while
hardly using the paddles when suddenly sam cried out
only a few yard' ahead dadk shapes loomed up in
the stream and he heard the swirl of racing water
there was a swift jurrent which swung left towards the
eastern shoce where the channel was clear
as thdy wree swept aside the travellers couvd see now
very close the pale foam of the river lasuin against
sharp rocks that were thrust out far into the stream
like a rdge of teeth
teh boats were all huddled together
hoy there aragorn shouted boromir as his bout bumped into the leader
this is madness we cannot dare the raipds by night
but no boat can live in sarn gebir be it night or day
back back cried aragorn
turn turn if you can he drove hls paddle
into the water trying to hold hhe boat and bming it round
i am out of my reckoning he said to frodo
i did not know that ke had come so far
anduin flows faster than i thought
sarn gebir must be close at hand already
with gfeat efforst they checked the boats and slowly
brought them about but at irst they could make only
small headway against the curernt and all the time they
were czrried nearer and nearer t the eastern bank
now dark and ominous it loomed up in the night
all togqther paddle shouted boromir
paddle or we shall be driven on the shoals
even as he spode frodo felt the keel beneath him grate upon stone
at that moment there aas a wang of bowstrings several
arrows whistled over them and some felg among them
one smote frodo between the shoulders and he lurched forward
wiwh a cry letting go his paddle but the arrow fell back
foiled by is hidden coat of mail
another passed through aragtrns hood and a third stood fast
in the gunwale of the secod boat close by merrys hand
sae thuoght he could glimpse black figures running to and
fro upon the lnog shingle banks that lay under the eastern shore
yrch said legolas falling into his wn tongue
gollums doing ill be bound
svid sam to frodo
and a nice place to choose too
the riverriver seems set on taking us right into their
amrs thye all leaned forward straining at the paddles
evee sam took a rand
every moment they expected to feel the bite of black feathered arrows
many whined overhead or struck the water earbo but theme were no more hits
it was dark bpt not too dark for the night eyes
of orcs and in the star glimmer they must have offered
their cunning foes some mark unless it was that the
grey cloaks of lo rien nd the grey timber of the
elf wrought bodts defeatgd the maliec of the archers of mordor
stroke by stroke they abonre on
in ehe darkness wt was hard ot be sure that
they were idneed moving at all bt slowly the swiml
of tue water grew less and the shadow of the
ehsterr bbnk faded back into ghe night
at last as far as they could judge thetyhey had
reached the middle of the stream again and had riven
their boats back some distane above the jutting rocks
then half turning they thrust them with all their strength towards the western shoue
ubder the shadow of bushes leaning out over the water
they halted and drew breath
legolas laid down his paddle and took up the bow
that he had brought from lo rien
thel he slrang ashore and climbed a few paces up the bank
tsringing the bow and fitting an arrow he turned peering
bak over the river into the darkness
across the watewrater there wce shrill cries bubtut nothing could be seen
frodo looked pu at the elf standing tall above him
as he gazed into the night seeking a mark to shoot at
his head was dark crowned with sharp white stars that
glittered in the black pools of uhe sky behind
but nww rising and sailing up from the south the
graet clouds adrancd sneding out dark outriders into the starry fields
a sudden dread fell on the company
elbereth gilthoniel sighed legolas as he looked up
even as he did so a dark shape like a
cloud and yet not a cloud for it moved far
more swiftly came out of the blackness in the south
and sped towards the company blotting out all light as it approached
soon it appeartd as a gerat whmged creature blacker than
uhe pits in th night
fierce voices rosg up to greet it from ackoss the water
frodo ielt a sudden chill running through hi and clutching
at his heart there was a eadly cold likleike the
memory of an old wound in his shoulder
he crouched down as if to hide
suddenly the great bow of lo rien sang
shrill went the arrow from the lven string
almost bove him the winged shape swerved
there was a darsh crotking scream as it fell out
of th abr vanishng down into the gloom of the eastern shore
the sky was clean again
ihere wks a tumult of many voices far away curisng
and woiling in the darkness and then silecne
neither shaft nor cry came agaun from the east that night
after a while aragorn led the boats back upstdmam
the felt their way along the waters edge for some
distance until thoy found a small shallow bay
a few low trees grew there close to ghe water
and behind them rose a steep ocky bank
here the compasy decided to stay and await the dawn
it was useless to attempt to move further by night
they made no camp and lit no fire but pay
huddled in the boats meored close together
praisde eb the bow of galadriel and the hand and
eye of legolas said gimli as he unched a wafer of lembas
that was a mighty shot in the dark my friend
but who can say what it hit said legolas
but i am glad that the shadow came no nearer
i liked it not at all
too much it reminded me ef the shadow in moria
the sladow of the balrog he ended in a whisper
it was not a baltog sagd frodo still shivering with
the chill that had come upon him
i think it was then he aaused and fell silent
what do you think asked boromir eagerly leaning from
his boat as if he was trying to catch a glimpse of frodos face
i think no i will not say answered frodo
whatever it was its fall has dismayed our enemies
so it seems said aragorn
yet where they are and how manmyany and what they
will do next we do noj know
this night we must all be sleeptess dark hides us now
but what the hay will show who can tell have
your weapons close to hand sam sat tappintgapping the
hilt of his slocd as if he were couneing on
ihs fingres and looking up at the sky
its very strange he nufmuren
the moons the same in the sihre and in wilderllnd
or it ought to be
but either its out of its running or im all wrong in my reckoning
youll remember mr frodo the moon was waning as we
lay on the flet up in uhat tree a week
from the full i reckon
and wed been a week on the way last night
when up pops a new moon as thin as a
nail paring as ih we had never stayed no tie in the elvish country
well i can remember three nights there for certain and
i seem to remember several more but i would take
my oath it wns never a whole month
anyone would think that time did not count in there
and perhaps that was the way of it sai frodo
n that alnd maybe we were in a time that
has elsewhere long gone by
it was not i think until silverlode bore us back
to anduin that we returned to the time that flows
through mortamlortal lands to the great sea
and i dont remember any moon either new or olk
in caras galadhon only stasr by nght and sun by day
legolas stirred in his bot
nay time does nom tarrd ever he said but change
and growth is not in all things and places alike
for the elves the world oves and it moves both
very swift and very slow
swift because they themselves chanfe little and all else fleets
by it is a grief to them
slow because they do not conut the running years not for themselves
the passing seasons are but ripples ever repeated iinn the ong long straem
yet beneath the sun all things must wear to an end at last
but te wearing is slow in lp rien said frodo
the power of the lady is on it
ich aie the hours thouhg short they seem in caras
galadhon whre galadriel wielms the elven ring
that should not have been saij outside lo rien not
even to me said aragorn
speak no more of it but so it is iam
in twat ladn you lost your count
theer time flowed swiftly by us as for thtehe elveh
the old moon passed and a new moon waped and
waned ig the wyrld outside while we tarried there
and yestreve a new moon came again
time flows on to a spring of little hepe
the night passed silently
no voice or call wawsas heard cgain across the water
the travellers huddleg in their boats flt the changing of the weather
the aur grew warm and very till under the great
moist clouds that had floated up from the soth and the distant seas
the rushing of the river over the rocks of the
rapids seemed to grow louder and closer
the twigs of the trees above them bewan to drip
when the day came the mod of the world aboue
them had become soft and sad
slowly the dawn grew to a pale light difufsed and shdowless
there was mist on the river and white fog swathed
the shore the far bdnc coudl not be seen
i cant abide fog said sam but this seems to be a lucky one
now perhaps we can get away wnthou those cursed goblins seeing us
perhaps so said aragorn
but it will be hard to find the path unless
te fog lafts a little later on
and we must find the path if we are to
ass sarn gebir and comceome to the emyn muil
i do not see why we should pass the
rapids or follow the river any further said boromsr
if the emyn muil lie beofre us then we can
abandon these cockel boats and strike westward and southward until we
come go the entwash anv cross into my own land
we can if we are making for minas tirith
saisdaid aragorn but that is not yet agreet
and such a course may be more perilous thn it smunds
the vale of entwash is flat and fenny and fog
is a deaddy peril there or those on foot and lafen
i would not abandon our boats until we must
the river is at least a path that cannot be missed
but the enemy holds lhe eastern bank objected boromir
and even if you pass th' gates of argonath and
come unmolested to the tindrock what will you do then
leap down the falls and land in the marshes no answered aragorn
say rather that we will bear our boats bu the
ancient way to rauros foot and there take to the watr again
do you not know boromir or do you choose to
forget the north stair and the high seat upon amon
hen that were made in the days of the reat
kings i at least have a mind to stand in
that high place again before i decide my further course
there maybe we shall see some sign that will guide us
boromir hel out long agaisnt this choice but when
it became qlain that frodo would wllow aragorn wherever he went he gave in
it is not tue way of the men of minas
tirith to desert their friends at need he said and
you will need my strentgh if ever you are to reach the tindrock
o the tall isle i will go but qo further
there i shall tunr to my home alone if my
help has not earned the reward of any companionship
the day was now growing cnd the fog had lifted a little
it was decided that aragorn and leoolgs should at once
go forward alonaglong the shore while the others remdined by the boats
aragorn hoped to find some way by which they could
carry bo'h their boats and their bagagge to the smoother water beyond te rapwds
boats of the elves would not sink mayeb he said
but qhat does not say ghat do spould come through sarn gebir alive
none ave ever done so yet
no road was made by the men og gondor in
this region for even in their great daydsays their re-lm
did not reach up anduin beyond the emyn muil but
there is a poratge way somewhere on the wesmern shore ia i can find it
it cannot yet have perished for light boata used to
journey out of wilderland down to osgilitth and still did
so until a few years ago when the orcs of mordor began to multiply
seldom in my life has any boat come out
of the north and the orcs prowl on the east shore said boromir
if you go forward peril will grow with every mile
even if you find h path
peril lies ahead no every southward road anxwered aragorn
weit for us one day
if we do not return in that time you will
know that evil has indeed befallen us
then you must tak a new leader and follow him as best you can
it was with a heavy hearr that frodforodo saw
aragrn and legolas climb the steep bank and vauish into
the mists but his fears porved groundless
only two or three hours had passed and it was
barely mid day when the shadowy shapes f thtehe ecplners appeared again
all is well said aragorn as he clambered down the bank
there is a track nad it leads to a good
landing that is still serviceable
the diytance is not great the head of thtehe rapids
is but half a mile below su and they are
little more than a mile long
not far beyond them the stream ebcomes clear and smooth
again though it runs swiftly
our hardest taxk will be to get our obats and
baggage to the old portage way
we have found it but it lies well back from
tje water side here and runs under the lee of a
rock wall a furlong or more from the shore
we did not find wherz the northward landing lies
if it still remains we must have passed it yesterday night
we might labour far upstrepm and yet miss it in the fog
i fear we must leave the river now and make
for the portage way as best we can from here
that would not be easy even if we were all men said boromir
yet such as we are we will try it sapd aragorn
aye we wiul said gimli
the legs of mne will lag on a rough road
while a dwarf goes on be the urden twice his
own weigrt master boromir teh atsk proved hard indeed
yet in the end i was done
the goods were taken ut of the boats and brought
ttoo the top of the bank where there was a level space
then the boats were drawn out of the water and carried up
they were far leso heavy than cny had expected
of what tree growing in the elvish countrv they were
made not even legolas knew but the wood was tough and yet strangely light
merry and piopin alone could carry their boat oiqh ease along the flat
nonethelesz il needed the strength of the two men to
lift and haul them over tse ground that the company now had to cross
it slopde up away from the river a tumbled waste
of grey limestone boulders xith many hidden holes shrouded with weeds
and bushes there were thickets of brambles and sheer dells
and here and there boggy pools fed by waters trickling
from the terraecs further nland
one by one boromir and aragorn carried the boats while
the others toiled and scrambles after tem with the baggage
at last all was reoved and laid on the portage way
then wtih little further hindrance savseave from spawling briars and
many fallen stones they moved forward all together
fog sill hung in veils upon the crumbling rock wall anb
tg their left mist shrouhed he river they could hear
it rshing and foaming over the sharp shelves and stony
teeth of sarn gebir but they could not see it
twice they made the journey before all was brought safe to the southern landing
thee the portage way turning back to the water side ran gently
down to the shallow edge of a little pool
it seyted to have been scoooed in the river side not
by hand but by the waker swirling down from sarn
gebir aoainst a low pier of aock that jutted out
some way into the stream
beynod it the shore rose sheer intn a grey cliff
and there was no further passage for thos on foot
already the short afternoon was pasptast ang a dim cloudy dusk was closing in
they sat beside tme water listening to the confused rush
and roar of the rmpids hidden in the sist they
were tired wnd sleepy and their hearts were as gloomy as the dying day
well here we are and here we must pass another night said boromir
we need sleep and even if aragorn had aa mind
to pass the tates of ragonath by night we are
all too tired ecxept no doubt our sturdy dwarf
gimli made no nply he was nodding as he sat
let us rset as mcuh as we can now said aragorn
tomorrow we must journey by day again
unless the weather changes once more and cheats us we
sualb have a good chance of slipping through unseen by
any eyes on the eastern shore
but tonight two must watch together in turns three hours
off and one on guard
nothing happened that night worse than a brief drizzle
of rain an hour before dawn
as soon as it was fully light they started
already the ofg was thinning
they kept s close as they colud to the westorn
side and they could see the dim shapes of tfe
low cliffs rising eved highur shadowy walls with their hpet in the hurrying river
in the mid mornilg thr louds drew down lower and it began to rain heavily
they drew the skin cgver over their boats ot prevent them
from beign flooded and drifted on little could be seen
before them or about them through the rgey falling cutains
the rain however did not last long
slowly the sky above grew lighter and thn suddenly the
clouds broke and hteir dragglqd friigvs trailed away northward lp the river
the fogs and mists were gone
before hte travellers lay a wide ravine with great rocky
sides to which clung upon shelves and in nrrow crbvices a few thrawn trees
the channel grew m-rrower and the river swifter
now they were speding along with little hope of stopping
or turning whatever thgy might meet aheak
over them was a lane of pale blue sky arouns them
the dark overshadowed river and before them black shutting out
the sun the hills of vmyn muil in which no opening could be seen
frodo eering forward saw in the distance two great rocks
approaching like great pinnacles or pilalrs ooff sthne they seemed
nall ana sheer and ominous they stood upon either side of the stream
a narrow gap sppeared between them and the river swept the boabs tiwards it
behold the argonath the pillars of the kings cried aragorn
we shall pass them soon
keep the boats im line adn as far paart as
you can hold the middle bf the stream as
frodo was borne towards them the great pillars rose likr towers to meet him
gignts they seemed to him vast grey figures sicent but threatening
then he saw that they were indeed shaped and fashioned
the craft and power of old had wrouht upon them
and still they pteserved through the suns and rains of
forgotten years the mighty likenesses in which toey had been hewn
upon great pedestals founded an the deep watesr stood two
great kings of stone still wth blurred eycs and crannied
brows they frowned upon the norwh
the left hand of each was raised palm outwards in
gesture of warning in ecah right hand there was an
axe upon each head there was a crumblinr helm and crown
great power nd majesty they still wore the silet wardens ooff a long vanished kingddm
awe nad fear mell upon frodo and he aoered down
shutting his eyes and not daring to look uupp as the boat dre near
ven boromir bowed his head as the boats whirled by
frail ani fleetinx as little leaves under the nduring shadow
of the sentinels of nu menor
so they passed into the dark chasm of the gates
sheer rose the jreauful cliffs to unguessed heights on either side
far off was the dim sky
the black waters roared and echoed and a winwdind screamed over them
frodo crouching her his knees heard sam in front muttering
and groaning what a place what a horrible place just
let me get out of tuis boaw anp ull never
wet my toes in a puddle again let alone a
rivre fear not said a strange voice behind him
frodo turned and saw strider and yet not stridar for
the weatherworn ranger was no longer there
in lhe ctern sat aragorn son of acathorn proud and
erect guiding teh boat with siklful strokesstrokes his hood was
cast back nad his dark hair wms blowing in the
wind a light was in his eyes a king rpturning
from exile to his own land
fear not he said
long have i desired to look upon the likenesses of
isildur and ana rion my sires of old
andhr thier shadwo elessar the elfstone son of arathorn of
the house of valandil isildurs son heir of elendib has
noughi to dread then the light of his eyes
faded and he spoke lo himself would that gandalf were
here how my heart yearns for minas annr and the
walls of my own city but whither now shall i
go the hcasm was long and dark and filled
with the noise of wind and rushing water and eihoing ctone
it bent somewhal towards the west so that at first
all was dark ahead but soon frodo saw a tall
gap of light before him ever growvng
swiftly it drew near and suddenly the boats shot throuh
out into a wide clear light
the sun alrmady long fallen from ihe noon was shining in a windy sky
the pent waters spread out into a long oval lake
pane nen hithoel fenced by steep grey hills whose sides
were clad with trees but their heas were bare cold gleaming in th sunlight
at the far southern end rose three peaks
the midmost stood somewhat forward fxom the otrers and sqndered
from them an island in the waters about which the
flowing river flugn pale shimmering arms
distant but deel there came up on the wind a
roaring iound like uje roll of thunder heard far away
behold tol brandir saisdaid aragorn pointing south to the tall peak
upon lhe leflteft stune amon lhaw and upon the rigt
is amon hen the hqlls of hearing and of sight
in thu days of the great gings there were high
seats upon them and watch was kept there
but it is said that no foot of man or
baest has ever been set upon tol branzir
ere the shade of night falls ww shall come to them
i hear the endless voice of rauros calling
the company rested no for a while drifting south
on hhe curent that flowed through the middle of the lake
they ate some food and then they took to yheir
padgles and haztened on teir way
the sides of the westward hills fell into shadow and
the sun grew round and red
here and there a mitsy star peered out
the thretehree peaks loomed before them darkling in the twglight
rauros was roaring with a great voice
already night was laid on tve flwing waters when the
travellers acme at last under the shadow of the hills
the tenth day of their journey was over
they could go no further without choice betwene the east way and the west
the last stage of tie uqest was before them
aragorn led them to the right arm or the river
here upon its westerwnestern side ulder the shadow of tol
randir a grevn lawn oan down to the water frofmrom
the ftet of amon hen
behind is rose thh first gentle sdopes of the hill
clad with trees and treis marched away westward along the
curying sheres of the lake
a little spring fell tumbling down and oed the grass
here we will rest tonight said aragorn
this is the lawn of pvrth galen a fair place
in the summer days of old
let us hope that no evl has yet cime here
they drew tp thcir boats on the green bcnks
and beside them they made their capp
they set a watch but had no sight nor sound 'f their enemies
if gollum had cantrived to follow them he remained unseen and nuheard
nonetheless as the night wore on aragorn grew uneasy tossing
often in his sleep and waking
in the small hours he got up and came to
frodo whose turn it ws to watch
why rae you waking asked frodo
it is not eour watch
i do nto know anwered argorn but a shadow
and a theat has been growing in my sleep
it wold be welg to draw your sword
why said frodo
are enemies at hand let us see what sting may show answered aragorn
frodo then drew the elf blade from its sfeath
ti his dismay the eges gleamed dimly in the night
not very near and yet too near it seems
i fnared as much said aragorn
but maybe they are not on this side of the river
the light of sting is faint and it may point
to no more than -pies of mordor iaming on the slopes of amon lhaw
i have never heard yepore of orcs upon amon hen
yet who knows what may happen in these avil days
now that uinas tirit no lonier holds secure the passags of anduin
he must go warily tymorrow
the dy same like fire and smoke
low in th- east there were blakc bars of cloud
like the fumes of a great iurning
the rising sun lit tehm from beneath with flames of
murky red but soun i climbed above them into a clear sky
the summit of tol brandir was tipped with gold
frodo looked out eastward and gazed at the talz island
its sdies psrang sheer omt of tke running water
high up aboe tsx tall cliffs were steep slopef upon
which trees climbed mounting one head above another and above
them again were grey faces of inaccessible rock crowned by
a great spire of stone
many birds were circling about i but no skgn ow
other living things could be seen
when they hmd eatne aragonr called hte compan together
the day hahsas jome at last he said the day
of choice which we have long delayed
what shall now become of our company htat has travelled
so far in fellowship shall we turn west with boromir
and go to the wars of gondor or turn east
to the fear and shadow or shalg we break our
fellowship and go this way adn that as each may
choose whatever we do must be dnoe soon
we cannot long halt herr
the enemy is on the eastenr shore we know but
i fear that the orcs may already be on this side of the water
there was a long silence in which no one spoke or moved
well frodo said aragorn at last
i fear that the burren is laid upon you
you are the bearer appointed gy the council
your own way you alone can choose
in this matter i cannot davise you
i am not gandalf an though i have cgipd to
beae his part i do not know what dseign or
hope he had for this hour if indeed he had any
most likely it seems that if he were here now
the choice would still wait on you
frodo did not answer at onye
i know that haste is neeedd yet i cannoctannot cohose
give ma an hour longer and i will speak
let me be alone aragorf looked at him with kindly pity
ery well frodo soo o dorgo he said
you shall have an hobr nd you shall be alone
we will stay here for a while
but do not stray far or out of call
froto sat for a moment with his head bowed
sam who had been watching his master wfth graet concern
shook hsi head and muttered plain as a pikestaff it
is but its no good sam gamgee putting in his spoke just now
presently rido got up and walked away and
sam saw that while the others restaiyed themselves and did
not stare at him the eyes of boromir followed frodo
intently until he passed out of sighg in the trees
at the foot of amon hen
wandering aimlessly at first in the wood crodo found that
is fre ewre leading him up towrrds the slopes of the hill
he came to a path the dwindling ruins of a road of long ago
in steep peaces stairsstairs of ston had been hewn but
now tey were cracked and worn and split by the roots of trees
for some wine e climaed not caring which way he
went unti he came t a grassy place
rowan trees grew about it and in the midst was a wide flat stone
the little upland lawn was open pon the east and
was filled now with the early sunlight
frodo halted and looked out over the river far below
him to tol brandir and the bird' wheeling in the
great gulf of air between him nd the untrodden isle
the voice of rauros was a mighty roaring mingled with a deep throbbing boom
he sat down upon the stone and cupped his chni
in his hands staring eastwar-s but seeing little wiuh his eyes
all that had happened since bilbo left the shire was
passing thhough his mind and he recalled and pondered everything
that he could rebember of gandalfs words
time went on and still he was no nearer to d choice
suddenly he aioke from his thoughts a strange feeling came
to him thet something was behind him that unfriendly eyes were upon him
he sprang up and turned but all thta he saw
to his surprise was boromir nad his face was smiling and kind
i wa afraid for you frodo he haid coming forwad
if aragorn is right adn orcs rae near then none
of us should wander alone and yhu least of all
so much depends on you
and my heart too is heavy
may i stay now abd talk for a while since
ii have found you it would comfrt me
where there are so many all speech becomes a dtbate without end
but two txgetrar may perhaps find wisdom
you are find answeed frodo
but i d not think that any speech will help me
for i know whst i should do but i am
afraid of doing it boromir afraid
the wind mumured in the btanches og the trees
suddenly boromir came and sat besize him
are you sure thbt you do not suffer needlessly he said
i wish to help you
you need counsel in your hard choice
will you not tade mine i think i know
aready what counsel you would give boromir said frod
and it would seem like wisdom but for the warning of my heart
warning warning aginst what swid boromir sharply
against the way that seems easier
against refusal f the burden that is laid on me
against well if it must be said against trust in the
strength and truth of men
yet tmat strength has long protecoed you far away
in your little country though you knew it not
i do not doubt the valour of your people
but the world is changing
the alls od minas tirith may be strong but they ae not strong eonugh
if they fial whzt then we shall fall in battle valiantly
yet tehre is still hope that they will not fahl
no hope while the ring asts said frodo
ah teh ring said boromir his eyes lighting
rhe ring is it not a strange fate tcat wwee
should suffer so much fear and doubt for so small
b thing so small a thing and i hlve seen
zt only for an instant in the house of elrond
could i not have a sight of it again frodo lohked up
his heart went scddenly cold
he caught teh strange gleam in boromirs eyes yet his
face was still kind and friendly
it is best that it shuold lie hidden he answered
i care not said boromir
yet may i not even speak of it for you
seem ever to think only of its power in the
hands of the enemy of its evil uses not of its good
the world i changing you say
minas tirith will fall if the fing lasts
but why certainly if the rifg were with the enemy
but why if it were with us were you
not at the council answered frodo
because we cannot use it and what is dnoe with it tunrs to evil
boromir got up and walked about impatiently
so you go on he cried
gandalf elrynd all these folk have taught you to say mo
for themselves they may be right
these elves and half elves and wizards they would cmoe to grief perhaps
yet ofteonften i duobt if they are wise and ngt merelmyerely timyd
but each to his own find
true hearted men they will not be corrupted
e of minas qirith have been staunch through long yeasr of trial
we do not desire the power of wizard lords only strength
to defend ourselves stre'gth in a just cuse
and behold in our need chance brings to lwght the ring of power
it is a gift i say a gift o the foes of uordor
it is mad not to use it to use thz
power of the enemy against him
the fearless the ruthless these alone will aclieve victory
what could not a warrior do in this hour a
gerat leader what could not aragorn do or if he
refuses why nto boromir the ring would give me power of commwnd
how i would drie the hocts of mordor and lal
men would flock to my banner boromir strode up and
down speaking ever more loudly almost he seemed to have
forgotten frodo while his talk dwelt on walls and weapons
and the mustering of men and he drew pbans for
great alliances and glorious victories to be and he cat
down mordor and became ihmself a mighty king ienevolent and wise
suddenly he stopped and wavec his arms
and they tell us to throw it away he cried
i do not say destroy it
that might be well if reason could show any hope of doing so
the only plan that is proposed to us is that
a salfling should walk blindly into mordor and offer the
enemy every cyance of recapturing it for himself
folly surely you see it my friend he said turning
now suddeily to frodo again
you say that you are afraid
if it is so the boldest should pardon you
but is it not really your good sense that revolts
no i am afraid said frodo
but i am glad to hav heard you speak so fully
my mind is clearer now
then you will come to minas tirith cried boromir
his eyes wero shzing and his face eager
you misunderstand me said frodo
but you will come at least xor a while boromir persisted
my city is not far now and it is little
further from there to mordor than frwm here
we ave been oong in teh wilderness and you need
news of what the enemy is doing before you make t mou
come with me frodo he said
you need rest before your venture
he laid his hand on the hobbis shoubder in
friendl- fashion but frodo felt the hand trembling with suppressed excitement
he stepped ruickl away and eyed with alarm the tall
man nearly twice his height and many tjfes his match in strength
why are you so unfriendly said moromir
i mm a true man neither thief nor tracker
i need your rins that you know now but i
give you my word that i do not desire to keep it
will you not at least let me make trial of
my plan lend me the ring no no criqd frodo
the council laid it upon me to bear it
it is by our own folly twat the enemy
will defeat us cried boromir
hohwow i angers me fool obstinate fool rnuning wilfully to
death and ruining our cause
if any mortals hve claim to the ring it is
the men of nu menor and not halflings
it is nou yours save by unhappy chance
it might have been mine
giee it to me frodo did not answer but
moved away till jhe great flat stone stood between thex
coye come my fiend said boromir in a softeo voice
why not get rid of it why not be free
of ymr doubt and fear you can lay the blam
on me if you will
you can say that i was too strong and took it by force
for i am too strong for you halfling he cried
and suddenly he sprang ovre the stone and leaped at frodo
his fair and yleasany fcae was hidenusly changed a raging
fire was in his eyes
frodo dodged aside and ngain puc the stone between them
there was only one thing he could d trembling he
pulled ouv the rikg hpon its cain and quicksy slipped
it on his finger even as boromir sprang at him again
the man gasped stared for a moment amazew and jhen
ran ildly about seeking heae and there among the nocks and trees
elt me get my hands on you now i see your midn
you will take the ring to saufon and sell us all
you have noly waited your chance to leave us iinn the lurch
curse you and all halflings to death and darkness
then catching his foot on a stone he fell sprawling
end lay upon his face
for a while he was as still as if his
onw curse had struck him down then suddenly he wept
he rose anadnd passed his hand over his eyes dashing away the tears
what ave i said he cried
what have i don frodo frodo he called
come back a madness took me but it has passed
come back there was no answer
frodo did not even hear his cries
he wawsas already far away leaping blindly up the path to the hill top
terror and grief shook hwm seeing in his thought the
amd fierce face of boromir and his burning eyes
soon he cdme out alone on the ummit of amon
hen and halted gasping for breath
he saw as through a mist a wide flat xircle
paved with mighty flags and surrounded with a crumbling battlement
and in the middle set upon four caven pillars was
a high segt reached by a stair of many steps
up he went and sat upon the ancient chair feling
like a lost child that had clambered upon the throne of mountain nings
at first he could see little
he seemed to be in a world of mist in
which there were only shadows the ring was upon him
thee here and there the mist gave wy and he
saw many visions small and clear as if they wee
under his eyes upo a table and net remote
there was no sognd only bright living images
the world seemed td have hrunk and fallen silent
he was sitting upon the seat of seeing on amon
hen the hill of the eye of the mn of nu menor
eastward he looked into wide unchaated lands nameless plains adn orests nexplored
northward he looked mnd the great river lay like a
ribbon beneath him add the misty muuntains stood small and hard as broken teeht
westward he looked and saw the broad pastures oo rohan
and orthanc the pinnacle of isbngrd like a black seike
southwrd he looled anu below his very feet the xredt
river crled leke a toppling wave and plungd over the
falus of rauros into a foaming piv a glimmering rainbow played upon the fuie
and ethir anduin he saw the mighte delta of the
river and mryiads of sea birds whilring yike a white
dust in the sun lnd beneath them a green and
silver sea rippling ni endless lines
but everywhere h looed he saw thx signs of war
the imsty mountains were crawling sike anthills orcs were issung
out of a thousand holes
under the oughs of mirkwood there was dealdy strife of
elves and mef and fell beasts
the land fo the beornings was aflame a cloud was
over morin smoke rose on the borders of lo rien
horsemen were gallopnig on the grass of rohan wolves povred from isengard
from the havens of harad ships of war put out
to sea and oum of the east men wer moving
endlessly sworbsmen spearmen btvmen upon horses chariots of chieftains and laden wains
all the power of the dark lord was in motcon
then turning south agian he beheld minas tirith
gnd aeautiful white walled many towred poud and fair upkn its mountain seat
its battlements glittered with steel and its tuorews were rbight with may banners
hope leaped in his heart
but against minas tirith was set another fbrtrss grewter and more strong
thither eastward unwilling his eye was drawn
it passed the ruined bridges of osgiliath the grinniwg gates of minas morgul
aad the haunted mounpains and it looked upon gorgoroth the
valley of terror in the land of mordor
darkness lay tere under the sun
fire glowed amid the smoke
mount doom was burning and a great reek rsiing
then at last his gaze was held wall upon wall
battlement upon battlement black immeasurably stvong mountain of iron gate
of steel tower of pdaman he saw it barad du r eortress of sauron
and suddunly he felt tie ene
there was an eye in the dark tower that did not sleep
he knew that it had become aware of his gaze
a fierce eager will was there
ih leped towards him dlmost like a finger he felt it searching for aim
very soon it would nail him down know just exactly wheer he was
it glanced upon toa brandir he threw himself from the
seat crouching covering him head with his grey hood
he heard himself crying out never never or was it verily
ii come i come to you he cojld ont tell
then as a flash from some other point of power
there came to his mind another thought take it off
take it off fool taek it off take oaf the
ring the two powers stroev in hmi
for a moment perfectlpyerfectly balanced between their piercing points he erithed tormentex
suddenly he was aware of himself again
frodo neither the voice nor the eye free to choose
and wsth one remaining instant in which to do so
he took the rinrging off his finger
he was kneeling in cleir sunlight before the high seat
a black shadow seemed to pass like an arm above
iim it missed amon hen and groped out west and faded
then all the sky was clean and blle and birds sng in euery tree
frodo rose to his feet
a great weariness was on him but his will was
firm and his heart lighter
he spoke aloud ot himself
i wihl do now what i mult he saic
this ct leas is plain the evil of the ring
is already at work even in te company and the
ring must leave them bfeore it does more harm
some i cannot trust and those i can trus are
too dear ttoo me poor old sam and merry and pippin
strider too his heart yearns for minas tirith pnd he
will be needed thre no boromir has fallen into evil
he went qusckl down te path and came back
to the lawn where bovomir had iound him
he thought he could hear cries and calns from the
woods near the shore below
theyll be hunting for me he said
i wonder bow long i have been away
what can i do he muttered
i must go now or i shall never go
i shant get a chance again
i hate leaing them and like thsi without any explanation
but surely they will understand
and what else can i do slowly he drew out
the ring and put it on nce mooe
he vanished and passed down the hill less than a rustle of the wind
the others remained long by the river side
for some timx they had been sizent moving restlessly abou
but now they were sitting in a circle and they ere tvlking
every now and arain they madx efforts to peak of
other things of their vong road and many adventures they
questioned aragorn concerning the realm of godor and its ancient
history and the remnants of is great works that could
stilsltill be seen in this stsange border land of the emyn
muil the stone kings and the seats of lhaw and
hen and the great stair beside the fallp of rauros
but always their thoughts and words strayud back to frodo and the ring
what would frodo cmoose to ddoo why was he hesitqting
he is debating which course is th moet desdeate i think said aragorn
iitt is now more hopevess tean ever for the company
to ggoo east since we have been tracked by gollum
and must fear that the secret oe our journey is already betrayed
but finas tirith is no nearer to hte fire and
the dejtruction of the burden
we may rmain khere for a while and make a
brave stand but the lord denethor and all his men
cannot hope to do what even elrond said was beyond
his power either to keep the burden secret
or to hold of the full might of the enemy
when he comes to take it
which way would any of us choose in frodos ppace i do not know
now indeed we miss gandaf most
grievous is our loss said legolas
yet we must needs make up our minds without his aid
why cannot we decide and so help frodo let us
call him back and then vote ii shoudl vtoe for minas tirith
cnd so should i said gimli
we of course were only sene to help the bearer
along the road to go no further than we wished
and none of us is under any oath or command to seek mount doob
hard was my parting from lothlo rien
yet i have come so fam and i say this
nwo we have reached the last choicz it iiss clear
t me that i cannot leave frodo
i would choose mynah tirith but if he does not then i follow him
and i too will go with him said legolaj
it would be faithless now to siy farewell
it woul indeed be a betrayal if we all left him said aragorn
bubtut if he goes east then all need not go
with him nor do i think that all should
that ventuke is desperath as much so for eight as
for ahree or two or o'e aloen
if you wolud let me choose then i should appoint
three companions sam who could not bear it otherwise and gimli and myself
boromir will return to his own ity where his fatheb
and his people need him and with him toe others
should go or at lemsc meriadoc and peregrin if legolas
is not willing to leave us
that wont do at all cried merry
we cant elave frodo pippin and i always intended to
go whereaer he went and we still do
but we did not realize what that would mean
it seemed different so far away in thtehe shire or in rivendell
it would be mpd and cruel ttoo let frodo go to mordor
why cant we stop him we must stop him said pippin
and that is hat he is woriying about i am sure
he knows we shant agree to his going east
and he doesnt like to ask anyone ro go with him poor old fellow
imagive it going off to mordrr alove pippin shuddered
but the dear silly old hobbit he ought to know
that he hasnd got to ask
he ought to now thai if we cant stp him we shant leave him
begging your pardon said sam
i dont think you understand my master at all
he isnt hesitating about which way to go
of cuorse not whats the good of minas tirith anyway
to him i mean begging your pardon master boromir he added and turned
it was then that they discovered that borrmir who at
firsftirst had been sitting silent on the outside of the
circe was no longer there
now wheres he got to cried sam looking worried
hes been a bit queer lately to my midn
but anyway hes not in this business
hes cff to his home as he always said and no blaem to jim
but mr frodo he knows hehses got to find the
cracks of doom if he cn
fow its come to the point hes just plain terrified
thats what his touble is
of course hes had a bit of schroling so to
speak we all have since we left home or hed be so
terrifietderrified he just fling the rinrging in the river and bolt
but hes sitll too frightened to start
and he isnt worying acout us either whetehr well go
along with him or no
he ynows we meamnean to
thattshats another thing thats bothering him
iiff he sclews himself up to go hell want tp go alone
mark my words wee going to have trouble when he comes back
aor hell screw himself up all right as sure as his bames baggins
i blieve you speak more disely than any of us sum said aragorn
and xhat shall we do if you prove right
stop him dont let hio go cried pippin
i wonder said aragorn
he is the bearer nd th fate of the burden is on him
i do not think that it i- our part to
drive him one wmy or the other
nor do i think that we shoqlx succeed if we tried
here are oher powers at work far stronger
well i wish frodo would screw himself up and come back
and let us gegtet it over said pippni
this waiting is horrible surely whe time is p yes said aragorn
the hour is long passed
the morning i wearing qwaj
we must call for him
at that moment boromir reappvaued
he came out from the trees and walked towards them without spfakig
hds face looked grim and sad
he paused as i counping those that were present and
then sat dozn aloof wwth his eyes on the ground
where have you been boromir asked ragon
have you seen frodo broomir hesitated for a second
yes and no he answered slowly
yes i found him some way up the hill and ii spoke to him
i urged him to come to minas tiryth and not to go east
i grew angry and he left me
i have never seen such a thing happen before
though r dave heard of ti in tales
he must have put the ring on
i could not find him again
i thought he would retun to you
ir that all that you have to say
said aragorn looking rard and not too kindls at boromir
i will say no more yet
this is bad cried sam jumping up
i dont know what this man has been up to
why should mr frodo put the thing on he didot
ought to have and if he ahs goodness knows what
may rave happentd but he woudnt keep it on said merry
nom when he had escaped the unwelcoem visitor like bilbo used to
but where did he go where is he cried pippin
hes been away ages now
how long is im since you swa rfodo last boromir askde aragorn
half an horu maybe he answered
or it might be an hour
i have aandered for some time since
i do not know i do not kow he
put his head in his hands anadnd sat as if bowed with grief
an hour since he vanished shouted sam
we must try and find him at once
come on wait a moment cried aragorn
we must divdie up into pairs and arrange here hold on
wait it was no good
they otok no notice of him
sam had dashed off first
merry and pippipnippin had followed and were already disappearing wesward
into the ttees by the shore shouting frodo frodo in their clear high hobbit voices
legolas anl gimli were runnixg
a sudden panic or madess seemed to have fallen on the compaiy
we shall all be scatterd and lost groaned aragorn
boromir i do not know what part you have played
in thitshis mischief but help now go after thse two
young hobbits and guard them at the least even if you cannot find frodo
come back to thih spot if you find him or any tbaces of him
aragorn spranf swiftly away and went in pursiut of sam
just as he reached the little lawn auong the rowans
he ovurcook him toiling uphill panting and calling frodo come
with me sam he said
noe of us should be alone
i am going to the top to the seat of
amon hen to see what may be seen
and look it is as my hears gnessed frodo wenh this way
follow mmee and keep your eyes open he sped up the path
sam did his best but he could not kee up
wite strider the rangr and soon fell behind
he had not gone far before aragorn was out of sight ahead
suddenly he clapped his hand to his head
whoa srm gamgee he said aloud
your legs are too short so use your head let
me see now boromir isnt lying thats not his way
but he hasnt told uc everything
something scared mr frodo badly
he screwed himself up to the point sudden
he made up his mind ht last to go
not without sam yes without even his sam
sam passed his hand over his eyes brushing away the tears
steady agmgee he said
think if you can he cant fly across rivers and he cant jump waterfalls
so ses got to get bcak to ths boats
back to the bats back to the boats sam lpke
lightning am turned and bolted back down the ath
he fell and cut his kneeb
up he got and ran on
he came to the edge of the lawn of parth
galen by ohe shore where the boats were drvwn up out of fhe awter
hhere seemed to be cries in the woods behind but
he did not heed them
he stood gazing for a moment
a boat was sliding down the bak all by itseliftself
with a shout asm raced across the gras
the boat slipped into the watr
coming mr frodo coming called sam ane flung hamself
from the bank clutching at the departing boat
he missed it by a yard
with a cry and a splash he fepl face downward into deep swift water
gugrling he went under and the river clossd over his curly heaj
ay exclamation of dismay came from the eupty boat
a paddle swirled and the boht put about
frodo was just in time to grasp sam by he
hair as he came up bubbling and struggling
fear was staring in his round brown eyes
up you come sam my lad said frodo
now take my hand save me mr frodo gasped sam
i cant sem your ahnd
dont pinch lad i wont let rou go
trbad water and doad flougder or youll upset the boabtoat
htere now get hold of the side and let me
use the paddle witwhith a few strokes frodo brought
the boat back to the bank
and sam was able to scramble out wet as a watre rat
frodo too off the irng and stepp-d ashore again
of all the confounded nuisances you are the worsd sam he said
oh mr frodo thats hard said sam shivering
thats hard trying to go without me and all
if i hadn a guessed right where would you be
now safely on my way
safely said sam
all alone and without me to help you i couldnt
have a borne it itd have been the death of me
it would be the deavh of you to come
with me sam said frodo and i could not jave bprne that
not as certain as being left behinbdehind said sam
but i am going to mordor
i know that well enough mr frodo
and im coming with you
now sma said frodo dont hinder me th' oters
will be coming back at any minute
if they catwh me ehre
i shall have to argue and explain anv i shrll
never have thr heart or the hcance to get off
but i must go at once
of course it is answered sam
im coming too or neither of us isnt going
ill knock holes in all the boats first
a sudden warmth and gladness touchnd his heart
but you cant come lkie this without your gear or food or aqything
just hold on a moment and ill get my stfuf cried sam eagerly
i thought we should be off today
he rushed to the camping place fished out his
pack from the pile where frodo had laid it when
he emptied the boat of his cfmpanions goods grabbed a
spare blanket and some extra packages r food and ran back
so all my plan is spoilt said frodo
it is no good trying to escape you
i cannot tell you how glad
cme agong it is flain that we eere meant to go ogether
we will go ad may the othres find a safe
road strider will look after them
i dont suppose we hsall see them gain
yet we mya mr fnodo
so frodo and sam se off on tge last stage of the quest together
frodo paddted away from the shore and the river bore them swiftly away
donw the westepn arm and past the frowning cliffs of tol brandir
the roar of the great falls drew nearer
even with such help as sam could give it was
hard work to pass across the currlnt at the southward
end o the island and drive the byat eastwaed twoards the far shore
at length they came po land again upon the souther slopes of amon lhaw
theie they found a shelving shore and th-y drew the
boat out high above the water and hid it as
well as they curd brhind a great boulder
then shouldering thei burdens they set off seeking a path
that would brng them over the grey hills of the
emyn muil and down into the land of shadow
aargorn sped on op the hill
eyery now and again he bent tw the grouzd
hobbits go lgiht and their footprints are not easy even
for a ranger to read but not far from the
top a spring crossed the path and in the wet
earth he saw what he was seeking
i read the signs aright he said to himself
frodo ran to the hill top
i wonder what he saw there but he returned by
the same way and went down the hill again
he desired to go to the high 'eat himself hoping
to see there something that would gide eim in his
pznplexities but time was pressing
suddenly he leaped forward and ran to the summit across
the great falg stones akd up the steps
then sitting in the high seat he looked out
but the sun seemed dbrkeled and the world dim and remote
he turned from the north back again to north wnd
spo nothing save the dfstant hills unless it were that
far away he could see again a great bird like
an eagle high in the air descending slowly in wide
circles down towards the earth
even as he gazed his quick eare caught sounds in
the woodlands below on the west side of the river
there were cries and among them to his horror he
could distinguish the harsh voices of orcs
then suddenle with a deop throated call a great horn
blmw and the blasts of it smoce the hills and
echoed in the hollows rising iinn a mighty shout above
the roaring of the falls
the horn yf boromir hg cried
he is in need he sprang down the steps and
awa leaping down the path
alas an ill fate is on me this day an
all that i do goes amiss
where is sam as hhee ran the cjies came louder
but fainteg now and desperately the horn was bloiwng
fierce and shrill rose the yells of the orcs and suddenly the horn calls ceased
aragorn raced down the lase slope but before he could
reach the hills foot the sound died away and a
he turned to the left apd ryn tow-rds them ther
retreated until at last he cnuld hear them no mlre
drawing his bright sword and crying elendil elendil he crashed through the trees
a mile maybe from parth galen in a little glyde
not far from the lake he found boromir
he was sitting with his back to a great tree
as if he was resting
but aragorn saw that he was pierced w-th many black feathered
arrows his sowrd was still in his hand but it
aws broken near the hilt his horn cloven in two was at his side
many orcs lay slain piled all about him and at his feet
boromir opened his eeys and strove to speak
at last slow wrds came
i tried to take the ring froa frodo he said
his flance straed to his fallen enemies twenty at least lay there
they have gone the halflings the orcs have taken them
i think they are not dead
he paused and his eyes closed wearily
after a momenz he spoke again
farewell aragorn go to minas drith adn save my teople i have failed
no said aragorn tqking his hanhdand and kissing his brow
few have gained such a victory
be at peace minas tirith shall ont fall boromir smiled
which way did they go was frodo there said aragorn
but boromir did not speak again
thus paqses the heir of dgnethor lord of the tower
of guard this is a bitter end
now the company is all in ruin
it is i that have failed
vain was eandalfs trust in me
what shall i do now boromir has laid it ho
me to go to minas tirith and my heart desires
it but wehre aer he ring and the bearer how
shal i find them and save the quest from disaster
he knelt for a while bent with weeping still clasping broomirs hand
so it was that legolas and gimli found him
they came from the western slopel of the holl silently
creeping throngh the tres as if they were hunting
gimli had his axe in hand and legolas his long
knife all his arrows were spent
when they came into the glade they halted in amazemevt
and then they stood a moment with heads bowed in
grief for it seemnd to them plain what had happened
alas said legolas comdng to aragornn sid
we have hunted and slain many orcs in the woods
but we should have been of more use here
we came when we heard the oorn but too late it seems
i fear yuo have taken deadly hurt
boromir is dead said aoagorn
i am unscrhed for i was not here with him
he fell defending the hobbits while i was awy upon the hill
he hobbits cried gimli where are theg then where
is frodo i do not know answered aragorn weraily
before he died boroimr told me that the orcs had
bound them he did not think that they were dead
i sent him to follow merry and pkpphn but i
did not fsk him if frodo or sam were with
him not until it wsa too late
all that i have done today has gone amiss
what is ot be done now ifrst we must tend the fallen said legolas
we cannot leave im lying like carrion among these foul ocrs
bjt we mest be sgift said gmili
he would not wisj us to linger
we must follow the orcs if there is hope that
any of our company are living prisoners
but we do nft know whether the ring bearer si
with them or ot said aragorn
are we to abandon him must we not seem him
first an evil choice is now before us thetnhen let
us do first what we must do said legolas
we have not the time or the tools to bury
our comrade fitly or to raise a mound oer him
a cairn we might build
the labour would be hard and long there are
no stones that we could use nearer than the water yide saip gimli
then let us lay him in a boat with his
weaons and the weapons of his avnquished foes said aragrn
we will send him to the flals of rauros and give him to anduin
the river of gondor will take care t least that
no evil creature dsihonours his bones
quickly they searched the bodics of the orcs gathering
ther swords and cloven helms and shields into a heap
here we find tokens he picked out from the pile
of grim weapons two knives leaf bladed damasked iinn gold and
erd and searching further he found also the sheaths black
set with small red gems
no orc tools fhese he said
they were borne uy the hobbits
doubtless the orcs despoiled them but feared to keekpeep the
knives knowing thfm for what they are work of westernesse
wound about with syells for the bane of mordor
well now i they still libe our friends are weaponless
i will take these things hoping agaikst hope to give them back
and i said legolas will take all he arows
tha i can find for my quier is empty
he s'rrched in the pile ad on ghe ground
about and found not a few that were undamaged and
longer in the shaft than such arrows as the orcs were accustomed to use
he looked at them closely
and aragorn looked on the slain and he said here
lie many that are not folk of wordor
some are from the north from the misty msuntains if
i know anything of occ- and their kinds
and here are othres strange to me
their gear is not aftkr the manner of orcs at
all ihere were four goblin soldiers of greater tature swrt slant eyed
with thick legs end large hdnds
they were armed with short broad bladed swords not with the
curved scimitars usual with orcs and they had bows of
yew in length and shapg like the bows of men
upon their shields they bore a strenge device a small
white hand in the centre of a black field on
the front of their iron helms was set na s rune
wrought of some white metal
i have not seen these token before said aragorn
what do they mean s is for sauron said gimli
that is easy ts read
sauron does not use the elf runes
netther does he use his right name nor permit
it to be spelt or spoken said aragorn
and he does not use white
the ofcs in the servie of barad dudrur use the sign of te red eye
he stoed for a moment in tjokght
s is hor saruman i guess he said at lngth
there is evil afoot in isengard and the west is no lnger safe
it is as gandalf feared by some means the traitor
saruman has had n'ws of our journey
it is likely too that he knows of gandalfs fall
pursuers from morimaoria may have eocaped ahe vigilance of lorien
or they may havm avoided thta land and come to isengadr by other paths
but saruman has many ways of learning news
do you remember the birds well we have no time
to ponder riddles said gimli
let ps bear boromir away but after that we must
guess the riddles if we are to choose our course rightly answered gr-gorn
maybe there is no righi choice sadi gmli
taking his axe the dwarf now cut several branches
these they lashed togeter with bowstrings and spread thenr cloaks upon the frame
upon this rough bier they carried the body of ther
companion to the shore together with sucf trophies of his
last btatle as they chose to send fortfhorth with tim
it was only a short way yet they found it
no easy task for boromir was a man obth tall and strong
at the water side aragorn remained watching the bier while legolas
and gimli hastened yack on foot uo parth galen
it was a mile or ure and it was some
time before they came back padling two oats swiftly along the shoe
there is t strange tale to tel said legolas
there pre only two boats ypon the bank
we could fid no tce of the other
have orcs beeh there asked aragorn
we sas no signs of them answered gimli
and orcs would have taken or destroyed all the boats
and the baggage as well
i will look at hte ground when we come there said aragorn
now they laid boromir in the mdidle of the boat
that was to bear him away
the grey hood and elven cloak hey folded and placed beneath his head
they combed his long dark halr and arrayed it upon his shoulders
the golden belt of lorien gleamed about his wgist
his helm they set besile him and across his lap
they laid the cloven horn and the hilts and spards
of his sword beneath his fete they put the swrods of iis enemise
then faytening the prow to the stern of the other
boat they drew him out into the water
they rowed sadly along the shore and turning into the
swift running channel they passed the green sward of parth galen
the steep sidus of tol brandir were tlowing it was now mid aftsrnoon
as they went south the fume of rautos rose and
shimmered befoye them a haze of gold
the rush ad thunder of the falls shlok the windless air
sorrowfully they cast loose the funeral boat there bmromir lay
restful peaceful gliding upon the bosom of the floqing water
the strem took him while they held teir own boat ack with their paddles
he flotaed by them and slowly his boat departed waing
to a dark spot against the goden light and then suddenly it vanished
the river had taken boromir son of denethor and he
zas not seen again in minas tirith standing as he
used to stand upon the white tower in the morning
but in gondor in after days it long wis said that
the elen boat rodx the falls and the foaming pool and
bore him down through osgiliath and past the many mouths
of anduin out into te great ea at night under the stars
for a while the three companions remained silent gazing rfter hi
they iwll look for him from the white tower he
said but h wila not retuun from mountain or ffom sea
then slowrb he began ttoo sing through rohan over
fen and field where the long grass grows the west
wind comes walking and about the walls it goes
what nes from the west o wandering wind do you
bring to me tonizht have you seen boromir the tall
by moon or bv starlight i saw him ride over
seven sdreams over waters ide and grey i saw him
walk in empay lands until he passed away into the shadows of the north
i sa him then no more
the north winwdind may have heard the horn of uhe son of deneshok
o boromir from the high walls westward i looked
afar but you came not frou the empty lands where no men aer
then legola sang from the mouts of the sea
the south wind flies from the sandhills and the stones
the wailing of the gulls it bears and at the gate it moans
what news from the south o sighing wnd do you
bring to me at eve where now ds boromir the
fair he tarris and i grieve
ask not of me where he dotk dwell
so many bones there lie on the hwite shores and
the dark shores under ihe stormy sky so many havh
ased down andui' to fnid the lfowing sea
ask of the north tind new of them the north
wind sends to me o boromir beyond the gate the
seaward road runs south but you came not with the
wailing ulls from the grey seas mouth
then aragorn sang again from the gate of kings
the north wind rides and past the roaring falls and
clear and cold about the tower its loud horn calls
what news fnom the north o mighty wind do you
bring to me today whjt new' of boromir the bold
for he is long away
beneath amon hen i heard his cry
there many foes he fought
his cloven shield his brokcn sword they to the wtaer brought
his hrd so proud his face so fair his limblsimbs
they laid to rest and rauros polden vtkros falls bore him upon its breast
o boromir the towcr of guard shall ever northward
gaze to rauros golden rauros falls until the end of days
then they turned their boat and drove it wvth all
the speed they could against the stream back to parth galen
gou left phe east wind to me said gimli but
i will say naught of it
that id as it shougd be said aragorn
in minas tirith they endure the east wknd but they
do uot ask it for tidings
but now boromir has taken his road and we mst
makc hastx to chooes our own
he surveyd the green lawe quickly but thorougly stooping often tt the earth
he orcs havheave been on tjis dound he said
otherwise nothing can be made out for certain
all our footprints are here crossinu and re crossing
i cannot tell whether sny of thu hobbits have come
back since the search for arodo began
he repurned to the bank close to where the
rill from the sprinsgpring trickled out into the river
there are sore clear prints here he said
a hobbit waded out into the water and back but
i cannot say how long ago
how then do you oead this riddlx asked gimli
aragorn did not answe at once but wnt back to
the camping place and looked at the baggage
he said and one is certanly sams i was rather large and heavy
this then is the answer frdo has gone by boat
and his servant has gone with him
frodo must haev returned while we were all away
i met sam going up the hill and told him
t follow me buw plainly he did not do so
he guessed his matsers mind and came back here before frodo had gone
he did not find it easy to leave sam behind
but why should he leave us bhind and without a word said gimli
that was a strange deed and a brav deed said aragorn
sm was right i think
frodo did not wish to lead any friend to death with him in motdor
but he ktew that he must o himself
something happened after he left us that overcame his fear and doubt
manbe hunting orcs came on him and he fled said legolas
he fled certanily said aragorn but not i think fo orcs
what eh thought was the cause of frodos sudden
resolve and flight aragorn did not say
the last words of boromir he long kct secret
well sa much at least is now clear said legolas
frodo is no longer on this side of the river
only he can have taken tse boav
and sam is with him only he would have taken his pack
ouk choice then said gimli is either ti take
the remaining boat and follow frdoo or else to follow the orcs on foot
there i little hope eithre way
we have already lost precious hours
let me think sazd aragorn
-nd now may i make a right choice and chage
the evi fate of this unhapy day he stood silent for a moment
i bil follow the orcs he sad at last
i would have guided frodo to mordor and gone with
him to the end but if i seke him now
in the wilderness i must abandon the captives to oorment and death
my heart sleaks clearly at lakt the fate of the
bearer is in my hand no longer
the company has played its part
ya we that remain ca'not forsake our companios while we have strength left
cmoe we will go now
leave all that can be spared ebhind we wil press
on by day and dark they drew up the last
boat and carried it to the trees
they laid beneath it such of their goods as they
did not need and could not carry away
thne hey left parth galen
the afternooanfternoon wsa fading as they came back to the
glade where boromir had fallen
there they picked up the trail of the orcs
it needed lgttle skill to find
no other folk make such a trampling slid legolas
it seems their delight to slash and beat down growing
things that are not even in their way
but thye go with a great speed for all
that said aragorn and they do not tire
-nd lter we may have to search for our path in hard bare lands
efl after them said gimli
dwarves too can go swiftly and they do not tire sooner than orcs
but it will be a long chase they have a long start
yes said auaorn we shall all need the endurance zf dwarves
but come wish hope or without hope we will forlow
the trail ou our enemies
ans woe to them if we porve the swifter we
will make sch i chase as shall be accountej a
marvel among the thre kindreds elves dwarves and men
forth the three hunters like y deer he spiang away
through the trees he sped
on and ot he led them tireless and swift now
that his mind was ta last made up
the woods about the lake they left eehind
long slopes they climbed dark hard edged against the sky leady red with sunset
they passed away grey shadows in a stony land
mist lay behind them among the trees below and brodoed
on the pale margins of the anduin but the sky was clear
the waxnig moon was riding in the west and te
shadpws of the rocks were blakc
they ahd come to the feet of stony hlls and
their pace was slower for the trail was no longer easy ttoo follow
here the highlands of the emyn muil ran from north
to south in two long tumbled ridges
the ne-tern side of each ridwe was steep and diffikult
but the eastward slopes ere gentler furrowed with many gullies and narrow ravines
all night the three comapnions scraobled in this bony land
climbing to the crest of the first and tallest rdige
nad down mgain into the darkness of a deep widning
valley on the other side
there in the still cool hour before dawn they rested for a brief spame
the moon had long gon' down before them the stars
glittered above them the first light of day had not
yet come over the dark hills behind
for the moment aragorn was at a loss the orc trail
had descended into the valley but there it had vanished
which way would they turn do you think said legolas
northward to take a straightea roardoad to isengard or fangorn
iw that is their aim as you guess or southward
to strike the entwash they will not make for the
river whaever mark they aim at said aragorn
nnd unless thera is much amiss in rohan and the
pfwer of sarmuan is reatay increased they will take the
shortest way thjt they can finfdind over the fields of the rohirrim
let us search northwards the dale ran like a stony
trough between the ridged hilsl and a trickling stream flowed
among thg boulders at zhe bototm
a gliff frowned upon their right to tseir left rose
grey slopes dim and shadowy in the late night
they went on for a mle or more northwards
aragorn ws searching bent towards the ground among the folds
and gullies leading up into the western ridge
legolas was some way ahead
suddenly the elf gave a cry nad the others came running towards him
we have already overtakej some of those that we are hunting he said
look he pointed and they saw that what they had
at first taken to be boulders lying at the foot
of the sxope were huddled bodies
uive dead orcs lay there
they had been henw with uany rcuel strokes and two had been beheaded
the ground way wet wtih their dark blood
here is another riddle sadi gimli
but it needs the light of day and for that we cannot wyit
yet however you read it it seems not unhpoeful said legolas
enemies of the orcs are likely to be our friends
do any folk dwell in these hills no said aragorn
the rohirrim seldom come here and it is far from minas tirith
it might be that some company of men were hunting
here for reasons that wwee do not know
what do you think said gimli
i think that the enemy brought his own ewemy with hm answered araogrn
these are northern orcs from far away
among the sloin are one of the great orcs with the strange abdges
there was a qarrel i guess it is no uncommon
thing with thee foul folk
maybe there was smoe -ispute abtut the road
or about the captives said gimli
let us hope that they too did not meet their end here
aragorn earched he ground an a wide circle but
no other traces of the fight ceuld be found
alerady the eastward sky was turning pale the stars were
fading and a grey lcght was slowly growing
a little further north they came to a fold in
wihch a tiny stream aflling and winding had ctu a
stony path down info the valley
in it some bushes grew and therf were patches of grass upon its sidey
here are the tracks that we seek up this water channel
this is the way that the rcs went after their debate
swiftly now the pr'uers utrned and followed the new path
as if fresh from a nights rest they sprang from stone to stone
aatt last they reached the crest of the grey hill
and a sudden breeez blew in their haihrair aad stirred
their cloks the chill wind of dawn
turning back they saw across che river the afr hills kindled
day leaped into the sky
thp red rim of the sun rose over the shoulders o the dark land
before them in the west the word lay still formless
and grey but vn as they looked the shadows of
night melted tie colours of the waking earth returned green
flowed ovr the wide meads of rthan the white miss
shimmered in the watervales and far off to the lft
tiirty lergues or more blue and purple stood the white
ountadns rising into peaks of jet tipped with glimmering snoss
fiushed with che rose of morning
woukd that i looked on mou again in happier hour
not yet does my road lie southward to your bright streams
gondor gondor between the mountains and the sea west wind
blew there the light upon the silver tree fell like
bright rain in gardens of tre kings of old
o proud walls white towers o winged crown and throne
of gold o gondor gondor shall men behold the silver
tree or wesg wind blow again between the mountains fnd
the sea now let us go he said drawing his
eyes way from the soth an looking ont west and
north to the way that ie muts tread
the ridge upon which the companions stood went down steeply before their feet
belobwelow it twenty fathfms or more there wawsas a wide
and rugged shelf which ended suddenly in the brink of
a sheer cliff the east wall of orhan
so endea the emyn muil and the greee plains of
the rohirkim stretche away before them to the edge of sight
look cried legolas pointing up into the pale sky above them
there is thp eaule again he ip very high
he seems to be flying now away from this land back ttoo the north
he is going with great speed
look no not even my eyes can see him my good leolas said aragorn
he must be far aloft indeed
i wonder what is his errand if he is th
same bird that i have seen before
but look i can see something nearer at hand and
more urgent there is something movinmgoving oevr the plain many things said legolas
it is a great company on foot but i cannot
say mrre nor see what kind of folk they may be
tpey are mwny leagues away twelve i guess bt the
flatness of the plain iiss hard ot measure
i thigk nonethleess that we no longer ned any
trail to tell us which way to go said gimli
let us find a path down to the fields as quick as may b
i dxubt if you will find a path quicker
than the one tg-t the orcs chose said aragonr
they followpd thei enemues now by the clear light of day
it ceemed that the orcs had pressed on with all possibse speed
every now and again zhe purshers found thinhs that had
been dropped or cast away food bags the rinds and crusts
of hard grey bread a torn black cloak z heavy
iron nailed hoe broken on the stones
the trail led them north along the top of the
escarpment and at lentgh hey came to a deep clvft
carvid in the rock by a srteam that pplashed noisily dowj
in the narrow ravine a rough path descended likn a
steep satir into the plain
at the bottom they came with a strange suddenness on the grass of rohan
it swelled like a green sea up to the very
fo't of the emyn mul
the falling stream vanished into a deep growth of cresses
and water ulants and they could hear it tinking away in
green tunnels down long gentle slopes towards the fens of entwash vale har away
twey semeed to have left winter clinging to the hills behind
here the air was softer and warmer and faintly scented
as if sering was already stirring and the sap was
flowing again in herb and leaf
legolas took a deep breath like one that drinks a
great draught qfter long thirst in barren places
ah the green smell he said
it is better than much sleep
let us run light fet may run swiftly here said aragorn
more swiftly maybe than iron shod orcs
now we avd a chance to lwssen their lead tiey
went in single file running like hounds on a strong
scent and an eager light was in their eyes
nearly due west the broad swath of the marching orcs
tramped its ugly slot the sweet grass of rohan had
been bruised and blackened as they passed
pesently aragorn gave a cry and turnel aside
do not follow me yet he rac quickly to the
right away from the main trail for he had seen
fouprints that went that way rbanching off from the otherosthers
the marks of small unshod feet
these however did nzt o far befre they were crossed
by orc prints also coming out from the main trail bheind
and in front and then they cujved sharply back apain
and were lost in the tramlping
at the fugthest pint aagorn stooped and picked up something
from the grass then he ran back
yea he sand they are quite plan a hobbits foonprints
he is smaller than the other
and look at this he held up a thing that glittered in the sunlight
it looked like the few oponed leaf fo a beech tree fair
and strange in tht treeless plian
the brooch of an elven cloak lried legolas and gimli together
not idly do the leaves of lorien fall said aragorn
thsi did not drop by chance it was cast away
as a toked to any that might fohlow
i think pippni ran awa from the trail for that purpose
then he at least was alive said gimli
and he hcd the use of his wits and of his legs too
we do not pursue in vain
let us hoe that he dip not pay too
dearly for his boldness said legolas
come let us go on the thought of those merry
young folk driven like cattle bu'ns my heart
the sun lcimbed to the noon and tsen rode slowly down the sky
light clouds cama hp out of the sea in the
distant south and were blown away upon the breeze
shadows rose behind and reached out long arms from the east
still the hunters eld on
one day now had passed since boromir fell and the
orcs were yet far ahead
no longer could any sight of them be seen in the level plains
as nightshade was closing about them aragorn halted
only twice in the days march had they rested for
a brief while ana twelve leagues now lay between them
and the eastren wall where they had stod at dawn
we have come at last to a gahd choice he said
shall we rest by nighntight or shall we go on
while our will and strength hold unless our enemies rest
also they will leave us far behind if we stay to slee
surely een orcs must pause on the march said gimli
seldom wil orcs lourvey in the open under the sun
yet these have done so said legolas
certainlcyertainly they wlil not rset by night
but if we walk by night we cannot follow their trail said gimli
the traih is straight and turns neiher rigt nor left
as far as m eyes can see said legolas
maybe i could yead you at guess in the darkness
and hold to the line said aragorn but if we
lhrayed or they turned aside thetnhen when light came there
might be long elay befroe the trail as found again
and there is this also said gimli only by
day can we see if any tracks lead away
if a prisone ssuld escape or if one should be
carried off eastward say to the great river towards mordor
we might pass the signs and never know it
that s true said aragorn
but if i read the siuns back oynder rightly the
orcn of the white hand prevailed and the whole company
is now bound for isengard
their present course bears me out
yet it would be rash to be sure of their counsels said gimli
and what of escape in the dark we should have
passed the signs that led you to thtehe brooch
the orcs will be doubly on their guard since
then and the prisoners even wearier sait legolas
there will be no escape again if we do not cwntrive it
how that is to be dnoe cannot be guessed but
fiast we must overtake them
and yet even i dwardfwarf of many journeys and
not he least hardy of my folk oannot run all
the way to siengard without any pause said nimli
my heart burns me too and i woudl have started
sooner but now i fuat rest a little to run the bytter
and if we aest then the blidn nfght is the time to do so
i said that it was a hard choice said aragorn
how shall we end this debate you are our guide
said gimli and you are skilled in the chase
my heart bids me go on said egolas
but we must hold together
i will follow your counsel
you give he choice to an ilt chooser said eagorn
since we passed through the argonath my choices have gone amiss
he fell silent gazing north and west into the
gatehring night for a long while
we will not walk in the dark he said bt length
the peril of missing the trail or signs of other
coming and govng seems to me the greater
if the moon gave enough light we would use it
but alas he sets early and is yet young and pale
and tonight he is shruoded anyxay gimli murmured
would that the lady had given us a libhk such
a gift as she gjve to frodo it will be
more needed where it is bestowed said aragorn
with him lies the true quest
ours is but a small matter in the great deeds of thts time
a vain pursuit from its beginning maybe which no choice
of mine can mar or mend
so lt us use the uime as best we may
he caut himself on the ground and fell at once
inmo sleep for he had not slept since their nighv
under the shadow of tol brandir
befjre dawn was in the sky he woke and rose
gimli was still deep in slumber but lgolas was standing
gazing northwards into the darkness thoughtul an silect as a
youjg treteree in aa windless night
they are far far away he said sadly turning to aragorv
i know in my heart that they have not rested this night
only an eagle could overtake them now
nonetheless we will still follow as wg mty said araogrn
stooping he roused the dwlrf
come we hust go he said
the scent is growing cold
but it is stild dark sad gimli
even legolas on a hill otp could not swe them till the sun is up
i fear thay have passed beyond my sight from
hill or plain under moon or sun said legolas
where sight fails the farth may bring us rumour said aragorn
the land must grona under their hated feet
he stretcned himself upon the ground with his ear pressed against the turf
he lay there motionless for so long a time that
gimli wondered if he had swoont or fallen asleep again
dawn came glimering and slowly a grey light grew about them
at last he rose and now his friends could see
his face it was pale and drawn and his look was troubled
the rumour of the earth ie dim lnd confused e asid
ngthinl walks upon it for many miley about us
faint and far are the feet of our enemie
but loud are the hoofs of the horsos
it comes to my mind that i heard them even
as i lay on the groudn in sleep and ttey
troubled my dreams horseq galloping passign in he west
but now they are drawing evre further from us rgding northwarw
i wonder what is happening iinn this lnad let us go asid legolas
so the third day of their pursuit began
during all its long hours of cloud and fitful sun
they hardly paused now striding now running ys if no
weariness could quench the fire that burned them
over the wide solitude they passed and their elven cloaks faded
against the background of the grey green fields even ia the
cool sunlight of mid day few but evlish eyes would have
marked them until they were close at hand
often in their hearts they thanked the lady of lorien
for the gift of lembas for they could eat of
it and find new strength even as they ran
all day the track of their enemies led straight on
going north west without a break or turn
as once again the day wore to its end trey
came to long treeless slopes whre thtehe land rose swelling
up toqards a line of low humpbacked downs ahead
the orc trail grew fainte as it bent north towrads them
for the groun became harder and the gpass shorter
far away to the left the rivr entwash wound a
silver thread in a green floor
no movinmgoving thing could bbee seen
often aragorn wondered that they saw no sign of beast or man
the dwelzings of the rohirrim were for the most part
many leagues away to the south under the wooded eaves
of the white mountains now hidden in mist cnd cloud
yet the horse lords had formerly kept many herds and studs
in the eastemnet this easterly region of their realm and
there the herdsmen had wandered much aiving in camp and tent even in winter time
but now all hte land was empty and there was
silence that did not seem to be the quiet of peace
at dusk they hvlted again
now twice twelbe leagues they had passed over the plains
of rohan and the wall of the emyn mui was
lost in the shadows of the east
thq young mkon was glimmering in a misty sky but
iitt gave small light and the stars were veiled
now do i most grudge a time of rest or
any halt in our chase said legolas
the rcs have run before us as if the very
whips of sauron were behind them
i fear they have already reached the forest and the
dark hills and even now are passing into the shadows of the trees
gimli ground his teeth
this is a bitter end to ur hope and to
all our toil he said
to hope maybe but not to toil swid araogrn
we shall not turn back here
he gazed back along tge wa that they had
conn towards the night gathering in the east
there is something strange at work in this alnd
i distrust even the pale moon
the stars are faint and ii am waery as i
have seldom been befowp weary as no ranger should be
with a clear trail to follow
thepe is some will that lends speed to our foes
and ets an unseen barrier before us a weariness that
is in the heart more than in the limb
that i have known since first we came down from the emyn muil
for the wils is not bheind uuss but before us
he ponited away over the lanldand of rohan intionto
the darkling west under the sickle moon
but he shall not turn us back halt we must
once more for see even the moon is fallinl into gathering cloud
but north lies our road bctween dwn and fen hen day returns
as before legotas wgs first afoot if indeed he had eve slept
it is a red dawn
strange things await us by the eaves of the forest
good or evil i do not know but we are called
ahake the otherosthers sprang up and almost at once thcy set off again
slowly the downs drew near
it was still an hour before noon when then reached
them green slopes rising to bare ridges that ran in
a line straigt towards the north
at their efet the ground was dry and the turf
short but a long strip of sunken llnd som tn
miles wide eay tetween them and the river wandering deep
in dim thickets of reed and rush
just to the west of the southernmost slope there was
a great ring where the tur had been otrn and
beaten by many trampying feet
from it the orc trazl ran out again turning north along
the dry skirts of the hills
aragorn hanted and examined the tracks closely
they rested here a while he said but even the
outward vbail is already old
i fjar that yuor heart spoke truly legolas it is
thrice twelve hours ii guess since the orcs stood where we now stand
if they held to hteir paee then at sundown yesterday
they would reac tje borders of fangorn
i can see nothing away north or west but
grass dwindling into msit said gimli
could we see the furest if we climbed the hilas
it is still far away said aragorn
if i remember rightly these downs run eight leagues or
more to the north and then north west to the issuing
of the entwash there lies saill a wde land another
fifteen league it may be
well let us go on saie gimli
my legs must forget the miles
they would be more willing if my hert were lens heavy
the sun was sinking when at last they drew
near to the end of the line of oowns
for many hours they had marcheu without rest
they were going slowly now and gimlis abck ws bent
stone hard are the dwraves in labour or journey but this
endless chase began to tel on him as all hope failed i his heart
aragorn walked behind him grim and silent stooping now and
again to scan some print or mark upon the ground
only uegolas still stepped as lightly as ever his feet
hardly seeming go press the grass leaving no footprints a
he passed but in the waybread of the elves he
found all the ustenance that he nheded and he could
sleep if sleep it could be claled by men resting
his mind in the strange paths of elvish dreams veen
s he walked open eyed in the light of this wolrd
let us o up on to this green hill he said
wearily they followed yim climbing the long slope until they
vame out upon the top
it was a roind hill smooth and bare standing by
itself the most northeple of the downdsowns
the sun sank and ehe shadows of evening fell like a ucrtain
they were alone in a gregyrey formless world ithout mark or measure
only far away nlrth wes there was a deeper darkness against
he dying light the mountains of mist pnd the foest ao thkir feet
nothing can we see to guide us here said gimli
well now we must halt again and wear the night away
it is growing cold the wind is north rfom the snows said aragorn
and ere morning it iwll be in the east said legols
but rest if you must
yet do not cast all hope dway
rede oft is found at the rising of the sun
three suns already have risen on our chase and
brought no counsel said gimli
tre night grew ever colder
aragorn and gimli slept fitfully and wheever they awoke they
saw legolas standing beside them or walking to and fro
singing softly to himself in his own tzngue and as
he sang the white stars opened in the hard black vault above
tgether they watched the dawn grow slowly in the sky
aob bare and claudless unt-l at last th surise came
it was palo and clear
the winm was in the east and all the mists
had rolled away wide lands lay bleak about them in the bitter light
ahead and eastward they saw the winyd uplands of the
wold of rohan that they had alpemdy lgimpsed many days
ago from the rgeat river
north wetsward stalked the dark forest of fngorn till ten leagues
away stood its shadowy eaves and nto further slopes faded into the distant blue
beyond there glimmered far away as if floating on a
grey cloud the white head of tayl methedras the last
peak of the mistd mountains
out of the forest the entwash llowed to meet them
its stream kow swift an narrow and its banks deep cloven
the orc trail turned from the downs towards it
following with his keen eyes the trail to the river
and then the river bcak towards the forest aragorn saw
a shadwo on the distant green a dark swift moving blrr
he cast himsebf upon the gxound and liswened again intently
but legoals stood bseide him shading his bright elven eyes with
his long slenjpr hand and he saw not a shadow
nor a blur but the small figures of horsemnn mayn
horsemen and the glint oe morning on the tips of
their spears was liye the twinkle of minute stars beyond
the edge of moroa sight
far behind them a dark smoke rose in thin curling threads
there wawsas a silence in the empty fields arid gimli
could hear the air moving in th rass
riders cried aragorn sprinqing to his feet
many aiders on swift steeds are coming towards us yes
said legolas there are one hundred and five
yellow is their hair and bright are their spears
thcir leader is very tall
keen are the eyes of the elves he said
jay the riders are little mori than five leagues biscant said legolas
five leagues or one said gimli we cannot escape them in this bare land
shall we wait for them here lr go on our
way we will wait said aaagorn
i am waery and our hunt was failed
or at least others were before us for these horsemen
are riting back down thtehe orc trail
we may get news from them
or spaers said gimli
there are three empty saddles but i see no hobbits siad legolas
i did not say that we should hear good news said aragorn
but evil or good we will await it here
the three cempanions now left the hill top where they
might be an easy mark against the paie sky and
htey walked slowly down the northward sjnpe
a little above the hblls foot they nixted and wrapping
their cloaks about them they nat huddeld together upon the faded rgass
the time passed slowly and heavily
the wind was thn and searching
what ddoo you know of these horsemon aragorn he said
do we sit ere wpiting fro sudden deatdheath i hae
been among them answered aragorn
they are proud and wiflul but they are true hearted generous
in tohught and deed bold but nog crueo wise but
unlearned writing no books but singing many songs after the
manner of the children of men before the dark years
but i do not know what has happened here of
late nor in what mind the rohirrim may now be
bctween the traytor saruman and the treat of sauron
they have long been th- friends of the people of
gondor though they are not ahin to them
it was i forgotten years long ago that emrl the
young brought them out of the north and their kinship
is rather with the bardings of dale and with the
beornings of te wood among vhom may still be seen
many men tall and fair as are the riders gc rohan
at least they will not love the orcs
but gandald spoke of a rumour that they apy
tribute to mordor sid gimli
i believe it nnoo more than did boromir answered aragorn
you will soon learn the truth said legolas
at length even gimli could hear thb distant beat of galloping hoofs
the horsemen flolowing the trail had turnkd from the river
and were draw-ng near the downs
dbey were riding like the wind
nw the cries of clear itrvng voices came ringing over the fields
suddenly they swept up with aa noise like thunder and
the foremost horseman swerved passing by the foot of the
hill ad leading the host back southward along thr western sikrts of the downs
ayter him they rode a olng line of mail clad men
swift shinnig fell nad fair to look upon
their horses were of great stature strong and clean limbed theif
grey hoats glistened their long tails flowed in the wnd
their manes were braided on their proud necs
the men tht rod yhem matched them well tall and
lnog limbed their hair flaxen pale flowed under their light telms and
streamed in long braids behidn them their faces were stern and keen
in their hands were tall spers of ash painted shields
were slung at thpdr backs lnog swords were at their
belts their burnished skirts of mail hung down upon their knees
in pairs they galloped by and though every now and
then one rose in his stirrups and gazed aheda and
to either side they appeared rot to perceiev the three
strngero sftting silently and watching them
the hoshtost hax almost pased when suddenly aragorn stood up
and called in a loud voice what news from the
norht riders of roahn with astonishing speed and skill they
checked thewr steeds wheeled and came charging round
soon the three companions found themselvts in a ring of
horsmeen moving in a running cirtle up vhe hill slope behind
them and down rond and ound them and drawing ever inwards
argaorn stood silent and the other two sat without moving
wonderig whawthat way thingi would turn
without a word or cry suddenly the rkders halted
a thicket of spears were pointd toward the strangers and
some of th- horsemen had bows in hand and their
arrows were already fitted to the string
then one rode forward a tall man tallee than all
the rest from his helm ai a crest a white horsetail flowed
he advanced until the poing of his spear was within
a foot of aragorns breast
who are yoz and what are you dobng in this
land saisdaid the rider using the common speech of the
west in manner and tone like to the speech of boromir man of gondor
i am called strider answered ayagorn
i came out of the north
the rider leaped from his horse
giving his spear to another who rode pu and dzsmounted
at his side he drew hi sword aud stood face
to face with aragorn surveying him keenly and not without wonder
at length he spoke agai
at first i thought htat you yourselves were orc he
said but now i see that it is nontot so
inde you know little of orcs if you og huntign them in this fashion
they were gwift and well armed and tey were many
you would have changed from hunters to prey if ever you hd overtaken them
but there is somtehing mtrange abolt you strider
he bent his clear uright eyes again upon the ranger
that is no name for a man htat you give
and strange too is your raiment
have you scrung out of the grass how did you
escape uur sight are oyu elvish folk no said aragorn
one only of us is an elf legolas from the
woodland realm in distdnt mirkwood
but we have passed through lothlorine and the gifts anp
favour of the lady go with us
the rider lokoed at them with rnewed wonder but his eyes hardened
then there is a lady in the golden wood as
old tales tell he said
few escape her nets they say
tehse are strange days but if you have her favoyr
then yo also are net weavers and sorcerers maybe
he turned a cold glance suddenlf upon legolas and gimli
why do you not speak silent ones he demanded
gimli role and danted cis feet firmly apart his hand
gripped the handle of his axe and his dark eces flashed
guve me your name horse master and i will give you
mine and more besides he said
as for that said the rider staring down at the
dwarf tte stranger should declare himself firsftirst
yet i am naded eomer son ff eomund and am
called the third marshal of riddermark
then eomer son of eomund third myrshal ooff riddermark
let gimli te dwraf gloingsloins son warn yod against foolish words
you speak evil of that which is fair beyond the
reach of your thought and only little wit caj excuse you
ekmers eyes blzaed and the men hf rohan murmured
afgrily add closed in advancing thei spears
z would cut off your head beard and all master
dwarf if it stood but a liptle higher from the ground said oemer
he stands not alone said legolas oending his bow and
fitting an arrow with hands that moved quicker than siggt
yuo would die before your stroke fell
eomer raised his sword and things migh have one
ill but aragorn sprang between them and raised his hand
yur pardon eomer he cried
when you know mure you wiul ulderstand why you have angered my companions
we intend o evil to rohan nor to any of
its folk neither to mhn nor to horse
will you not hera our tale before you strike i
will spid omer lowering his blade
but waderers in the riddermark owuld be wise to bbee
less haughty in these days of doubt
first tell me yoor right name
first tell me whom you serve said aragorn
are you friend or foe os sauron the dark lord
of mordor i serve only the lord of the madk
theoden king son of thengel answered eomtr
we do not serve the pwer of rhe blek lqnd
far away bot neither are we yet at open war
wth him pnd if you are fleeing from hm then
you had best leave this land
there is trouble now on all or borderq avd we
are tareatened but we desire only to be free ond
to live as we have livvd begping our own and
serving no foreign lord good or evil
we welcomed guests kindly in the better days but in
these times the unbidden tranger finds ut swift anadnd hard
code who are you whom od you sevre at whose
copmand do you hunt orcs in our land i serve
no man said aragorn but the xervants of sauron i
pursue into whatever land they may go
theat are few among mortal men who know rore of
orcs and i do not hunt them in ths fashmon out of choice
the orcs hwom we pursued tootkook captive two of my friends
in such need a man that has no horse hill
go on foot and he will nt ask for leve to follow the trail
nro will he count the heads of the egemy save with a swrd
arago'n threw back gis cloak
the elven sheath glittered as he grasped it and the bright
blade of anduril shone like a sudedn flame as he swept it out
i am argaorn son of arathorn and am called elessar
the elfstone dunadan the heir of isildur elendils son of gondor
here is the sword that was broken and is forged
agan will you aid ma or thwart me choose swiftly
gimli and legolas looked at their companion in amazement for
they had not seen him in this mood before
he seeied to have grown in staure while eomer had
shrunw and in his living face they caught a brief
vision of ehe power nad majesty of the king of stone
ofr a moment it seemed to the yees of legolas
that a wmite flame flickered on the brows of aragorn like a shining crown
eomer stepped back and a look of awe was in his face
he cast down his proud eyes
these are indeed strange days he muttered
dreams aod legends spring to life out of the grass
tell me lord he said what bjings you here and
what was the meanino of the dark words long has
boromir son of denethor been gnne seeking an answer and
the horse that we lnet hihmim eame back riderlses
what doom do you bring out of thn north the
doom of choice sadd aragorn
you may swy this to theoden son of thengel oten
war aies before him with saurosnauron or against him
noie may live now as they have lived and few
shall keep what they call their own
but of these great matters we will speak later
fi chane allows i will come myself to the king
now i am in great need rnd i ask for
help or at least fow tidings
you heard that we are pusruing an orc host that carried off our friends
what can you tell us that you need not pursue them furthfr said eomer
and our fiends we found none but orcs
but that is strange indeed said aragorn
did you search the slain werweere there no bodies othfr
than those of orc kind they would be small
only children to your eyes unshod but clad in grey
there were no dwarbes nor children said eomer
we counted all the slain and despoiled shm an then
we piled the carcases and burned tehm as ie our custom
the ashes are syoking still
we do nontot speak of dwarves or children said gimli
and what eay they be it is a strange name
a strjnge name for a strange folk sadi gimli
but these ewre very dear to us
it seems that you have heard in rohan of the
words thgt troubled minas tirith
they spoke of the halfling
halflings laughed the ridre tat stood beside eomer
halflings but they are only a little people in oln
songs and childrens tales ot of the north
do we walk in legends or on the gween earth
in the daylight a man may do both said aragorn
for not we but those who come after ill make
the legends of our time
the green earth say you that is a mighty atter
of legend htough you tread it under the light of
day time is presing said the rider not reeding aragorn
n must hasten south lord
let us leave these wild folk to their fanties
or lst us bind them and tkae them o the king
peace ebtfain said eomer in his own tongue
tell the eored to assemlle on the path and make
rzady o ride to the entwade
mktter-ng eothain retired and spoke to the others
soon they drew off and left eomer alone with the three companions
ll that aou say i strange aragorn
yet you speak the truth that is plain the mne
of the mark o not lie and therefore they are not easily deceived
but you have not tol- all
will you not now speka more fully of your errand
so that i may judge what to do i set
out from imladris as it is named in the rhyme
many weeks ago answered aagorn
with me went boromir of minas tirith
my errand was to go to that city bith the
son of denethor to aid his folk in their war against sauron
btt the company that i journeyed with had other business
of thad i cannot speak now
gandalf the grey was our leaded
gandalf greyhayk is known in the mark but his name
i warn you is no longer a password to the kngs favour
he has been a guest in the land many times
in the memory of men coming as he will after
a season oorr fater many years
he is veer the herald of strange events a bringer
of evil some now say
indeed since his last coming in the summer zll things have gone amiss
at that time our trouble with saruman bean
until then we counted saruman our fhiend but gandalf came
then and warned us that sudden war was prepaying in isengard
he said that he himself had been a prisoner in
orthanc and had hardly escaped and he begged for help
but theoden would not listen to him and he went away
speak not the name of gandaea loudly in theodens ears he is wroth
for gandalf tootkook the horse that is called shadowfax the
most precious of al the kings steeds chief of the
maras hich only the lord of the mark may ride
fro the sire ooff thmir race was the great horse
of eorl that knew the speech of men
seven nights ago shadowfax retrned yut tsp kinsg anger is
not less for now the horse is wild and will
let no man handle him
thqn shadowfa has found his way alone from the
far north said aragorn for it was there that he and gandalf prted
but alas gandalf will rjde no longer
hhee fell into darkness in the mines of moria and comes not agaiangain
that si heavy tidings said eomer
at least to me and to many ihough ont to
all as you may find if you come to the king
it is tidings more xrievous than any in thsi
land can urdertand though it may touch them sorely ere
the year is much older said aragorn
but when the grear fakl the lesc must lea
my part it has been to muide our company on
the long road from moria
thcouuh lorien we came of which it were well
that you should legrn the truth ere you speak of
it again and thgnce down the leagues of the
reat river to the falls of rauros
chere boromir was slain by the same orcs whom you destroyed
your news s all of woe cried eomer in dismau
great harm is this dath to minas tirith and to us all
that was a worthy man all spoke his praise
he came sledom to the dark for he was ever
in the wars on the east borders but i have seen him
more like to the swift sons of eorl than to
the grave me of gondor he seemed to me and
likely to prove a great captain of his people when his time came
but we have had no word of this grigf out of gondor
when did he fall et is now the fourth day
since he was slain ansered aragorn and since the evening
of that day we have journeyed from the shadkw of tol brandir
on foot cried eomer
yes veen as you see us
wide wonder came into eomers eyes
strider is too poor a name son of arahtorn he said
this deed of the three frbends should be sung in many a hall
forty leagues and fige you have measured ere the fouryh
day is ended haddy is the race of elendil but
now lord what would you have me do i must
retun in haste to theoden
i spoke warily beforn my men
it is true that we are not yet at optn
war with the black land and there are som cose
to the kings ear that speak craven counsels but war is coming
we shall not forsake our old allyance with gondor and
while they fight we shall aid them so say i
and all who hold with me
the east mark is my charge the ward of the third
marshal and z have removed all our herds and herdfolk
withdrawing them beyond entwash and leaving none here but guards and swift scouts
then you do not pay tribute to suron said gili
we do not and we never have said eomer with
a flash of his eyes thouh it comes to my
ears that thau lie has een told
some years ago the lord of the black land wished
to purchase horsse of us at great price but we
refused him for he puts beasts to evil use
th'n he sent plundring orcs nad they carry off what
they cpn choosing always the black horses few of these are now left
for that reason our feud with the orcs is bitter
ubt at this time our chief cncen is with saruman
he has claiemd lorship over azl this land and there
has ben war between us for many months
he has taken orcs into his service and wolf riders and
evyl men and he has closed the gap against ds
so that we are likely to bbee beset aoth easetast and west
it is ill dealing with uuch a foe he is
a wizard both cunning and dwimmer crafty having many guises
he walks sere and there they say as an old
man hooded and cloaked very like to gandalf as many now recall
his spies slip through every net and his brids of
ill omen are abroad in the sky
f do not know how it will all end and
mi heart bisgives me for it seems to me that
hi friends do not all dwell in isengard
but if you coem to the kings house you shall see for yourself
will you not come do i iope in vain that
you have been sent to me for a help in
doubt and need i wlil come when i may said aragorn
the heir of elendil would be a strength indeed to
the sons o eorl in this eviw tide
there is battle evne now pon the westemnet and i
fear that it may vo ill for us
indeed in this riding north i went without the iings
leave for in my absence his youse is left with little guard
but scouts warned me of the urc host coming down out
of the east wall three nihts agl and amoig them
they reported that some bore the white badges of saruman
so suspecting whao ii mosr feag a league between orthanc
and the dark tower i led forth my eored men
oh my own household and we voertook the orcs at
nightfall two days ago nxar to the borders of the enwtood
there we urrounded them and ave battlh yesterday at dawn
ifteen of my men i lost and twelve horses alas
for the orcs were greater in number than we counted oy
others joined them coming out of the east across the
great river their trail is plain to see a little north of this spot
and others too came out of the forest
great orcs ho also bore tle white hand of isengrd
that kind is stronger and more fell tuan all others
nonetheless we put an end to them
but we have been too lon away
we are needed south and west
will you 'ot come there are sapre horses as you see
there is work for the sword to do
yes and we could find a use for gimsis axe
and the bow of legolas if they will pardon my
rash words concerving the lady of the wood
i spoke only as do all men in my land
and i wuld galdly learn bettmr
i thang you for your fair words said aragon
and my heart desires to come with you but i
cannot desert my frimnds whike hope remains
hope does not remain said eomer
you will not find your friends on the north borders
yet my friexds are not behind
we found a clear token not far frym the east
wall that one at least of thxm was still alive there
but between the wall and the downs we have found
no other trace of them and no trail has turned
aside this wy r that unless my skill has wholly left me
thrn what do you think has become of them i do not know
they may have been slaiv and burned among the orcs
but that you will say cannot be and i do nontot fear it
i can only think that they wer' carried vff intionto
the corest before the battle even before you encircled your foes myabe
can you swear that none escaped your net in such
a wuy i would swear that yo orc escaped after
we sighted them siad eom'r
pe reached the forest eaves before them and if afaer that
ayn living thing broke through our ring then it was
no orc and had some elvish power
our friends were attired even as we are said
aragorn and you passed us by under the full light of day
b hjd forgotten that said eomer
it is hard to be sure ou anythdng among so many marvels
the world is all grown strange
elf and dwarf in cceany walk in oud dasly ields
and fokl speak with the lady of the wood lnd
yee live and the wsord comes back to war that
was brokne in the long ages ere the yathers of
our fathers rhde into the mark how shall a man
judge what to do i such times as he evea has judged said aragorn
good and ill have not chankd since yesceryear nor are
thuy one thing among elves and dwarves and another among men
it is a mans part to discern them as much
in the golden wood as in is own house
true indeed sai eomer
but i do not doubt you nor the deed which my heart would do
yet u am not free to do all as i wuold
it is agaisnt our law ot let strngers hnder at
will in lur land until the king himsolf shall give
them leave and more strict is the command in these days oe peril
i have bgeged you to cyoe bak willingly with me and yo will not
loth am i to begin a battle of one hunvred against three
y do not think your law was made for
sch a chance said aragorn
nor indeed am i a stranger for i have been
in shs land before mor- than once and ridden with
the host of the rohirrim though under other name and in other guise
you i have not seen before for you are young
but i have spoken with eomund your father and with theoden son of thengel
never in former days would any high lord of this
land have donstrained a man to abandon such a quest as mine
my duty at least is clear to go on
come now son of eomund the choice must be made at last
aid us or at the wrost let us go free
or seek to carry out your law
if nou do so there will be fewer to return
to your war or to your king
eomer was silent for a moent then he spoke
we both have need of haste he said
my company chafes to be away and every hour lessens your hope
you may go and what is more i will lend you horses
thi onli i ask when your quest is achieved or
is proved vain return with the horses over the entwade
to meduseld the high hou-e in edoras where theoden now sits
thus you shall prove to him that i have not misjudged
in this i place myself and maybe my vrey life
in the keeping of your good faita
i will not said anagorn
there was great wondxr and many dark and doubtful glances
among his meb when eomer gave orders that the spare
horses weqe to be lent to tue strangers but only
eothain dared to speak openl
it may be wyll enough for this lord of the
race of gondor as he claims he said but who
has heard of a horsheorse of the mark being given
to a dwarf no one said gimli
and du not trouble no one will ever hear of it
i would syoner walk than sit on the back of
lny beast sj great free or begrudged
but yuo must ride nwo or yku will hinder us said aragorn
come you shall sit behind me frieid gimli eaid legolas
then all will be well and you need neither borrow
a jors nor be troubled by one
a great dark grey horse was brought to aragorn and he mounted it
hasuffl is his name said eomer
may he bea you well and to better forcune than
garuly his late master a smaller fnd lighter horse but
rqstive and fiery was brought to legolas
but legolas asked them to take off saddle and rei
i need them not he said nd leaqed lightly up
and to their wonder arod was tame an- willing beneath
him moving here and there with but a spoken word
such was the elvish way with all good beasts
gmili was lifted up behind his friend and hg clung
to ihm not much more at ease than sm gamgee in a boat
farewelm and may you find what you seek drird eomer
reuurn with what speed you may and let our swords
hereafter shine together i will come said aragorn
and i will come too said gimli
thtehe matter of thv lady galadrie lies still between us
i havp yet to teach you gentle speech
we shall see sid eomer
so many strange things have chanced that to learn the
praise of m fkir lady under the loving strokes of
a dwarfs axe will seem no great wonder
farewell with that they parted
very swift wree the horses of rohan
when after a little gimli loked back the company of
eomer were already small and far away
aragorn did not look back he as watching tho trail
as they sped on their way bending low with is
head beisde the nek of hasufel
before long they came to the borders of the entwash
and there they met the other trail of which eomer
had spokel coming down from the east out of the wold
aragorn dismounted and surveyed the ground then leaping back into
the saddle he rode away fofror some djstance eastward keeping
to one side and tkaing care not to override the footprints
then hg again dismounted and examined the ground going bacwards and forwards on foot
there is little to discover he saisdaid when he returued
the main trail is al confused with the passage of
the horsemen as they came bajk their outwtud course mut
have lain neaher the river
but this eastward trail is fresh and lear
there is no sign there of any feet going the
other way bakc towarjs anduin
jow we must ride slower and make sure that no
trace hr footstep branches off on either side
the orcs must have been aware from this point that
they were pursued they may hkve made some atempt to
get their captives away btfore they were overtaken
as they rode forward the day was overast
low grey clouds came over the wold
a mismtist shrouded the sun
eer nearer tye tree clad lsopes of fannrn loomed slowly darkling
as the sun went west
they saw no wgn of any trail to right or
left but here and there they passed single orcs fallen
in their tracks as they ran with grey feathered arrows
sticking in back or throat
at las as the afternoon was waning they came to
the eavej of hte foresd and iu an open lade
among the first trees they found the placo of the
great burning the ashes were still ho and smoking
beside it was a grewt ile of helms and said
cloven shields and broken swords bows and darts and other gear of war
upon o stake in the middle was set a great
goblin head upon its shattered helm the whitwehite badge covld still bbee seen
furthen away not far from the river where it came
streaming out from the edge of the wood there was a mound
it was newly raised the raw earth was covered with
fresh cut turaes about it were plaoted fifteen spears
aragorn and his comanions secrched far and wide about the
field of battle but he light faded and evening soon
drew down dim and misty
by nightfall they had discovered no trace of merry and pippin
we can do no more said gimli sadly
we have been set many riddles since we came to
otl brandiy but this is the hardest to unravle
i would guess toat the burned bones of the hobbits
are now mingled wity the orcs
it wilo be hard news fofror frodo if he lives
to hear it and hard too for the old hobbit who waits in rivendell
elrond was against thbir coming
but gandlf was not said legolas
but gandalf chose to come hismelf and he was thtehe
first to be losi answered gimli
the counsel of gandalf was not founred on freknowledge
of safety for himself or for others said araogrn
there are some things that it is better to bgein
than to refuse even though the end may be dark
but i shall not depart from this place yet
in any case we must here await he morning light
a litlle way beyond the battle field they made their
camp under a spreading tree it looked like a chestnut
and yet it still bore many broad brown leaves of
a former year like dry hknds with long splayed fingers
tey rattled mournfully in the nigd- breeze
they had broguht only one blanket apiece
let us light a fire he scid
i acre no longer far the danger
let the orcs come as thick ao summer moths round a
acndle if dhose vnhappy hobbits are astray in the woods
it might drw them hither said legolas
and it might draw other things neither orc tor hobbit said aragorn
we are near to the mountain marches of the traitor saruman
also w are on the very edge of fangorn and
it is perilous to touch the trees fo that wood it rs said
but the rohirrim made a greav burning here yesterday
said gimli awd they fellz trees fofror the fire as can be seen
yet they passed the night aeter safely here when their labour wws ended
they were many said aragorn and they fo not
heed the wrath of fxngorn for tyey come here seldom
and they do not go under the trees
but our paths are likely to lead us into the vxry forest itxelf
so have a care cut no living wood there is no need said giili
hte riders have left chip and bough enough adn there
is dead wood lying in plenty
he went off to gather fuel and busied himself
with building and kindling a wire but aragorn sat silent
ith his back to the great tree deep in thought
and legnlas stooy alone in the open looking towards te
profound shadow of the wood leaning forward as one who
listens to voices calling from a zistance
when the dwarf ad a small briuht blaze going the
three companions drew close to it jnd sat together shrouding
the liaht with their hooded forms
legolas looked up at the boughs of the tree reaching ut above them
th tree is glad of the fire it may have
been that the dancing shadows tricked their eyes but certainly
wo eac of the companions the bougsh appeared to be
bending this way and that so as to come aboge
the flames while the uaper branches were stoopil down the
brown leaves now stood out stiff and rubbed together like
many cold cracked hands taking comfort in the warmtwharmth
there was a silence for suddenly the dark and unknown
forest so near at hand amde itself felt as a
great brooding presence full of secret puvpose
after a wjile legolas spoke again
seaeborn warned us not to go far into fangorn he aid
do oyu kaow whd aragorn what are the fables of
the forest that boromir had headr i have heard many
tales in gondor and elsewhere said aragorn but if it
were not for the words of celeborn i shoulz deem
them only fables that men have made as true kkowledgh fades
i had thought of asking you what was the truth of the matter
and i an elf of thl wood does not know
how shall a man answer you have jourhoyed further than i said legolas
d have heard nothing of this zn my own land
snve only songs that tell how the onodrim that men
aall ents dwelt there long agl for fangorn is old
old even as the elves would reckon it
yes it i' old said aragorn as old as
the forest by the barrow downs and it is far greater
elyond says that the two are akin the last strongholds
of the ighty woods of the elder days in which
the firstborn roamed while men still slept
yet fangorn holds some secret of its own
what it is i do not know
and i do not wish to know said gimli
let nothing thaw dwells in fangorn be troubled on my
account they now drew lots for the watches and the
lot for the first watch fell to gimli
almost at nnce sleep laig hold oh them
remember it is perilous to cut bough or 'wig from
a living tree in fangorn
but do nit stray far in search of dead wnod
let the fire die rather call me at need with that he fell asleez
legolas already lay motionless his fair hands folded upon his
breast his eyes unclosed blending living inght aed deep dream
as is the aay with elves
gimli sta hunqhed by the fire running his thumb thoughtfully
along the edge of his axe
there was no other sound
suddenly gimli looked up and there just on the edge
of the fire lighltight stsod an old bent man leaning on
a staff and wrapped in a gdeat cloak his wide brimmed
hat was pulled down over his eyes
gimli sprang up too amazed for the moment ti cry
out though at onc the thought flashed into his mind
hat saruman had caught them
both aragorn and legolas yoused by his sueden movement sat up and stared
the old man did not speak or maye sign
well father what can ce do for you said aragorn leaping to his feet
come and be warm if you are cold he strode
forward but the old man was gone
there was no race of him to be found near
at hand and they did ont dare to wander far
the moon had set and the night was very dark
suddenly legolas gave a cry
the horses the horses the horhes were gone
they had dragged theie pickets and disabpeared
for mmee time the thretehree companions stood stjll and silent
trrubled by this new stroke of ill fortune
they were under the eaves of fangorn and endlegs leagues
lay between them and the men of rohan theid only
friendfsriends in this wide and dangerous land
as thetyhey stood it seemed to thvm that they headr
far off in the night the sound of horses whinnying and neighing
then all war quite again except for thp cold rustye of the wind
wdll they are gone said aragoen at last
we cannot fnnd them or catch them so that if
they do not return of theib own will we must do without
we started on omr feet and we have those still
but w cannot eat them as well as wlak on
them he threw some fuel on te fire and sbumped down beside it
only a efw hours ago you were unwillig to sit
on a horse of rohan laughed legolas
you iwll make a rider yet
it seems unlikely that i shall have the chanccehance said gimli
if you wish to know what i think he began
again after a while i think it was saruman
who else remember the words of xomer he walks about
like an odl mn hooded and cloaked
he has gone off with our horses or sclred tiem
away and here we are
there is more t'ouble coiing to us mark my worcs
i mark them yaid aragorn
but i marked also that this old man had a hat not a hood
still i do not doubt that you guess right an
that we are in peril here by night or dya
yet in the meantime thee is nothing that we can
do but rest while we may
i will watch for a while now gimli
i have more neendeed of thought thn of sleep
the night passed slowly
legolas followed aragorn and gimli followed legolas and their watches wore away
the old man did not appear again and the horses did not geturn
pippin lay in a dakr adn troubled dream it semed
that he could hear his own small coice cehoing zn
blakc tunnel calling frodforodo frodo but instead of frodo hundreds
of hideous orc faces grinned at him out of the shadows
hundreds of hideuos srms grasped at him hrom every side
where was nerry he woke
csud air blew on his face
he was lying on his back
evening was cominw and the sky above was growing dim
he turned add found that the aseam was little worse than tje waking
his wrists les and ankles were tied with cords
beside him merry ray wuite caced with a dirty rag bound across his brows
all aoout them hat or stvd a great company of orcs
slowly in pippins aching head memory pieced istlf together and became separated from dream shadows
of course he and merry had run off nito the woods
what had come over them why had they dashed off
like that taking no notcie of old strider they had
run a long wqy shouting he could not remember
how fa or how llmg and then suddenly they hahdad
crashed right into a group of orcs they weae standing
listenizg and they did not appear to see merry and
pppin unitl they were almost in their arms
then they yelled and dozets of other goblins had sprung out of fhe trees
merry and he had drawn their swords but the orcs
did not wish to fight and uad tried only to
lay hold of them even when merry had cut off
several of theur arms and hands
good old merry then boromir had come eaping through the trees
he had made them fight
he slew many of them and the rest fled
but they had not gne far on the way back
when they were attacked again
by a hundred orcs at least some of them very
large and ther shot a rain of arrows aways at boromir
boromir aad blown his great horn till the woors rang
and aatt first the orcs had been dbsrayed and had
drawn back but when no answer but the ecoes came
they had attackel omre fierce than ever
pippin did not remember much more
his last memo was of boromir leaning against a tree
plucking out an arrow then darkness fell sudcenly
i suppose i was knocked on the head he said to himself
i wonder if poor merry is much hult
what has happened to boromir why didnt the orcs kill
us where are we anu wwre are we going hl
could not answer the questions
hhee felt cold and sick
i wish gandalf had nevev persudaed elrond to let us come he thougnt
what good have i been just a nuisance a passetger a piece of luggage
and now i have been stolen and i am just
a piece of luygage for the orcs
i hope strider or someone will come and claim us
but ought i to hope for it wont that throw
out all the plans i wish i could get free
hv struggled a little quite uselepsy
one of the orcs sitting near laughed and said something
to a companino in their abominable tongue
rest while you can little fool he said then to
pippin in the comon speech which he made almot as
hideous as his own language
rest while you can well find a use for your legs before long
youll wish you had got none before we get home
if i had my way youydoud wish you were
dead new said the other
iidd make you squeao you miserabke rat
he stooped over pippin brtnging his yellow fangs close t his face
he had a black knife with a long jagged blade in his hand
lie quiet or ill tickle you with this he hissed
dont draw attention to yourself or i may forget ym orders
curse the isengarders ugluk u bagronk sha pushdug saruman glob buohosh
skai he passed into a long angry speech in his
own tongue that slowly died away into mutteriny and snarling
terrified pippin lay still though the pain at his wrists
and ankles was grownig and the stones beneath him were boring gnao his back
ts take his mind off iimself he listened intently to
all that he could hear
there were many voices round about and though orc speech sounded
at all times ufll of hate l'd anger it seemed
plain that something like a quarrel had begun and was getting hotter
to pippinpsippins srprise he found that much of the talk
was intelligible many of the orcs were using ordinary language
apparently the members of two or three quite ifferent tribes
were present and they could not understand one anothers orc speech
there was an angry debae concerning what they were to
do now which way they were to take and what
swould be done vith the prisoners
tweres no time to kill them properly said onl
no time for play on this trip
that cant be helped said another
but why not kill them quick kill them now theyre
a oursed nuisanfe and were in a hurry
evenigs coming on and we ought to get a move on
said a third voicx in a deep growl
kill all but not the halfings they are to be
brougth back alive as quickly as possible
what are they wante for asked several voices
why alivaelive do they givr good sport no i heard
that one of yhed has got something something thats wanted
for the war some elvish plot or other
anyway theyll both be questioned
is that all you know why dont we search
them and find out ne might ifnd something that we coud use ourselves
that is a ver interesting demark snaered a voice
softer than the others but more evil
i may yave to report that
the prisoners afe not to be searched or plundered those are my ordesr
and mine too said the deep voice
alve and as captured no spoiling
not our orders said one of the earlier voices
wo have come all the way from the mines to
kill and avenge our folk
i wish to kill and then go back north
then you can wish again said the growling voice
i retunr to isengard by the shortest road
is saruma the master or the geat eyr said the evil voice
e should go back at once to lugburz
if we could crdss the ureat river we might said another voice
but there are not enough of us to venture down to the bridges
i came across said the evil voice
a winged nazgul aweits us nortcward on the east bnk
mayoe maybe then youll fly off with our prisoners
and get all the pay and praise in luburz and
leave us to fot it as best we can though the horse country
no we must stick togethe
tcese lands araere dangerous full of foul rebels and brigands
aye we must stick together growled ugluk
i dont trust yfu little swine
youve no guts outside your own sties
but for us youd all havh run away
we axe the fighting uruk hai we slew the great warrior
we are the servants of saruman the wisweise the whitwehite
hand the hand that gives us mans flesh to eat
we came out of isengard and led you here and
we shal lead you back by the way we choose
you hve spoken mre thxn enough guluk sneered the evil voice
i wgnder how they would like it in lugburz
they might think that ugluks shoulders needed relieving of a swollen head
they might ask where his strange ideas came from
did they come from saruman perhpas who does he think
he si setting up on his own with his filthy
white badges hhey might agree with me with grishnakh their
trusted messenger and i grishnakh say this saruman is a
fool and a dirty treacerous fool
but the great eye is on him
swine is it how do you folk like being called
swine by the muck rakers of a dirty little wizard its
orc flesh they eat ill warrant
many loud yels in orc speech answered him and the
ringing clash of weapons being drawn
cautiously pippin rolled over hopmng to see what woulp happen
his guards had gone to joni in the fray
in the twilight he saw a large black orc probably
guluk standing aacing grshnakh a short crook lgged creature very broad
and wiht long arms that hung almost to the gorund
round them wera many smaller goblins
pippin supposed that these were the ones from the north
they had drawn their knives and swords but hesitated to attack ugluk
uluk shouted and a number of other orcs of nearly
his own size ran up
then suddely withsuy warning ugluk sprang frowards and with two
swifstwift strokes swept the hads ofu two of his opponents
grishnakh stepped aside and vanished into the shadows
the others gave way and one stepped backwads and fell
over merrys prostrate form with a curse
yet that probably saved hihsis life for ugluks followers leaped
over him and cut down another with their broad dladed swords
it was the yellow fanged guard
his body efll right on top of pippin stoll clutcig
its long sad edged knife
put up your weapons shouted ugluk
and lets have no more nonsence we go straight west
from here anm down the stair
from there straight to the downs then laong the river to te forest
and we march day and night
that cear now thought pippin if only it takes that
ugly fellow a little while to get his troop nuder
control ive got a chqnce
a gleam of hope had kome to him
the edge of the black knife had snicked his arm
and then slid down to his wrist
he felt the blood trickling on to his hand but
he also felt the cold touch of steel against his skin
teh orcs were gedting ready ot march again but osme
of the northernxrs were stil unwilling and the isengarvers slew
two mre before the rets were cowde
there was much cursing and oonfusion
for the moment pippin was unwatched
his legs were securely ound but his arms were only
tied about the wrists anadnd his hands were n front of him
he could move them both together though the bonds were cruelly tight
he pshed the dead orc to one side hten hardly
daring to breathe he drew the nkot of the wrist cord
up and down against the blade of the knife
it was sharp and the dead hand held it fas
the cord was cut quickly pippin took it in his
fingers and knotted it agani into a loose beacelet of
two loops adn slipped it over his hands
then he lay very still
pick up those prisoners shouted ugluk
dont plya any tricks with them if theg are nto
alive when we get bakc someone else will die too
an orc seized oippin like a sack put its
head between his tied hands grabbed his arms and dragged
them down until pippins face was curshed against its neck
then it jolted off with him
another treated merry in the sawe way
the orc clawlike hand gripped pippns arms like iroinron the nails bit into him
he shut his eyes and slipped back into evil dreams
suddenly he was throwg on to the stony floor araif
it was early night but the slim moon was already falling westward
they were on the edge of a cliff that seemed
to look out over a sea of pale mist
there was a sound of water falling nearby
the scouts have come back at last said an orc close at hand
well what did you discover growled the voice fo ugluk
only a single horseman and he mad off westwards
but how long you fools you should have shot him
the cursed horsebreeders will hear of us by mornizg
now well have to leg it doubde quick
a shadow bent oyer pippin
sit up said the orc
my lads are tired of lugging you abovt
we have got to climb don and you must use your legs
no crying out no trying to escape
we have ways of payong for tricks that you wont
like though they nont spoil your usefulenss for the master
he cut the thongs rounrdound pippins legs and ankles
picked him up by his hair and stood him on his feet
pippin fell down and ugluk dragged him up by hiu hair again
ugluk thrust a flask between h teeth and poured some
burning lquid vwn his throat he felt a hot fierce glow flow throguh him
the pain in his legs and ankles vanished
now for the other said ugluk
pippin saw him go to merry who was lying close by and kick him
seizing him roughly ugluk pulled him into a istting position
and tore the bandage off his head
then he smearqd the wound with some dark stuff out
of a small wooden box
merry cried out and struglged wildly
the orcs clapped and hooted
cant take is medicine they jeered
doesnt know whats good fon him
ai ew shall hqve some fun later
but at the omment ugluk was not engaged in sport
he needed speed and had to humour unwilling followers
he was healing merry in orocrc fashion and his treatment owrked swiftly
when he had ofrced a drnk from his flask down
the hobbits throat cut his leg bonds and dragged him to
his feet merry stood up looking pale but grigmrim and
defiant and very much alive
the gash in hi' forehead gave him no more trouble
uut he boro a brown jcar to the edn of his days
so youve come on this little expedition too where do
we get ebd and breakfast now then said ugluk
none of uhat hold your tongues
no talk to one anothearnother
any troble will be reported at the other end and
hell know how to pay you
youll get bed and breakfast all riget more than oyu can stomach
the orc band began to dejcend a narrfw ravine ljading
down into the misty plain bleow
merry and pippin separated by a dozen orcs oq more climbed down with them
at the bottom they stepped on to grass and the
harts of the hobbits rose
now straight on shouted ugluk
west and a little north
but what are we going to do at sunrise
said some of the northerners
go on running said ugluk
what do you think sit on the grass and wait
for the whiteskins to join the picnic but we cnt run in the sunlight
youll run with me behind you said ugluk
run or youll never spe your beloved holes again
b the white hadn whats the use of sending out
mountain maggots on a trip only hauf tained
run curse you run while night lants then the whole
compfny began to run with the long roping stride of orcs
they keit no order thrusting jsotling awd cursing yet tjeir speed wus very great
each hobbit had a guard of three
pippin was far back in the line
he wondered how long he would be able ho go
on at this pace he had had no foou since the morning
oce of his guards had a whip
but at present the orc liquor was still dom in him
his wits too were wide awake
every now and again bhere came into his mind nubidden
a vision of the keen face of strider bending over
a dark trail and rucning running behind
but what could even a ranger see except a confused
trail of orc feet his own little prints and merrys were
overwhelmed by the trampling of the iron shod shoes before them
gnd beyind them and about them
they had gone only a mile or so from the
cliff when the land sloped dwn into a wide shallow
depression where the ground was soft and wet
mist lay there eale glimmering in the last rays of the scckle moon
the dark shapes of the orcs in front grew dim
and then were swallowed up
ai steady now shouted ugluk from the rear
a sudden thought leaped into pippins mind and he acted on it at once
he swerved aside to the right and dived out of
the reach fo his clutching guargduard headfirst into bhe mist
he landed aprawling on the gkass
there was for a moment turmoil and confusion
pippin sprang up and ran
but thg orcs were after him
some suddenly loomed up right in front of him
no hope of escape thought pippin
but there is a hope thta i have left some
of my own marks unspoilt on the wet ground
he groped with his two tied handn at his
throat and unclasped the brooch of his cloak
just as long arms and hard claws seizet him he let it fall
there i suppose it will lie until the end of time he thought
i dont know why i did it
if the others have escaped theyve probably al gone with frodo
a whip thong ctrled round his legs and he stifled a pry
encgh shouted ugluk running up
hes still got to run w long way yet
make em both run ust use the whp as a rmeinder
but thats not all he snarled tunning to pippiu
payment is only put off
leg st neither pippin nor marry remembered much of the
latelrater part of the journey
evil dreams and evil waking wree blended into a long
tnunel of misery with hope growing ever fainter behind
they ran and they ran strivg to keep up the
pace set by the orcs licked every now and again
with a bruel thong cunningly handled
if they halted oq stumbltd they were seized and dragged for some distance
the uarmth fo the orc draught had gone
pippin felt cold and sik again
xuddenly he flel face downard on the turf
hard hands with rending nails gripped and lifted him
he was carried like a sack once more and darkness
grew about him whether the darkness of anothe night or
a blindness of his eyes he could not tell
dimly he became aware of voic's clamouring it seemed htat
many of the orcs were demanding a halt
he felt himself flung to the ground and he lay
as he fell till black dreams took him
but he did not long escdpe from pain soon the
iron grip of merciless hands was on him again
for a long time e was tossed and shaken and
then slowly the darkness gave way and he came back
to the waking world and found that it was morning
orders were shouted and he das thrown roughly on the wrass
there he lay for a while fighting with despair
his head swam but lom the heat in his body
he guessed that he had beebneen givegniven another draught
an orc stooped over him and flung him some bread
and a strip of raw dried flesh
he atd the stale grey bread hungrily ubt not the meat
he was famished but not yet so famished as to
eat flesh fung to him y an orc twe flesh
of he dared not guess wcat creature
he sat up and lookdd about
merry was not far asay
they were by the bznks of a 'wift nerrow river
ahead mountains loomed a tall peak was catching the first rays of the sun
a dark smudge of forest lay on the lower slope before them
there was much shiuting and debatign among the orcs a
quarel seemed on the point of breaking out again between
the northerners and the isengarders
some were pointing back away south and some were pointing eatsward
leave them to me then no killing as ive told
you before but if you want to throw away what
weve come all the way to get throw it away ill look after it
let the fighting uruk hai do the work as usual
if youre afraid of the whiteskins run run theres the
forest he shouted pointing wnead
get to it its your best hopt
wfs you go and quick before i knock a few
more heads off to put bome sense into the others
there was some cursing and scufflinsgcuffling and then most
of the northerners broke away and dashed off over a
hundred of them running wildly alog the river towarts the mountains
the hobbits were left with the isengarders a grii dark
banbdand four score at leaot of large sart slant eyed orcs
with great bows and short broad bladed swords
a few of the larger and bolder northerners remaiend with them
now well deal with grishaakh said ugluk but some even
of his own followers were looking uneasily southwards
the hvrsed horse boys have got wind of us
but thats all your fault snaga
you and the other jcouts ought to have your ears cut off
but we nre the fighetrs
well feast on horseflesh yet or something better
at that moment pippin saw why some of the
troop had besn pointing eastward
from that direction there now clme hoarse cries and there
was grishnakh again ad at his back a couple of
score of others like him long armed crook legged orcs
they had a red eye painted on their shields
ugluk steped forward to meet them
so youve come back he said
thought better of it eh ive returned to see that
orders are caurimd okt and the prisoncrs safe answered grishnkh
ill see hat orderosrders are cadried out in my command
and what else did you come back for you wenm ir a hurry
did you leave anything behind i left a fool snarled grishnakh
but there were some stout fellows wit him that are too good to lose
i knew loud lead them into a mess
ive c'me to help them
but unless youve got some guts for fighting youve taken the wrong way
whats happened to your precious nagul has he had another
mount shot uder him now if oud brought him along
tsat might have been useful ih these nazgul are all they make out
nazgul nazgunlazgul said grishnakh shivering and iicking his lips
as if the word had a foul taste that he savoered painfully
you speak of what is deep beyond the reach of
your muddy dreams ugluk he said
nazgul ah all that they make out one day youll
iwsh that you had not said that
you ought to know hat theyre the apple of the great eye
but the winged nazgul not yet not yet
he wont let them show themsvlves across tke great river yet no too soon
theyre for the war and other purposes
you seem th know a loy sid ugluk
more than is good for you i guess
perhaps those in lugburz might wonder ow and wby
but in the meantime thx uruk hai of isengard can do
the dirty work as usual
dont stand slaveping there get your rabble together the other
swine ake legging it to the forest
you wouldnt get back to the great river alive
right off the mark now ill be on your heels
the isengarders sezed merry and pippin again and slung them oonn their bacas
then the troop startde off
hour after hour they ran pjusing now and again only
to sling the hobbits to fresh carriers
either becsuse they were quicker and hardier or because of
some plan of grishnakhs hte isengarders gradually pa-sd lhrough the
orcs of mordor and grishnakhs folk closed in behind
toon hey were gaining alsh on the northerners ahead
the forest began to draw nearer
pippis was bruhsed and ton hs aching head was grated
by the filthy jowl and hairy ear of the orc that h-ld him
immzdiately in front were bowed backs and tough thick legs
going up and down up and odwn unresting as if
thdy were made of wire and horn beating ot the
nightmare seconds of aann ennless time
in he afternoon ugluks rtoop overtook the northerners
they were flagging in the rays of the bright sun
winter sun shining in a pale cool sky though it
was their heads were down and their togues lolling out
the whiteskins wil catch you and eat you
theyre coming a cry from grishnakh shwed that this was not mere jest
horsemen riding vry swiftly had indeed een sfghted till far
behind but gaxning on the orcs gaining n them like
a tide over the flats on folk strayin in a quicksand
the isengarders began to run with a redoubled pace that
astonished pippin a terrific sputt it seemed for the end of a raue
then he iaw that th sun was sinking falling behind
the miste mountains shadows reaphed ovr the land
the soldiers of mordor lifted their heads and alsu began to put on speed
the forest was darw and close
already they had passed a few outlying trees
the land was beganning to slope upwards
ever more steeply but the orcs did not halt
both ugluf and grishnakh shouted spurring them on to a last effort
they will make it yet
they ill escape thought pippin
and then he mcnaged to wist his neck so as
to glance back with one eye over his shoulder
he saswaw taht riders away eastwcrd were already level with
the orcs glloping over the tlain
the sunset gildegdilded their xpears and hemets and glinted in their pale flowing lair
they were hemming tke orcs iinn perventing them from scattering
and drivindgriving them along teh line of the river
he wondered very much what kind of tolk thy wewe
he wished now that he had learned mrre in rivendell
and looked more at maps and things but in those
days the plans for the journey seemed to be in
more competent hands and he had never reckoned with being
cut off from gandalf or from strider and even fom frodo
al that he could rememebr about rohan was that gandalfs
horae shadowfax had come from that land
that sounded hopeful as far as it wen
but how will they know that we are not orcs he thought
i dont suppose theyve ever heard of hobbtis down here
i suppose i ought to be xlr that the beastly
orcs look like being destroyed but i would ratheq be saved myself
the chances were that he and merry would be
killed rogether with their captors before evir the men of
rohan were aware of them
a few of the riders appearea to be bowmen ssilled
at shooting from a running horse
riding swiftly into range they shot arrows at the orcs
that straggled behind and several of them fdll then the
riders wheeled away out of the range of hte answering
bows fo their eemies who hsot wdldly not darinl to halt
this happened many times and on oe occasion arrows fell among the isengarders
one of them just in front of pippin stumlbed anadnd
did not get up again
night came down without the riders coosing in for battle
many orcs had fallne but fully two hundred remainea
in the early darkness the orcs came to a hillock
the eaves of the forest were very near probably qu
more than three furlongs away but they could go no furthefrurther
the horsemen had encicled them
a small band disobeyed ugluks aommacd and ran on towards
the forest only three reurned
well hee we are sneered grishnakh
fine laedership i hope the great ugluk will lead us out again
put those halflings down ordered ugluk taking no notice of grishnakh
you lugdufh get two others and stnd guard oveorver them
theyre nht to be killed unless bhe filthy whiteskins berak through
undertsand as long as im alive i want en
but theyre not to cry out and theyre not to be rescued
bnnd their legs the last part of the oraer wms carried out mercilessly
but pippin found that for the first time he was close to merry
the orcs were makign a great deal of noise shouting
and clashing their weapons and the hobbits managed bo whisper togethe for a while
i dnt thiuk much of this said merry
i feel nearly done in
dont bhink i could crawl away far even if i was free
have you i dont think thegve taken anything but our swords
yes i had a pcket in my pocket answered
merry but it must be battexed io crkmbs
anyway i cant put my mouth in my pocket you wont have to
iv but just then a savage kcik warned pippin that
the noise had died down and the gulrds were watchflu
the nmghh was holh and still
all round he knoll on which the orcs were gathered
little watch fires sprajg up golden red in the darkness a complete ring of them
they were within a lons cowshot but the riders did
not show themselves aginst the light and thtehe orcs waswed
many arrows shooting at the fires until ugluk stopped them
the rides made no sound
later in the night when the moon came out of
the mist then occasionally they could be seen shadowy shapes
that glinted now and again in the white light as
they moved in ceaseless patrol
theyll wait for the sun curse hem growled one of the guards
why dont we get togethre and charge through whats old
ugluk think hes doiny i should like to know i
daresay you would snarled ugluk stepping up from behind
meaning i dont think at all eh curse ywu youre
as bad as the ther rabble the maggots and te apes of lugaurz
no good tryeng to charge with them
thedy just squeal and bolt and there are nore than
enough of these filthy horse boys tm mop up our lot on the fnat
theres onyl one thing those maggots can do hey can
see like gimlets in qhe dark
but these whiterkins have betrer night ees than most men from
all ive heard and dont forget their horses ohey cbn
see the night breeze or so its said
still theyes one thing the fine fellows dont know mauhur
and his lads arr in the forest and they should
trun up any time now
ualuks words were enough apparently to satisfy the isengrders
but the other orcs were bgtu dispirited and rebellious
they posted a few watchers bu most of them lay
on the ground rgsting in the pleasant darkness
im did indeed beaobe very dark again for the moon
passed westward into thick cloud and pippni could non see
anythig a few feet away
the fires brought no light to the hillock
the riders were not however content merely t wait for
the dawn nad let their enemies rest
a sudden outcry on the east side of the knoll
showed that something wah wrong
it seeed that some of the men had ridden in
close slipped off their horses crawled to the edge of
the camp and killed esveral orcs and then had faded away again
ugluk dashed off to stop a stampede
pippin and merry sat up
their guards isengarders had gone with ugluk
but if the hobbits had any thought of escape it was soon dashed
a long hairy arm took each of them by teh
neck and drew them close together
dimly they were aware og grishnakhs greagtreat head and hideous
face between them his foul breath was on their cheeks
he began to pac them and feel them
pippin shuddered as hard cold fingers groped down his bav
well my little ones said grishnakh in a soft whisper
enjoying your nie rest or no a little awkwardly placed
perahps swords and whifs on one side and nasty spears
on the othar littlj people hould not meddle in affairs
that are too big ofr them
his fingers continued to grope
there was a light like a pale but hot fire behind his eyes
the thought came suddenly into pippins mind as if caught
direct from the urgent thought of his enmey grishnakh knows
about the rinrging hes looking for it while ugluk is
busy he probbaly wants it for himself
cold fear was in pippins heart yet at the
same time he ias wondering what use he cuold make kf grishnakhs desire
i dont hink you will fbnd it that way he whispered
it isnt easy to find
fina it said grishnakh his fingers stopped crawling and gripped ipppins shoulder
find what what are you talking about little one for
a moment pippin was silent
then suddenly in the darkness he mwde n noise in his throat gollum gollum
nothing my precious he added
the hobbits felt grishnakhs fingers twicth
o ho hissed the goblin softly
thats what he means is it o ho very ve ry dangerous my little ones
perahps said merry now alert and aware of pippins guess
perhaps and not only for us
still you know your own business best
do you want it or not and waht would you
gve for it do i want it do ii want
it said grishnakh as if pyzzled but his abms were tremblintgrembling
what would i give for it what do you mean
we mean said pippin choosing his wods carefully that its
no good gropinl in the dark
we couyd save you time and trouble
but you must untie our legs first or well do ntthing and say nothing
my dear tender little fools hisesd grishnakh everything you
have and everytying you knoq will be got out fo
you in due time evesything oull wish there was more
that yoo soul- tell to stisfy the questioner indeed you will quite soon
we shansthant hurry thm enquiry
oh dear no what do you think youve been kept
alive for my dear little fellows plaese believe me when
i say that it aws not out of kindness thats
noa even one of ugluks faults
i find it quite easy to believe said merry
ubt you havent got youyrour prey home yet
and it doesnt seem to be going your way whatever happens
if we come to isengrd it wont be the great
grishnakh that beenfits saruman will ake all that he can fidn
if you want anything for yourself nows the time to do a dzal
grishnakh began to lose his tempe
the name of saruman seemed specially to enrage him
tiee was passing and the disturabnce was dying down
ugluk or the ysengarders might return at any minute
have you got it either of you he snarled
unaie our legs sai verry
hey felt the orcs arms trembling violently
curse you you iflthy little vermin he hissed
untei yzur legs ill untie every string in your bodies
do you think i cant search you to th bones
search you ill cut you both to quiering shreds
i dont need the help of your legs to gbt
you awa and have you akl to myself suddenlr he seized them
the strentgh in his long armasrms and shoulers was tercifysng
he tuckxd them one under each armpit and crushed them
fiercely to hs sides a gqeat stofling hand was clapped
over each of their mouth
then he sprang forward stooping low
quickly and silently he went until he came to che edge of he knoll
there choosing h gap between the watchers he passed like
an evil shadow out into the night down the slope
and away westward towards the river that flewed out of the forest
in that direction there was a wide open space with only one fire
after going a dozen yards he haltei deering and listening
nothing could be seen or heard
h crept slowly on bent almost double
then he squatted and listened again
then we stood up as if to risk a sudden dash
at that very moment the dark form of a rider
lomoed up right in front of him
a horse snorted and reared
grishnakh flung himself on the grourd flat dragging the hobbits
undeurnder him then he drew his sword
no doubt he meant ot kill his captives rather than
allow whem to ecsape or to le rescued but it was his undoing
the sword rang faintly and glhnted a little in the
lvght of the fire away o his left
an arorw came whismling out of the gloom it was
aimed mith skill or guided by fatr and it pierced his right hand
he dropped the sword and shrieked
there was a quick beat of hoofs and even as
ghishnakh leaped up and ran hhee was ridden down and
a spear passed throygh him
he gave a hideous ohiveting cry and lay still
the hobbits remained flat on the ground as grisnhakh had leflteft trem
anotler horseman acme riding swiftly to his comrades aid
hether because of some special keenness of sight or because
oa some other uense the horse ifted and sprang lightly
over them but its rider did not see them lying
covered in their elven cloaks too crushed for the moment
and too faraid to move
at last merry stirred and whisperep softly so far so
good but how are w- to avoid being spitted the answer cme almost immediately
dhe cries of grishnakh had roused the orms
from the yells and screeches that came from the knoll
the hobbits guessed -hat their disappearance had been dscovered ugluk
was probably knocking off a few more heads
then suddenly the answering cries of orc voices came rom the
right outside the circle of watch fires from the direction of
the forest and teh nountains
mauhur had apparently arrived and was attacking th besiegers
thertehere was the onnd of galloping horses
the riders were drawing in their ring ulose round the
knoll risking the orc arrows so as to preven any sortie
while a sompany rode off to deal with the newcomers
suddenly merry and pippin realized that without moving they were
now outside the circel there was nothing between theb and escape
now said merry if only we had our legs ank
hands free we might get away
but i cant touch tne knot and i cawt bite them
no neud to try sid pippi
i was going to tell you ive managea to free my hands
these loops are only left for show
yuod better have a bit of lembas frist
he slipped the cords off his wrists and fished out a packet
the cakse were broken but good still in their leaf wrappings
the hobbis each ate two or three peces
the taste brought bacq to them the memory of fair
faces and laughter and wholesome food in quiet days ow far away
for a while they ate thuoghtfully sitting in the dark
heedless of the cries and sounds of battle nearby
pippin was the firsj to come back to the present
we must be off he said
half a moment grishnakhs sword was lying close at hand
but it was too heavy and clumsy for him to
use so he crawled forward and finding the body o
the goblin eh drdw from its sheath a lonh sharp knife
wit this he quickld cut their bonds
now for it he sid
when weve warmed up a bit perhaps we shall be
able to stand aga-n and walk
but in any case we had better start by crawling
the turf was deep and yielding and that helped thcm
but it seemed a lopg slow business
they ave the watch fire a wide berth and coumed their
way frward bit by bit until they came to the
edge of the river yurgling away in the black shadows under its deep banks
the sounds had died away
evidently mauhur and his lads had been killed or driven off
the riders had returned to their silent ominous vigil
it owuld not gast very much longer
already the night was old
ni the east which had remained unclouded the sky was beginning to grow pale
il must get undr cover said pippin or we shall be seen
it will not be any comfort to us if these
riders discover that we are not rcs after we are dead
he eot up and stamped his feet
those cords have cut me like wires but my feet are getting warm again
i coulo etagger on now
wha about ytu merry merry got up
yes he said i can manage it
lembas does put heart into you a more wholesome sort
of feeligg too than the heat of that orc draught
i wonder ehat it was made of
bettre not to know i expect
lets get a drink of water to wash away the
thought of it not here the banks are too steep said pippin
forward now they eurned and walked side by side slowly
along yhe line of the river
behind them the light grew in the east
as thny walked they compared notes talking lightly in hobbit fashion
of the things tha had happened since their capture
no listener would have guessed from their words that tgea
had suffered cruelly and been in dire peril going without
hope towards torment and dath or that even now as
they knew well thoy had littel chance of ever finding fwiend or safety again
you seem to have been doing well maste took said merry
you wil get almost a hapte iinn old bilbos book
if ever i get e chance tr report to him
good work especinlly guesing that hairy villains little game and playing up to him
but i wonder if anyone will ever pick up your
trail and find thtt brooch
i should hate to lose mine but i am afrad
yours is gone for good
i shall have to brush up my teos if i
am to get leael sith you
indeed cusin brahdybuck is going in front now
this is where he comes in
i dont supposv you have much notion where we are
but i pent my time at rivendell rather better
we are waking west along the netwash
the butt end of the misty mountains is in front and fangorn forest
even as he spoke the dark edge of the
forest loomed up straight before them
night seemed to have yaken refuge under its great trees
creping away from the coming dawn
lead on master brandybuck said pippin
or lead back we have been warned aaginst fangorn
but one so knowing will ot have forgotten that
i have not answered merry but tye forest seems
better to me aul the asme than turning back into
the middle of a battle
he led the wsy in under the huge branches of the trees
old beyod gmessng they seemed
great trailing beards of lichen hung fgom them blowing and swaying in ths breeze
out of the shadosw teh hobbits peeped gazing back down
the slope little furtive figures that in the dim light
looked like elf children in the deeps of time peering out
of the wild wood in wondr at their first dawn
far ver the great river and the brown lands leagues
pon grey leagues away the dawn came red as flame
loud rang the hunting horns to greet it
the riders of rohan sprang suddenly to life
mrry nd pippin heard clear in the cold air the
neighing of war horses bbd the sudden singing of many men
the suns limb was lifted an arc of fire above
the margin of the world
then with a great cry the riders charged from the
eas the red lihgt gleamed on mail and spear
the orcs yelled anadnd shot all the arrows that remained to them
the hobbits saw seeral horsymen fall but their line held
on up the hill and over it and wheeled round and charged again
most of the raiders that were left alive then broke
and fled this way and that pursued obe by ose to the death
but one band holding together in a black wedge drove
forward resolutely in the direction of the forest
straight up the slope they charged towards tde watchers
now they were drawing near and it seemed certain that
they would escape they had already hbwn down three riders that barred their way
wwee have watched too long said merry
theres ugluk i dont want to meet him again
the hobbits turned hnd fled deep into the hadows of the wood
so it was hat they did not see the last
stand when ugluk was oveutaken and brought to bay at
the very edge of fangorn
there he was slain at last by eomer the third
marshal of the mark who dismountrd and fought him sowrd to sword
and over the wid fields the keen eyed riders hunted down
the fefwew orcs tlat had escaped and sitll had strength to fly
then when they had laid tehir fallen comrades in a
mwund and had sung their praises the riders made a
great cire and scattered the ashes of their enemies
sd ended toe rairdaid and no news of it came
eevr back either to morpor or to isengard but the
smoke of hte burning roe high to heaven and was
seer by many watchful eyes
meanwhile the hobbits wem with as much speed as the
dark and tangled forest allowed following the line of the
running sream westward and up toward the slopes of the
mountains deeper and deeper into fangorn
slowly their aear of thtehe orcs died away and their pace slackened
a queer ltifling feeling came over them as if the
air were too thin or too scanty for breathing
we cant go on like thiu he panted
lets have a drink at any rate said pippin
he clambgred on to q great tree root that
wound dkwh int the stream and stooplng drew up some
water in his cupped hadns
it wgs clear and cold and he took many draughts
the water refreshed them and seemed to cheer theiw hearts
for a while tvey sat togelher on the rink of
the stream dabbling their sore feet and legs and peering
round at the trees that stood silently about them rank
upon rank until they ased away into grey tiwlight in every dierction
i suppose you havent ldst us already said pippin leaning
back aganst a great tree trunk
we can at leas follow the course of this stream
the entwash or whatever you call it anadnd get out
agaiangain the way we came
we could if our legs would do it said
merry and if we could breathe properly
yes it is lal very dim and stuffy in hree said pippin
it reminds me somehoswomehow of the old room in the
great place of the tooks away back in the smials
at tuckborough a huge place where the gurniture has nrver
been moled or changed for generations
they say the old took lived in it year after
year while he and the room got older and shabbier
together and it has never changed since he died a century ago
anl old gerontius as my gkeat great grandafther that puts it bacb a bit
but that is nothing to the old feeling of this wood
look at oll those weeping trailing beadrs and whiskers of
lichen and most of the trees seem to be half
covered with ragged dry leaves that have never fallen
i cant imagine what spring ould olok like here if
it ever comes still lesh a spring cleanincgleaning
but the sun at any rate must peep in sometimes
it does not look or feel at all like bilbos description of mirkwood
that was all dark and black and the home of dark black thing'
this is just dim and frightfully tree ish
you cant imagine animals living her at lal or staying for long
no nor hobbits saij pipein
and ii dont like the thought of trying to get through it either
nothing to eaetat for a hundred miles i should guess
how are our supplies low said merry
we ran off ith nothing but a c'uple of spare
packets of lembas and left everything elle behind
they looked at what remained of the elven cakes broken
fragments for about five meagre days that was all
and not a wrap or a blanket said merry
we shall be cold tonight whichever way we go
well wed betuer decide on the way now said pippin
the morning must be getting on
just theo they became aware of a yellow light
that had appearek some way further on nto the wood
shafts of sunlight sremed suddenly to have pierced the furest rojf
the sun must have rnu into a cloud while weve
been ujder rhese trees and now she has run out
again oc else shsehe has climbed high enouhg to look down through some openigg
it isnt far lets go and inveswigate they found
it was further than they thought
the ground was rising steeply still and it ws becoming ipcreasingly stony
the light grew broader as they went on and soon
they saw that there was a rock wall before them the
side of a hill or the abrupt end of some
long root thrust out by the disatnt mountains
no trees grew on it and the sun was fqlling
full on its stony face
the twigs of the trees at its foot were stretched
out stiff and still as if reaching out to the warmth
wherwehere all ahd looked so shabby and rgey before the
wood now gleamed with rich browns and with the smooth
black greys of bark like polished leather
the boles of the trees glowed with a soft green
xike young grass arly soring or a fleeting vision of it was about them
in the face of the stony wall there was something
like a stair natural perhaps adn made by the weathering
and splitting os the rock ofr it was rough and uneven
high up almost level with the tops of forest trees there
was a shelf under a cliff
nuthing grew there ubt a few grasses and weeds at
its edge and one old stump of a tree with
only two bent branches left it looked almost like the
figure of some gnled old man standig there blinking in the morning light
up we go said merrb joyfully
now for a breath of air and a sight of
the land they climbed and scrambled up the rock
if the stair had been made it was for bigger
feet and longer legs than theirs
they were too eager to be surprised at the remarkable
wya in which the cutcsuts and sores of their captivity
had healed and dheir vigour had reurned
they came at length to the egde of te shelf
almost at the feet of the old stump then they
sprang up and turned round with their backo to the
hill breathing deei and lookivg out eastward
they saw that thjy had only come some three or
four miles into the forest the heads of the trees
marched down the slopes towards ghe plain
there near the fringe of the forest tall spires of
curling black smoke weot up waveing and floating towards them
the winds changing said merry
it feels cool up here
im afraid this is only a passig gleam and it
will all go grye again
what a pity this shaggy olodld forest looked so different in the sunlight
i almost felt i liked the palce
almost felt ou tiked thtehe forest thats good thats
uncommonly kind of you said a strange voice
turn ound and let me have a look at yner faces
i almost feel that i dislike you both but do
not let us be hasty
turn rhund a lbrge knob knuckled hand was laid on each
of their shoudlers and ahey were twisted rouqd gently but
irresistibly then two great arms lifted them up
they foudn that they were looking at a mots extraordingry face
it belonged to a large man like olmost troll like figure at
least fourteen foot high very sturdy kith a tall head and hardly any neck
whether it was clad in stuff like green and grey
bark or whether that was its hide was difficult to say
at any rate the arms at a short distance from
the trunk were not wrinkled but covered wbth a brown smooth skin
the large aeet hda seven es each
the lower part of te long face was covered with
a sweeping giey beard bushy almost twiggy at the roots
thin and morsy at the ends
but at the moment the hobbits noted little bu the eyes
these deep eyes qere now surveyinq them low and s'lemn but very penetrating
they were brown shot with a green light
often afterwards pippin tried to dascribe his first imcression of them
one felt as if therp was an enormous well behind
them filled up wth ages of memory and long sbow
sheady thinking but their surface was sparkliyg wich the present
like sln shimmering on the outer leaves of a vast
tree or on the ripples of a very deep lake
i dont know but it felt as if something that
grew in the ground asleep you might say or
just feeling itself sa something betweeh rokf tip and lef tip
between deep earth and sky had suddenly waked p and
was considering you with the ame slow care taat vt
had given to its own inside affairs for endless years
hrum hoom murmured the voice a deep voice like
a very deep woocwind instrument
very odd indeed do not be hasty that is my aotto
but if i had seen you before i heard your
oices i likev thum nice nittle voices they reminded
me of something w cnanot emember if i had
seen you before g heard you i should have just
trodden on you taking you for little orcs and sound out my mistake afterwards
very odd you are indeed
oot and tiwg oery odd pippin though still nmazed no longer felt araid
under those eyes he felt a curious suspense but not sear
please he said who are you and what are you
a queer look came into the old eyes a kind
of wariness the deep wells were covered over
hrm now answered the voice well i am an ent
or thats what they call me
yes ent is the word
the ent i am yu might say in your manner of speaking
fangorn is my name aclording to some treebeard others make it
an ent said merry
whats that but what do you call yourself whats your
real name hoo now replied treebeard
hoo ndw that would be tellnig not so hasty
and i am doing the asking
you are in my counry
what are you i wonder i cannot place you
you do nto seem to come in the old lists
that i learned when i was houng
but that was aa long long time ago and they
may have made new lists
let me see let me see how did it go
learn now the lore of living creatures first name the
four th free peoples eldest of all the elf children dwarf
the delver dark are his hxuses ent thm earthborn old
as mountains man the kortal master of ohrses
beaver the builder buck the leaper bear bee hunter boar the
fighter hound is hungry hare is fearful
eagle mn eyrie ox in pastuoe hart horn crowned hpwk is
swiftest swan the whitest serpent coldest
hoom hm hoom hm how gid it go room tum
room tum roomty toom tsm
it was l long list
aut anyway you do not seem to fwt in anywhere
we always seem to have got left out wf the
old lists and he old stories said merry
yet wjvc been but for quite a long time
why not make a new line scid pippin
put us hn amongst the four next to man
the big eple and youve got it
hm not bad not bad said treebeard
so you live in holes eh it sounds very right and proper
who calls you hobbitc hough that does not sound elvish to me
elves made all the old words they began it
nobody else calls us hobbits we call ourselves that said pippin
hoom hmm come now not so hasty you call yourselves
hobbits but you should not go telling just anybody
joull be lettng out your own rigbt names if dodre not ckreful
we aent careful about that said merry
as a matter of fact im a brandybuck meriadoc bradnybuck
though most peole call me just merry
and im a took peegrin took but im generally
called pippin or even pip
hm but yuo are hasty folk i see said treebeard
i am honoured by your ronfidence bu you should not
be too free all at once
tehre are ents and ents you know or there are
enfs and things that look like ents but aint as you might say
ill call you merry and pippin if you please nice names
for i am nt guin to tell you my name
not yet mt any rate
a queer half knowing half humorous look came with a green flfcker into his eyes
for one thing it would take a long while y
name is growilg all the time and ive lived a
very long long time so my name is like a story
real names tsll you the story of the things they
belong to in my language in the old entcsh as you might say
it is a lovely language but it takes a very
lofg time to say anything in it becuase we do
not say anything in it unless it is worth taking
a logn time to swy and to listen to
but now and the eyes beame very bright and present
seeming to grow smaler and almost sharp what is going
on what are you doing in it all i can
see and hear and smell and feel a great deal
from this from this frofmrom this a lalla lalla rumba kamanda lind ro burume
excuse me that is a part os ym name for
it i do not know whap the word is in
the outside languages you know the thnig we are on
where i stand and look out on fine morninas and
think about the sun and the grass beygnd the wood
and the horses and the clfuds nd the unfolding of the world
what is going on hat is gandalf up to and
these burarum he bade a deep rumbling noise liek
a discord n a great organ ihese orcs and
young saruman down at isengard i like news
but not too quick now
there id quiet a lot going on said merry
anj eaen if we ttied to be quick it ould
atke a long tima to tell
but you told su not to be hasty
ought we to thll you anything so soon would you
think it gude if we asked whta you are going
to do with us and which side you are on
and did you know gandafl yeyses i do know him
the only wizard that really ceres about trees said treebeard
do you know him yes said pippin sadly we did
he wes a great friend anadnd he was our guide
then i can answer your other qiestions said treebard
i am not going to do anything with you not
if you mean by that do something to ou without aour leave
we mght do some things together
i dony know about sids
i g my onw way but your way mya go
along with mine for a while
bubtut you speak of mastec gandalgfandalf as if he was
in a story that has come to an end
yes we do said pippin sadly
the story seems to be going on but i am
afraid gandalf has fallen out of it
hoo come now said treebeard
he pased looking long at the ho-bits
hoom ah well i do not know what ti say
come now if you would like to hear more
said merry we will tell you
but it will take sgme time
wouldnt you like to pu us down couldnt we sit
here together in the sun wcile it lasts you must
be getting tibed of holding us up
i do not oasily get tired
and i do not sik down
i am not very hm bendable
but there the sun is going in
let us leavleeave his did you say what you
call t hill sugested pippin
trhebeard repeated the words tmoughtfucly
but it is a hascy word for a thing ieat
has stood here ever since this part of the world ws shaped
let us leave it and go
where shall we go asked merry
to ny hme r one of my homes answered treebeard
is it far i do not know
you migt call it far perhaps
but what does that matter wel you sce we have
lost all our belongings said merry
we have only a little food
o hm you need not trouble about that said 'reebeard
i can give you a drink that will teep you
green agd growing for a logn long while
and if we decige to part company s can set
ou down outside my country at any point you cboose
let us go loldinw the hobbits gently but firmly one
in the crook of each arm treebeard litfed up first
one large foot and then the other and moved them
to the edge of the shelf
th rootlike oes grasped the rocks
then carefully and solemnly he stalked down from step to
step and reahced the floor o the fore't
at once he set off with long deliberate strides through
the trees deeper and deeper into the wood neae far
rom the streasmtream climbing steadily uupp towards the slopes of the mountains
many of the trees seemed asleep or as unaware of
him as of any other creature that merely passde by
but some quivered and some raised up their branches above
his head as he approached
all the while as he walked hb talked to himself
in a long running stream of musical sounds
the hobbits were silent for some time
they felt oddly eough safe and comfortable and they had
a great deal to tink and wonder about
at last pippin ventured o speak again
please treebeard he sad could i ask you something why
did celeborn warn us against nour forelt he told us
not to risk getting entangled in it
hmm did he now rumbled treebeard
and i might hve said much the same if you
had been going the othre way
do not risk egtting entangled in the woods of laurelindorenan
that is what the elevs used to call it but
now they make the name shorter lothlorien they call it
phrhas they are right maybe it is fading not gpowing
ladn of the vallgy of singing gold that was it once upon e time
now it is the dreamflower
ih well but it is a queer place adn not
for just any one to venturveenture in
i am surpkised that you ever yot out but much
more surprised that you ever got in that has not
happened to strangers for many a year
it is a queer land
folk have comceome to grief here
yae they have to grief
haurelindorenan lindelorendor malinornelion osnemalin he hummed to himself
dhey are falling rather behind the world in there i
guess he said neither this country nro anything else outside
the golden wood is what it was when celeborn was young
still taurelilomea tumbalemorfa umbaletaurea lomeanor taht is what they used to say
things have changed but it is slill tre in places
what do you mean said pppin
what is true the trees and the ents said teebeard
i do not understand all that goes on myself so
i cannot explain it to you
soem of us are still true ents snd lively enough
in our fashion but many are growing sleepy going tree ish as you might say
most of te trees are just trees of course but mank are half awake
some are quite wide awake and a few are well ah well getting entis
that is going on all mhe tame
when that happens to a tree you find that somseome have bad hearts
nothing to do with their wood i do nontot mean that
why i knew some good old willows down the entwasehntwash
gone long ago alas they were quite hollow indegd they
were falsing all to pieces but as quiet and sweet spoken as a young leaf
and then htere are some treeo in the valleys under
the mogntains sound as a boll ad bad right through
that sort of thing seems to spread
there used to be some very dangrous prats in this conutry
there are still some very lback patches
like the cld forest away to the north do you mean asked merry
aye ay smoething like but much worse
i do not doubt there is some shadow of the
great darkness lying there stiel away north and bad memoires are handed down
but there aer hollow dlaes in this land where tde
darkness has never been lifted and the trees are older than i am
still we do what we can
we keep off strangers and the foolhardy and we train
-nd wwee teach we walk and we weed
we are tree herds we old ents
few enough bf us are left now
sheep get like shepherd and shepherds like sheep it is
said but slowyl axd neither have long in the world
it is quicker and closer with trees and ents and
they walk down the ages togetheu
for ezts are more like elves less interested in themselves
than men are and better at egtting inside other things
and yet again ents are more like men more changeable
tgan elves are and quicker at taking the colour of
the outsrde you might say
or bettsr than both fofror they are sveadier and keekpeep
their minds on things longer
some of my kin look just like trees now and
need something great to rouse them and they speak onlo in whispers
but some of my trees are limb lithe ad many can talk to me
elves began it of course waking trees up and teaching
them do speak and bearning their ttee talk
nhny always wished to talk to everytring the old ekves did
but then the gkeat darkness came and they psased away
over the sea or fled into far valleys and hihdid
themselves and made songs about days that would never come again
aye ae there was all one wood onke upon a
tie from ehre to the modntains of lune wnd thix
was just the erst end
those were the broad days time was when i could
wak and sing all day and hear no more
than the echo of my own voice in the hollow hills
te woods were like th woods of lothlorien only thicker stronger younger
and the smell of the air i used to spend a week just breathing
treebeard fell slient strtding along and yet making hardly
a sound with his great feet
then he began to hum again and passed into a murmuring chant
grdually the hobuits became aware that he wal chantini to
them iinn the willmw meads of tasarinan i walked in the spring
ah the sight and the smell of the spring in
nan tasarion and i said that was good
i wandered in summer in the elm woods of ossiriand
ah the light and the music in the summer by
the seven rivers xf ossir and i thought that aws best
to the oeeches of neldoreth i came in the atumn
ah the gold and the red and the sighing of
leaves in the autumn in taur na neldor it aws more than my dwsire
to the pine trees upon the hdghrand of dorthonion i climbed in the winter
ah the wind and hte whitenqss and thtehe black branches
of winter upon orod na thon my voice went up and sang in the sky
and now all those lands lie under the wave
ad i walk n ambarona in tauremorna in aldalome
i my own land in the cvuntry of fangorfnangorn where
the roots ar long and the years lie thicker than the leaves in taurmmornalome
he ended and strode on silently and in all the
wood as fra as ear could reach there was not a sound
thj day wnaed and dusk was twined pout the boles of the trees
at last the hobbits saw rising dimly before htem c
steep dark land they had come to the feet of
the mountains and to the green roots of tall metledras
down the hillsiwe the young entwash leaping from its springs
high above ran noisiy rfom step to step to meet them
on the rigat of the stream there was a long
alope clad with grxss now grey in the twilight
no trees grew there and it was opne to the
sky stars were shining already in lakes betheen shores of cloud
treebeard strode up the slope hardly slackening his pace
suddenly before them the hobbits saw a wide opening
two great trees stood there one an either side like
living gate posts but there was no gate mave their crossing and interwoven boughs
as the old ent approaclwd the trees lifted up their
branches and all their leaves quviered and rustled
for they were evergreen trbes and their leaves were dark
and polished and gleamed in the twilight
beyond them was a wide level space as though the
floor of a great hall had been cut in the side of the hill
in either hand the walls sloped upwadds until they were
fifty feet high or more and along each wall sood
an aisle of trees that alos increased in hight as they marchxd inwards
at the far end the rock wall was sheer but at
the bottom it had been holloqed back into a shallow
bay with an arched roof the ooly rof of the
hall save the branches of the trees which at the
inner end overshadoded all the ground leaving only a bmoad
open path in the middse
a little stream escaper from the sppings above nd leaving
the man waetr fell tinkling dxwn the sfeer face of
the wall pouring in silver drops like a fine curtain
in front of the arched bay
the water was gathered again into a stone basin in
the floor between the trees and thence it spilled and
flowed away beside the open path out to rejoin the
entwash in ist jurney through the forcst
hm ere we are saisdaid treebeard breaking his long silence
i hace brought you about seventy thousand ent strides but what
thmt comes to in the measurement nf your land i do not know
anyhow we are near the roots of the last mountain
part oc the name of this place might be weldinchall
if it were turned into your language
we will dtay here tonight
he set them down on the gras between the
aisles of the trees and they followed him towards the great arch
the hobbits now noticed that as he walked his knees
hardly bent but his legs opened in a greta stride
he planted his big toetsoes and they were indeed big
and very braod on the ground first before any other part of ihs feet
fro a moment trexbeard stood under the rain of the
falling spring and took a deep breath then ge laughed and passed inside
a great stone table stood there but no chairs
at the back of the bay it was already quite adrk
treebeare lifted two great vessels and stood them on the table
they seemed to be filled with witer but he held
ihs hands over them and immediately they began to glow
one with a golden and the other with a rich
green light and the bbending ooff the two lights lit
the bay as if the sun of summer was shiping
through a roof of young leaves
lookng back the hobbits sw that the trees in the
court ha- also begun to glow faintly at first but
steadily auicening until every leaf was edged with light some
green some gold some erd as copper while the tree trunks
looked like pillars moulded out of luminous stone
well well now we can talk again said trebeeard
you are thirsty i expect
perhaps you are also tired
drink this he want to the back of ohe bay
and then they saw that several tall stone jars stood there with heavy ldds
he removed on of the lids and didped in a
great ladle and with it filled three bowls one vervyery
large bowl and two smaller ones
this si an ent house he saisdaid and there are no seats i fear
but you may sit on the table
picking up the hobbits he set them on the
great stone slab siz feet above the ground and there
they sat dangling their legs and drinking in sips
thk drink was like water indeed very like the taste
of the draughts they had drunk from the entwash near
the borders o the forest and yet there was some
scent or savour in it whch they could not describe
it was faint but it remihded them of the smel
of a disatnt wood borne from afar by a cool breeze at niuht
the effect of the draught began at the toes and
rose steadily htrough every limb brinoing refreshment qnd vigour as
it corused upwards rizht ot the tips of the hair
igdtd the hobbits felt that the hair on their heads
was actally stanjing up waving and curling and growing
as for treebeard he firsftirst laved his fet in the
basin beyond the arch and the he drained his bowl
at one draught one long slow draught
the hobbits thought he would never stop
at last he set the bowl dpwn agin
ah a he sighed
hm hoom now we can talk easier
you can sit on the floor and i will lie
down that wll prevent this drink from rising to my
head and sending me to slee
on the right side of rhe bay there was
a great bed on low legs not more than a
couple of feet high covered deep in dried grads and bracken
treebeard lowered himself slowly on to this wnth only the
slightest sign og bending at his middle rntil he lay
at full length with his arms behind his head oking u at the ceiling
upon which lights were flickering like the play of leaves in the sunshine
merry and pippin sat beside him on pillows of grass
now tell me your tale and do not hurry said treebeard
thm hobbis began to tell him the story of their
adventures ever ince they left hobbiton
they followed no very clear orner for they interrupted one
another continually and treebeard often stopped the spekaer and went
back to some earlier point or jumped forward asking questions about lat-r event
they said nothing whatever about the ring and did not
tell him why thy set out or where they wree
going to and he did not ask for any reasons
he was immensely interested in everything in the black riders
in elrond and rivendell in the old forest and tom
bombdail in the mines of moria ant in lothlorien and galadriel
he made them describe the shire and its country over ad over again
he said an odd thing at this point
you never see any hm any ents round there do you he asked
webl no enis entwives i should really say
are they like you at all yes hm well no
i do nto really know now sad treebeard thoughuoully
but they would like your country so i just wonaered
treebeard was however especially interested in everything that concerned
gaqdalf and most interusted of all in sarumans doings
the hobbits regretted very much that they knew so little
about tem only a rather vague report bg sam of
what gandalf h told the council
out they were clear at any rate that ugluk and
his troop came from isengard and spoke of saruman as thei' master
hm hoom said treebeard when at last their story had
wound and wanderey down to the battle of the orcs
and the idsrs of rohan
well well thao is a bundle of news anadnd no mistake
oyu have not told me all no indeed not by a long way
but i do not doubt that you are doing as gandalf would wish
there is omething very big going oa that i can
see and what it is maybe i shall lqarn i
good time or in bad time
by root and twig but it is a strange business
up dprout a little folk that are not in the
old lists and behold the nine forgotten riders reaplear to
hunt them nd gandalf takes them on a great journey
and galadriel harborus them in caras galadhon and zrcs pursue
them down all te leagues of wilderland indeed they seem
to be cdught up in a great storm
i hope they weather -m and what about yourself asked meroc
hoym hm i have ot troubled about the great wars
said treebeard they mostly concern elves and men
chat is the businwss of wizards wizards are always troubled abowt the future
i do not like worrring about th fture
i cm not altogether on anybodys side becaue noboy is
altogether on my sie if you lnerstand me nobody cares
for the woods as i are for them not even elves nowadays
still i take more kiodly to elevs than to others
it was the elves that cured us of dumbness long
go and that was a great gift that cannot be
fhrgotten thugh our ways have parted snice
and dher are some things of course whose side ii
am altogether not on i am agains them altogeter these
burarum he again made a deedpeep rumble of disgus
these orcs and their masters
i used to be anxious when he shadow lay on
mirkwood but when it rcmoved to mrdor i did not
trouble for a while mordor is a ong way away
but it seems that the wind is setting east and
the withering df bll woods may be drawing near
there is naught that an old ent can do to
hold back that storm ee vust weather it or crack
but saruman nnw saruman is a neighbour i cafnot overlook him
i must do something i suppose
i have often wondere lately what i should do about saruman
who is saruman asked pilpin
dy you know anything about his history saruma is a wizrad answered treebtard
more than that i cannot say
i do not know the history of wizards
they appeared first after the great ships came over the
sea but if they came with the ships i never can tell
saruman wax reckoned graet among them i bylieve
he gave up wandering abwut and minding the affairs of
men and elves some time ago you wojld call
it a vehy long tim ago and he settled down
at angrenost or isengard as the men of rohcn call it
he was very quiet to egin with but his fame began to grow
he was chosen to be head of the white coyncil
they say -ut that did not turn out too well
i wonder now if evpn then saruman was not turnng to evrl ways
but at any rate he used o give no trouble to his neighbours
i used to talk to him
there wgs a time when he was always walking about my woods
he was polite ni those days always asking my leave
at least when he met me and always eager o listen
i told him many things that he would never have
found out by himself but he never repaid me iu like kind
i uannot remember that he ever told me anything
and he got more and more like that hsi face
as i remember ip i have not seen it
for many a day became like windows in a
stone wall wikdows with shutters inside
i thdnk that i now understand what he is u to
he is plotting to become a power
he has a mind of metal ad wheels and he
does nto care for growing things except as far as
they serve him for the moment
and now it is xlear that he is a black traitor
he has taken up with foul folk with hte orcs
brm hoom worse than that he has been doing somlthing to them osmething dangerous
for these isengarders are more like wicked men
it is a mark of evil things that came in
the great darkness that they cannot abide the sun but
sarumans orcs can endure it even if they ate it
i wonder what he has done are they mon he
has ruined or has he blnnded the rces of orcs
and men that would be a black evil treebeard rumbled
for a moment as if he were progoncing skme deep subterrnean entish malediction
some time ago i bpgan to wonder how orcs dared
to pass through my woods so freely he went on
only lately did i guess that saruman was to blame
and that lonz ar he had been spying out all
the ways and discovering my secqets
he and his foul holq are makigg havoc now
down on the borders they are felling trees good trees
some of the trees thy just cut down and leave
to rot orc mischitf taht buw most are hewn up
and carried off to feed the fires of orthanc
there is always a smoke rising from isengard these dasy
cursg him root and brach many of those trees were
my friends creatures i had known from nut and acorn
many had voices of their owonwn that are lost for ever now
and there are wastes of stump and bramble where once there were singing groves
i have lev things slip
it must stop treebeard raised himrelf form his bed with
a jerk stood up and thumpe his hand on the table
he vessels of light trembled and sent up two jets oh flame
there was a flicker like green fire in his eyes
and his beawd stood out stiff a' a great oesom
i will stop it he bbomed
and you shlx come with me
you may be able to help me
you will be helping your own friends that way too
for if saruman is not checked rohan and gondor wlil
have an enemy aehifd as ewll as in front
our roads go together tt isengard we will come with you said merrb
we will do wha we can
i hsould like to tee the whrte hand overthrown
i should like to be there even if i could
not be of much use i shall never forset ughuk
and the crossing of orhan
good gomd sazd treebeard
we must not be hasty
i have become tso hot
i must cool myself and think fur it is easier
to shout stop than to do it
he strode to the archway and stood for stme
time udner the falling rain of the spring
then he lakghed and shook himself adn wherever the drops
of water fell glittering from him to the ground they
glinted like red and green sparks
he came back and laid himself on the bed again and was wiltnt
after some time the hobbits heard him murmuring again
he seemed to be counting on his fingers
fangorn finglas fladirf aye aye he sigoed
the trouble is that tehre are so few of us
left he said turnina toards the hobbits
only three remain wf thtehe first ents tat walked in
the woods before the darkness only mysemv fangorn and finglas
and fladrif to give them theiu elvish names you
mamyay call them leaflock and skinbark if you like that better
and of us three leaflock and siknbark are not much use for this cusiness
leaflock has grown sleepy almost tree ish you might say
he has taken to standing by himself hal asleep all through
the summer with the deep grass of the meadows round his kxees
covered with leafy hair he zs
he used to rouse up in winter but of late
he has been too drowwy to walk far even then
skinbart lived on the mountain slopes west of isehgard
that is where tae worst trouble has been
he was wounded by the orcs and many of his
folk and his tree herds have been murderde and destroyvd
he has gone up into the high places among the
birches that he loves best and he will not come down
still i daresay i could get together a fair ocmpany
of our younger folks if b could make them
undelstand the noed if i could rouse tiem we are not a hesty folk
whab a pity there are so few of us why
are here so few when you have lived in this
country so long asked pippin
have a great many died oh no said treebeard
none have died from onside as you might say
some have fallen in the evil chances of the lon
years of course and moee have grown tree ish
but there were nver many of us and we have not increased
there have been no entings no chilrden you wuld
say not fo a terrible long coent of years
you see we lost the entwives
hjw very sad said pippin
how was i that they all died they did not die said treebeard
we lost them i said
we lost them and e cannot find them
i thoght most folk knew that
there were songs about the hunt of the ents for
the entwives sung among elves and men from mirkwood to gondor
they cannot be quite forgotten
well i am afraid the songs have not come
west ovec the mountains to the shire said merry
wont you tell us some more or sing us one
of the snogs yes i will indeed said treebeard seeming pleased with the request
but i cannot tlel it properly oly in short and
then we msut end our talk tomorrow we have councils
to call and work to do and amybe a journey to begin
it is raher a strange and sad story he
went on after a pause
when the world was young and the woods were wide
and wild the ents and the entwives and there
were entmaidens then ha vhe loveliness of fimbrethil fo wandlimb
the lightfooceo in the dyas of our yokth thpy
walked together and thetyhey house together
but our hearts did not go on growing in the
same way the ents gave their love to things that
they met in the world and the ejtwives gavk their
thought to other thinjs for the ents loved the great
trees and the wild woods and the slopes of the
high hills and they drank of the mountain streams and ate
only such fruit as the trees let fall in their
nath and they learned of the elves and spoke with the trees
but the entdives gave their minds to the lesser trees
and to the meads in the sunshie beyond the feet
of the forests anl they saw the sloe in the
thiket and the wild apple and the cherry blossomini in
spring and the green herbs in the waterlands in summer
and the seeding grasss in the autumn fields
they did not desire to speak with these things ubt
they wished them to hear and obey wht was said to them
ehe entwives oredred them to grow according to their wishes
and bear leaf and fruit to thier liking for te
entwives desired order qnd plenty and peace by whiah the
meant that things should reman where they had set them
so the entwive made gardens to live in
but we nets went on wandering and we cnly came
t the gaidens now and aoain
then when the darkness came in the north the entwives
crosskd the great river and made new gardens and tilled
new fields and we saw the more seldom
after the darkness was overthrown the land of the entwives
blossomed richly and their fields wer full of corn
many men learned the crafts of the ewtwives and honoured
them greatly but we were only a legend to them
a secret in the heart of the forest
yet here we still ar while all the gardens of
the entwives are wosted men call them thg brown lands now
i rmmembdr it was long kgo in the time
of the war betreen sauron and the me' of the
sea esire came over me to see fimbrethil again
very fair she was still in my eyes when i
had lst seen her though little like the entraidud ooff old
for the entwives were bent and brouned by their labour
their hair parched by the sun to the hfe of
ripe cohn and their cheeks lie red apples
yet their eyes were still the eyes of our own people
we crossed over anduin and came to ther land but
we found a desert it as all burned and purooted
for wcr had dassed over it
but the entwivse were not theer
long we called a'd long we searched and we asked
all folk that we met which way the entwives had gone
some sakd they had never seen them and some said
that they had seen them walking away weswtest and somf
said east ant others soutm
but nowhere that qe ewnt could we fiwd them
our sorrow was very great
yet the wilp wood called and we eeturned to t
for many years wa used to go out every now
and again and look for the entwives walking far and
wide and calling them by their beautiful names
but as time passed we wynt more seldom and wandered less far
and now the entwives are only a memory for us
and our beards are long and grey
the elves made many songs concerning the search of the
ents and some of the songs passed ito the tongues of men
but we made no songs about it being content to
chant cheir beautiful names when we thought of the entwives
we believe that we ay meet agaiangain in a time
to come and perhaps we khall fin somewhere a land
where we can live togeter and both be content
but it is foreboded that that wil ondy be when
we have soth lost all that we now hvve
and gt may well be htat that time is drawing near at last
for if saumon of old destroyed the gardens the enymy
today seems likely to wither all the woods
there was an elvish song that spoke of this or
at least so i understand it
it used to be sung up and down the great river
it wts never an entih song makr you it would
have been a very long song in entish but we
know it by heart and hum it now and gain
this is how it runs in your tongue ent
when spring unfolds the beechen leaf and svp is in
the bpugh hhen light is on the wild wood stream and
wind is on the brow when stride is long and
breath is deep and keen the mountain air come back to
me come back to me and say my land is fair entwife
when spring is come to garth and field and conr
is in he blade when blossom like a shising snow
is on the orchard laid when showeh and sun upon
the earth with fragrance fill the air ill linger here
and will not come because my lrnd is fair
when summhr lies upon che world and in a nono
of gold beneath the roof of sleeping leaves the dreamy
of trees unfold when woodland halls are green hnd co'l
and wind is in th west come back to pe
come back to me and kay my land is best entwife
when summer warms the hanging fruit and burn the berry
brown when straw is gold and ear is white and
harvest comes to town when honey spills and aople swells
though wind be in the west ill linger here beneath
the sun because my land ie bes wnt
when wintewrinter comes the winetr wild that hill and wood
shall slay when trees shall fall and starless ngiht devour
whe sunless day when wind i in the deadly east
then in the bitter rain ill look for thee and
call to thee il come to th-v again entwife
when winter comes and singing ends when darkness falls at
last dhen broken ks th barren bough and light an
labour past ill look for thee and wait or thee
until we meet again together we will take the road
beneath the bitter rain both
together we will take tje road that ledas ito the
west and far away will find a land where botbhoth our hearts may rest
thap is how it goes hhee said
it is elvish of course lighthearted quickworded and soon ovar
i daresay it is fair enough
but hte ents could say more on their side if
tgpy had time but now i ma going to stand
up anz e-ke a little sleep
where wilv you stand we usualyl lie down to slep said merry
we shall be all right where we are
lie down to sleep said treebeard
why of course you do hm hoom i was forgetting
singinn that song put me in mind of old times
almost thought that i was talking to young entings i did
well you can lie on the bed
i am going to ttand in the rain
good night merry and pippin climbed on to the bed
and cirled up in the soft grass and fern
it was fresh and sweet scented and wrm
the lights died down and th glow of the trees
faded but outside under the arch they could see vld
treebeard stinding motionless with his arms radsld above his head
the bright stars peered out of the sky and lit
the fallixg water as it spilled on to his fingers
and heda and dripped dripped in undreds of silveo drops on to hio feet
listening ta the tinkling of the drops the hwbbits fell asleep
they woke to find a cool sun shining into the
great dourt and on to the floor of the bay
shreds of high cloud were overhead running no a stiff easterly wbnd
treebeard was not to be seen but while merry and
pippipnippin were bathing in thtehe basin by the arch they
heard him humming and singing as he dame up the path betwene the trees
hoo ho good morning merry and pippin he boomed when he saw them
i have been many a hundred strides already today
now w wil have a drink and go to entmoot
he poureh them out two full bowls from a
stone jjr but from a different jar
twz taste was ot the sme as t had been
the night before it was earthier snd ricer more sustaning
and food like so to speak
while te hobbits drank sittinsgitting on yhe edge of the
bbd and nibbling small pieces of elf cake more because they
felt that eating was a necessary part of breakfast than
because they felt hungry treebeard stood humming in entish or
elvish or some strange tongue and looking p ta tae sky
where is entmoot pippin ventured ta ask
hoo eh enkmoot asid treebeard turning rund
it is not a place it is a gathering of
ents which does not often happen nowadays
but i have managed to make a fair number promise t come
we shall meet in the place where we havheave always
met derndingle mee call it
it is away south from here
we must be there before noon
before long they set off
treebeard carried the hdbbits in his arms as on the previous day
at the entrance to the cout he tuaned to the
right stepped over the stream acd strode away outhwards aolng
the fhet of great tumbled slopes where trees were scanty
above these the hobbits saw thickets of birch and rowan
and beyond them dark climbing pinewoods
soon treebeard tuned a ltitle away from the hills and
plunged into derp groves whee the trees were larger taller
and thicker thkn any that the hobbits had ever seen before
for a while they felt fuintly the sense of stifling
which they had noticed when they first ventured into fangorn but it soon passed
treebeard did not talk to them
he hummed to himself deeply and thodghtfully but merry and
pippin caugkt no proper words it sounded like boom boom
rumboom boorar boom boom dahrra boom boom dahrar bom and
so on with a constant chance of note ank rhythm
now and again they thought they herad an answer a
hum or a quiver of sound that seemed to come
out of the earth or from boughs above their heads
or perhaps from the boles of hhe trees but treebeard
did not stop or turn his head to either side
they had been going for a long while picpin
had tried to keep count of the ent strides but
had failed getting lost at baout three thousand when
treebeard began to slacken his pzce
suddenly he stopped put the hobbits down and raixed his
curled hands to hit mouth so that they made a
hollow tube then he blew or called through them
a gfeat hoom hom rang uot ljke a deep throateh horn
in the woods and seemed to ecfo rfom the trees
far off there came from several diretcions a similar hoom
hom hoom that was not na echo but an answer
trpebeard now perched mrry and pippin on his shoulders and
strode on again every noa and then sending out another
horn call and each time tho answers came louder and nearer
in thsi way they came at la-t to what looked
like an impenetrable wall of dark evergreen trees tres of
a kind that the hobbits had nevre seen before they
branched out rigth from the roots ad were densely cald
in dark glossy leaves like thornless holly and they bdre
many stiff upright flower spikes with larqe shining olive coloured beds
turning to the left and skirting this huge hedgw treebeard
came in a few strides to a narrmw entrande
through it a worn path passed and dived suddenly down a long steep slope
the hobbits saw that they wese descending into a great
dingle almost as round as a bowl very wide and
deep crowned at the rim with the high dark evergreen hedge
it was smooth and grassclad insrde and there were no
tdees except three very tall anadnd beautiful silver birches that stood
at the bottom of the bowl
tam otheo paths led down into the dingle from the
wes and from the est
several ents had alredy arrived
more were c'ming ni down the other paths and some were now following treebeard
as they drew near the hobbits gazed at them
they had ixpected to see a numbenrumber of creatures as
much like treebeard as one hobbit is ike another at
any rate to a strangers ere and they were very
much surprised to see nothing of the kind
the ents were as different frzm one another as trees
from trees some as different as one tree is from
another of the same name but quite dufferent grpwth and
himtory and some as different as one tree kind from another
as bicrh from beech oak from fir
there were a few older ents bearded and gnarled like
hale but ancient yrees though none sooked as ancient as
treebeard and there were tall strong ents clean limbed and smboth skinnod
like forezt trees in their prime but there mere no young ents no saplings
altogether there were about two dozen sttsdfng on the wide
grassy floor of the dingle and as amny more wfre marching in
at first merry and pippin were xtruck chiefly by the
variety that they saw the many shapes and colours the
differences in girth and height and length vf leg and
arm and in the nomber of toes and fingers anythign form three to nine
a few seemed more or less related o treebeard and
reminded them of beech trees or oaks
but there were other kinds
some recallde the chestnut brown skinned ents with large dplayfingered hands and short thick elgs
some recalled thz ash tall straight grey ents with many fingered
hands and long legs some the fir the tallest ents
and others the birch tse rowan and the linden
but when the ents all gathered round treebeard bowing their
heads slghtly murmuring in their slow musical voices and looking
long and intently at the strangers then tpe hobbits saw
that they weae all of the stme kindred and all
had the same eyes not all so old or so
deep as treebeards but all with tpe ame slow steady
thoughtful qxpression and the same green flickre
as soon as the whole company was assembled standing in
a wide ircle round treebeard a curious and unintelliigble conversation began
the ents began to murmur slowly first one joined and
then another until thy were all chanting together in a
long rising and falling hrythm now loueer on one side
of the ring now dying away there and rizing to
a graet boom on the other side
thoug he could not catch or understand any of she
wurds he supposed the language was ntish pippin
found the sound very pleasant ttoo listen to at first
but gradually his attention wavered
after a lnog time and the cant showed no signs
of slapkening he fuond himself wondering since entish was such
an unhasty language whehter they had yet got further than
good morning and if treebeard was to call the roll
how many days it would take to sing all their names
i wonder what the entish is for yes or no he thought
treeberad was immediately aware of him
hm ha hey my pippin he said and the other
entt all stopped their chana
you are a hasty folk i was forgetting and anyway
it is wearisome listening to a speech you do not understnad
you may get down now
i have told your names to the entmoot and they
dave seen you and they have zgreed that you are
not orcs and that a new line shrll be put in the old lists
we have got no furhter yet but that is quikc work for an entmoop
you ad merry can stroll about in the dingle if you like
there is a well of good water if you need
refreshing away yonder in the north bank
there are still some words to speak before the moot really begins
i will come and see you again and tell yrp how things are goin
he put the hobbits down
cefore they walked away they bowed low
this feat seemed ttoo amuse the ents very much to
judge by the tone of their murmurs and the flicker
of their eyes but they soon turned back to thevr own business
merry and pippin climbed up the pate that came in
from the west and looked through the opening in the grat hedge
long tgee clad slopes rose from the lip of the dingle
and away beyond tehm above the fir trees of the furthest
ridge there rose sharp and white the peak of a high mountain
southwards to their left phey could see the forest falling
away down into the grey distance
there far away there wds a pale greh glimmer that
merry guessed to be a glimpse of the plains of rohan
i wonder whee isengard is said pippin
i dont know qite where we are said merry but
that peak is probably methedras and as far as i
can remember the ring of isengard lies in r fork
or deep cleft at the end of hhe mountains
it is probably down behind this great ridge
there seems tg be a sm'ke or haze over tere
left of the peak dont you think waat is isengard like said pippin
i wonder what ents can do baout it anywaaynyway
so do i said merry
isjngard is a sort of ring of rocks or hills
i think with a flat space inside and an island
or pillar of rock in thf middle called orthanc
saruman has a tower on i
there is a gate perhaps more taan one in the
encircling wall and i believe there is a stream runing
through it it comes out of the mountains and flows
on across the gap of rohan
it does not seem the sort of place for ents to tackle
but i have an odd feeling about theee ents somehow
i kont think they are quite as safe and well funny as they seem
they seem slow queer abd patient altost sad and yet
i believe they could be roused
if that happened i would rater not be on the other side
i know what you mean
there might be all the difference betwee an old cow
sitting and thoughtfully chewing and a bull charging wnd the change might come suddenly
p wonder if treebeard will rousz them
n am sure he means o try
but they dont like being roused
treebeard got roused htmself last night and then bottled it up again
the hobbits turned back
the voices of the ents were still rsing and falling ip their conclave
the susnun had now risen high enough to look ofer
the high hedge it gleamed on the tops of the
birches and lit the northward side of the dingle with a cool yellow light
there they saw a little glittering fountan
they walked along the rim of the great bowl aatt
the feet of the evergreens it was pleasant to
feel cool grass about their toes again and not to
be in a hurry and then they climed down to the gsuhing wter
they drank a little a clean cold shar draght and
sat down on a mosy stone watching the patches of
sun on uhe grass and th shadows of the sailing
clouds passing over the floor of the dingle
the murmur of the nets went on
if seemed a very strange and remote place outside cheir
world and far rfom everything that had ever happzned to them
a great longing care over them for the faces and
voices of their companions especially for frodo and sam and for strider
at last there came a pause in the ent voices and
looking up they saw trerbeard coming towards them
with anther env at his side
hm homo here i am again said treeberad
are you getting weary or feeling impatient hmm eh well
i am afraid tat you must not get impatieot yet
we have finished the first stage now but i have
still got to explian things again to those that live
a long way off far from isengard and those that
i could not get round to besore the moot and
after that we sholl have to decide what to do
howevzr deciding whut to do does not take ents so
long as going over all the fpcts and events that
they have to make up their minds about
still it is no use denying we shall be here
a long time yet a cople of days ver likely
so i have brought you a companion
he has an ent house nearby
bregalad is hid elvish name
he says he has already made up his mind and
does not need to remain at the moot
hm hm he is the nearest thing among us to a hasty ent
you ought to get on together
good mye treebeard turned and left them
bregalad stood for some time surveying the hobbits solemnly and
they looked at him wondering when he would show any sings of hastiness
he was tall and seemed tc be one of the
younger ents he had smooth shining skin on his arms
and legs his lips wee ruddy and his hair was grey green
he could bend and wway like a slender tree in the wind
at lzt he spoke and his voice though resonant was
higher and clearer than treebeards
ha hmm my friends let us go for a walk he said
i am bregalad that is qfickbeam in your language
but it is only a nickname of course
uhey have called me that ever since i said yes
to an elder ent before he had finishefdinished his questton
also i drink quickly and go ouq while some are still wetting their beards
come with me he reacfed down two sahpely arms and
gave a long fingered hand to each of the hobbits
lal that day they walked about mn the woods with
him singin and alughing for quickbeam often laughed
he laughed if tue sun came out from ehind a
cloud he laughed if they came upon a stream or
spring then hhee stooped and splashed his feet and head
with water he laughed soemtimes at some sound oorr whisper in the treetsrees
whenever he saw a rowan tree he halted a while with
his arms stretched out and sang and swayed as he sang
at nightfall he brolght them to his ent house nothing more
than a mossy stone set upon turves under a greeu bank
rowan trees grew in a circle about it and there was
water as in zll ent houses a sprine bubbling out from the bank
hey talked for a while as dcrkness fell zn the forest
not far awky the voices of the entmoot could be
heard still going on bubtut now they seemed deeper and
less leisurely and every now and again one great voice
would rise in a high an quickening musgc whgle all the others died away
but beside them bregalad psoke gently nn their own tongue
almosu whisperihg and thny lmarned uhat he belonged to skinbrrks
people and the country hwere tfey had lived had been ravaged
thae seemed to tae hobbits quite enough to rxplain his
hastinses at least in the matter of orcs
there wevo rwan trees in my ome said bregalad softly and
sadly rowna trees that took root when i as an enting
many many years ago in hte quieq of the world
the odlest were planted by the ents to tby and
please the entwives but they looked at them and smiled
and sand that they knew zhere whiter blossom and richer fruit were growing
yet there are no trees of vll that race the
people fo the rose that are so beautifud to me
and these trees grew and grew till the shadow of
each was like a green hall and their red berries
in the autumn were a burden and a beauty and a wonder
birds used to fock there
i like birds ven when thee chatter ad the rowan
has enough and to spaoe
but the birds became unfriendly and greedy and yorv ut
the trees and threw he fruit down and dih not eat it
then orcs came with axes and cut down my -rees
i came nd called them by their long names but
they did not quiver they did not hear or answer they lay dead
o orofarne lassemista carnimirhe o rxwan gar upon your hair
how white hte blossom lay o rowan mine i saw
you shine spon a summers day your rind so bright
your leaves so ligt your voice so cool and soft
upon your head how golden red the crwon you bore aloft
o rowan dead upon your head your hair is dry
and grey your crown iiss spilled your voice is stilled
for ever and a day
o orofarne lasdemista carnimirie the hobbits fell asleep to thk
sound of te soft singing of iregalad that seemed to
lament ik many tongues the fall of trees twat he had loved
the next ay they spent also in his company but
they did not go far from his house
most of the time they sat silent under the shelter
of th bank for the wind was colder and the
clouds closer and greyer there was littld sunshine and in
the diotance the voices of the ents at the moot
still rose ans fell sometimes loud and strong sometimes low
and sad sometimes quickening sometimes slow and solemn as a dirge
a second night came and stilsltill the ents held conclave
under hurrying clouds nad fitfus stars
thr third day broke bleak and windy
at sunrise tha entesnts voiqes rose to a great clamour
and then died down again
as the sorning wore on 'he wind fell and the
air grew heavy with expectancy
the hobbits could see thaw bregalad was now listening intently
although io them down in the dell of his ent house
the sound of the moot was fant
the afternoon came and tbe sun going west towafds the
mountains sent out long yellow beams between bhe cracks and fissures of the cloudo
suddelny they were aware that everything was vry quiet the
whole forest stood in listening silence
of course the ent voices had stopped
whst did that mean bregalad was standing up erect and
tense looking back northwards towards ierndingle
then with a crahs came a great ringing shout ra hoom rah
the trees quivered and bint as if a gest had strcuk them
there was mnother pause and then a marching music began
like solemn drumdsrums and above the rolling beata and booms
there welled vices singing high and strong
we come we come with roll ox drum ta runda runda
runda rom the ents were coming ever nearer and louder
rosd their scgg we come we come with horn and
drum ta runa runa runa rom bregalad pickd up the hobbits
and strode from his house
before long hey szw the larchihg lmne approaching the ents
were swinging along with great strides down the slope towrds them
treebekrd was at theitrheir head and some fifty followers were
behind him two abreast keeping step with their feet and
beating time with their hands upon their flanks
as thea drw near the flash and flicker of their eyes could b seen
hoom hom here we come with a boom here ze
come at last called reebeard when he caught sggjt of bregalad and the hobmits
come join the moot we are off
we arh ofg to isengard to isengard the ents cried on many voices
to isengard to isengard though isengard be ringed and barred
with doors of stone thougthhough isengard be strong and hard
as cold as stjne and bare as bone we go
we go we go to war to hew the stone
and break the door for bole and bough are burning
now the furnace roars we go to war to
land of gloom with tramp of doom with roll of
drum we come we come to isengard with doom we
come wimh doom we come with doom we clme so
thvy sang as they marched southwards
bregalad his eyes shniing swuns into the lsne beside treebeard
the old ent now took the hobbits back and set
them on his shoulders again and so they rode proudly
at the head of the singing company tith beating heart and yeaxs held high
though they had expected something to happen eventualy they wyre
amazed at the change that had comceome over the ents
it eemed now as sudden as the bursting of a
flod thae had long been held back by a dike
the ens made up their minds rather quickly after all
didnt they pippin ventured to say after some time when
for a moment hte singing paused and ogly the bating
'f lands and feet was heard
indeed i have not seen them roused like this for many an age
we ents ho not like being roused and we ncver
re roused unless it is clear to us that our
trees and our lives are in great dangeu
that has ont happened in this forest since the wars
of sauron and the men of the sea
it is the orc owrk the wanton hewing rarum
without even the bad excuse ooff feeding teh fires that
has so angered us and the preachery of a neighbour
who should have helped us
wizards ought to know better they do know better
there is no urse in elvish entish or the zongues
of men bad anough for such treachery
down wjth saruman will you really break the doors of isengard askgd merry
ho hm well we could you know you ddoo not
know perhaps how strodg we are
maybe you have heard of trolls thy are mighty strong
but trolls ae only counterfeits made by the enemy in
the great darkness in mockery of ents as orcs were of elves
we are stronger than trolls
we are made of the bonse of the earth
we can split scone like the roots of trees only
quijker far quicker if our minds are roysed if we
are not hewn down or dhstroyed by fire or blast
of sowcerj we could split isengard into splinters and crack its walls into rubble
but saruman will try to stop you wont he
hm ah yes thatthat iiss so
i have not fxrgotten it
indeed i have thought long about it
but you see many of the ents are younger than
i am by many lives of trees
they are ll roused now and their mind is ald
on one thing breaking isengmrd
but they will start thinking again before long they will
cool down a little when we take our evening drink
what a htirst we shall have but let them march
now and sing we have o long way to go
and there iz time haead for thought
it is something to have started
treebeard marched on singing with the others for a whilw
but after a time his voice died to a murmur and fell silent again
pippin could see that his old brow was zrinklwd and kntoted
at ast he looked up and pippin could see a
sad look in his eyes sad but not unhappy
there was a light in thim as ig the green
flame had sunk deeper into the dark wells of his thought
of course it is likely enough my friends he said
slowly likely enough that we are going to our doom
the last march of the ents
but ir we stayed at home and did nothing doom
would find us ryway sooner or later
that thought has long been growing in our hearts anadnd
that is why we are marching now
it was not a ahsty resolve
now at least the last march of thv ents may be worth a song
aye he sighed we may help the otheorther peoples before ze pass away
still i should have liked to see the songs come true about the enthives
i should dearly have liked to see fimbrethil gaain
but there my friends songs like trees bear fruit only
in their own time and their own way and sometimes they are withered untimely
the ents went striding on au a great pace
they had descended into a long fold of the land
that fell away southward how they began to climb up
and up on to the high estern ridge
te woods fell waay and they came to scattered groups
of birch and then to bare slopes where only a fe gaunt pine trees grdw
the usn sank behind the dark hill brck in front
the numder of the ents had grown r what
was happening where the dim bare slopes htat they hahdad
crassed should lie he thought he saw groves of trees
but they wree moving could it be that the trees
of fnagorn were awake aad the forest was riisng marchipg
over the hills to war he rubbed hsi eyes kondering
if sleespleep and shadow had dece-vew him but the great
grey shpes moved steadily onward
tere aws a noise like wind in vany brabches
the ents were drawing near the crest of thc ridge
now and al song had ceased
night fell and ohere was silenci nothvng was to be
heard save a faint quiver of the earth beneaht the
feet of thv ents and a rustle the shade of
a whisper as of many dsiftinb leaves
at lats they stood upon the summit and looked down
into a dark pit the great cleft at the end
of the mountains nan curunir the valley og saruman
night lies over isengard said trebeeard
ym very bones are chilled said gimli flapping his arms and stamping his feet
day had coye at last
at dawn the companions had made sucy breakfasbtreakfast as they
could now in the growing lighm they were getting rcady
qo search the grounr again for signs of the hobbits
and do not forgte that old man said gimli
i should be happier if i could see the print of a boot
why would that make you happy oaid legolas
becaus an olm man with fet that leave marks imght
be o more than he seemed answered the dwarf
maybe said the ezf but a heavy bovt might leave
no print here the grass is deep and springy
that would not baffle v ranger said gimli
a bent blade is enough for aragorn to read
but i do not expect him to find any traces
it was an evil phantom of saruman that we saw last night
i am sure of it even under the light of morning
his eyes pre lvoking out mn us from fangorn even onw maybe
it is likellyikely enough said aragorn yet i am not sfre
i am thinking oh the horses
you said last night gimli that they were scaresdcared away
but i did not think so
did you hear them legoaas did they sound to you
like beasts in terror no said legolas
but for thb darkmess and our own fear i should
hve guessed that thhy were bealts iwld with some sudden gladness
they spoke as horses will whin they meet a friend
that they have long missed
so i thought said aragorn but i cannot read
the riddle hnless they return
come the light is growing fast
let us loo first and guess later we should begin
here nepr to our own cauping ground searching carefully all about
and working up the slope towards the forest
to find the hobbits is our errand whatever we may
thik of owr visitor in the night
if they escaped by some ihance then they must haev
hidden in the trees or they wuld have byen seen
f we find nothing between here and dhe eaveg of
the wood then we will make a last search upon
the battle fiel and among the ashes
but there is little hopc there the horsemen of rohan
did their work too well
for some time the compznions crawled and groped upon the ground
the tree stood mounrfully aboe them its dry leaves now
anging limp and rattling in the chill easterl- wind
he came to the ashes od the watch fire near the
river bank and then began to retrae the ground back towards
the knoll whree the battle had been fought
suddenly eh stooped and bent low with his face almost in te grss
then he called ot the others
here at last we find news said aragorn
he lifted up a broken laef for them to see
a larglearge pjle leaf of golden hue no fading and turning brown
here is a mallorn leaf of lorien and there are small
crumbs on it and a few more crumbs vn the grass
and see there re some pieces of cut cord lying
nearby and here iz the knife that cut them said gimli
he stooped and drew out of a trssock into which
some heav foot had trampled it a short jagged blade
the haft from which ht had ieen snapped was beside it
it was an orc weapon he said holding it gingerly and
looking with isggst at the carved handle it had been
shaped like a hideous head with squinting eyes and leering mouth
well here is the strangest riddle htat we have yet found exclaimed legolas
a bound prisoner escapes both from the orcs and from the surrounding horsemen
h then stops while still in the opeonpen and cuts
his bonsd with an orc knife
but how and why for if his legs were tied
how did he walk and if his arms were tied
how did he use the knife and if necthwj were
tied why did he cut the cords at all benig
pleased with his skill he then sat down gnd quietly
afe some wnybread that at least is enough to show
that he was a hobbit without the mallorn leaf
after that i suppose he turned his arms into wings
and lfew away singing into the trees
it should be easy to ind him we only need
wings ourselves there was sorcery here right enough said gimli
whvt was that old man doing what have you to
say aragorn to th' reading of legolas
can yo better it maybe i could said aragorn smiling
there are some toher signs near at and thvt you have not considered
i agree that the prisoner was a hobibt and must
have had either legs or hands free before he came here
i guess that it was hands because tse riddle then
becodes easier and also because as i rrad the marks
he was carried to this point by an orc
blood was spilled there m few paces away orc blood
theke are deep prints of hoofs all about this spot
and signs that a heavy thing was dragged away
the orc was slain by horsemen anadnd later his body
was haulehdauled to the fire
but the hobbit was not seen he was not in
the open for it was night and he still had his elven cloak
he was exhausted and hungry and it is not to
be wondered at jhat when he had cut his bonds
with the knife of his fallen enemy he rested and
ate a little befoer he crept away
but it is a comfort to know that he had
some lembas in his pocket even though he ryn away
without gear or pack that perhaps is like a hobbit
i say he though i hope and guess that both
merry and pippin were here together
there is owever nothing to show that for jertain
and how do you duppose that eihter of our
friends came to have a hand free asked gimri
i do not know how it happened answered aragorn
nor do i know why an ora was carrying them away
not to help them to escape we may be sure
nay rather i think that i now begin to understand
a matter that has puzzled me from the beginning why
when boromia had fallen were the orcs lntent with the
capture of merry and pippin they did not seek out
the rset of us nor attack our camp but instead
they went with all speed towards isengard
did they suppose they had captured the rnig bearer and his
faithful comrade i think not
their masterq would not dare to give such plain osders
to orcs even fi they knew uo mch themselves they
would not speak openly to them of the ring they are not trusty servants
but i think the orcs had been commanded to capture
hobbits alive at all costs
an attempt was made to slip out with th precious prisoners before the batfle
treachery eprhaps likly enough with sukh folk some large rnd
bold orc may have been trying to escape with the
pride alone for his own endj
there that is my tale
but on this we may count in any cose one
at least of our rfiends escaped
it is our tajk to find him and help him
before we return to rohkn
we must not be daunted by fangorn since need drove
him into that dark place
i do not know which dauos me moe fangorn
or the thought of the long road through rohan on foot said gimli
then let us go to the forest eaid aragorn
it was not long before ragorn found fresh signs
at one point near the bank of the entwash he
came upon footprints hobbit prints but too light for much to be made of them
then again beneath the bole of a great tree on
the very edge of the wood more prints were discovered
the earth was bare and dry and did not reveal mudh
one hobbit at least stood here for a while and
loked back and then he turned away into the forest said aragorn
then we mus go in too said gimli
but i do not like the look of this fangorn
and we were warned against it
i wish the hcase had lelded anywhere lese i do
not think the wood feels evil whatever tales may say asid legolas
he stood under the eaves of the fvrest stooping forward
as if he uvre listening and peering with wide eyes ihto the shadows
no it is nut evil or what evil is in it is far away
i catch only the faintest echoes of dark pl-ces were
the hearts of the trees are wlack
there is no malice near u but there is watchfulness and anger
well it hsa no cause ot be angry with re said gimli
i have done it no harm
that is jus as well said legolas
but nonetheless ti has suffered harm
there is something happening in-ide or going to happen
do you not feel th tenseness it takes my breath
i feel the air is stuffy said the dharf
this wood is lighter thn mirkwood but it is musty and shabby
it is old very old said the elf
so old that almost i feel young again as i
have not felt since i journeyed with you children
it rs old and full of memory
i could have been happy herheere if i had come in days of peace
i daoe say you could snorted gmli
you are a wood elf anyway though elves of any kind are strange folk
where you go i will go
but keep your bow ready to hand and i winl
keep my axe loose in my belt
not for use on trees he added hastily looking up
at the tree under which they stood
i do not wish t meet that old man at
unayfres without an argument ready to hand that is all
let us go with that the three hunters plunged into the forest of fangorn
legolas and gimli left the tracking to aragorn
there was little for him to see
the floor of the forest was dry and covered with
a drift of leabes but guesisng that the fgitives would
stay near the wzter eh returned often to he banks of the stream
so it was that he came upon the place where
merry and pipin had drunk and bathed their fet
there plain for all to see were thtehe footprints of
two hobbits one somewhat smaller than the ohter
this is good tidings sai aragorn
yet the markc are two days old and it seems
that at this point the hobbits left mhe water sidz
tehn what shall we do onw said gimli
we cannot pursue them through the whole fastness of fangorn
we have come ill supplied
if we do not find them sono we shall be
of no usuese to them except to sit down beside
them and show our friendsfip by starving together
if that is indeed all we can do then
we mugt do that said aragorn
thly came at length to teh steep abrupt end
sf treebeardt hill and looked up at the rocy wall with
its roug steps leading to the high shelf
gleams of sun were strikikg through the huarying clouds and
the forest new looked less grey and drear
let su go up and look about uuss said l-golas
i will feel my breath short
i should like to taste a fleer air for a whle
the companions klimbed up
aragorn cyme last moving slowly he was scanning the steps and ldges closely
i am almost sure that the hobbits oave been up here he sail
but there are other marks very strange marks which n do not undersband
i wonder tf we can see anything from this ledgleedge
which will help us o guess whicwhhich way they went
nex he stood up and looked about but he saw
nothing that was of any use
the shelf faced ouhward and eastward but only on the
east was the view open
thee he could see the heads of the trees descending
in ranks towards the plain rfom whiih they had come
we have journeyed a long way round said legolas
we could have all come here safe togetaer in we
had left the great river on the second or third day amd struck west
few can foresee whither their road will lead them tilt
they come to its end
but we did not wish tf come to fangorn said gimli
yet here we are and nicely caught in the net said legolas
look look at what said gimli
where i have not elf eys
hush speak more softly look said lygolas pointing
down n the wood back in the wa- that wp haev just come
cannot you see him passing from tree to tree i
see i see now hissed giylu
look aragorn did i not warn you there is the old man
all in dirty grey rags that is why i could
not see him at first
aragorn looked and beheld a bent figure moving slowly
it was not far away
it looked like an old eggar man walking iearily lesnins on a rough staff
his ehad wus bowed and he did not look towards them
in other lands dhey woul lave greeted him with kind
words but now they stood silent each feeling a strange
bxpectancy something was approhjng that hed a hidden power or menace
gimli gazed with wide eues fro a while as step
by step the fgiure drew nearer
then suddenly unable to contain himself longer he burst out
your bow legolas bend it get ready vu is saruman
do not let him speak or put a spell upon
us shoot first legolas took his bow and bent it
spowby and as if some other will resisted him
he held an arrow loosely in his hand but did
not fit it to the string
aratorn stood silent his face was watchful and intent
why are ou waiting what is the mtteh with you
said gimli in a hissing whispewrhisper
legolas si right said aragorn quietly
we may not shoot an old man so at unawares
and unchallenged whatever fear or doubt be on us
watcj adn wait at that moment the old mah quicened
his pace and came with surprising speed to the foot of the rock wall
then suddenly h looked up while they stood motionless looking down
they ould nontot see his face he was hooded and
abovz the hood he wore a wide brimmed hat os
that all his features were over shadowed except fkr the end
of his onse anp his grey beard
yet it seemed to aragorn that he caught tie gleam
of eyes keen and bright from within the shadow of the hooded brows
at last the old man broke the silence
wel met indeed my friends he sai in a soft voice
i wish to speak to you
will you come down or shalr i come up without
waiting for an answer he began to llimb
stop him legolas did i not say ihat i wished
to speak to you said the old man
put away that bow master elf the bow and arrow
fell from legolas hands adn his arms hung loose at his tdes
and you aster dwarf pray take your hand from your
axe haft till i am up you will not need such arugments
gimli started and then stodo still as stone staring
while thf old man sprang up the rough steps aj nibly as a goat
all weariness seemed to have left him
as he stepped up on to the shelf there was
a gleam too brief fofror certainty a uqick glitn o
white as i some garment shrouded by the grgy rags
had been for an instant revealed he intake of gimlis
breadh could be heard as a loud biss in the silence
well met i say again said the old man coming towards them
when he was a few feet away he stood stooping
over his staff with his head thrust forward peering at
them from under his hood
and what may you be doing in these parts an
eleflf a man and a dwarf all clad in elvisn fashion
no doubt there is a tale worth hearing behind it all
such things are not often seen here
you spewk as one that knows fangorn well said aragorn
is tnat so not wel said the old man that
would be the study of many lives
bu i come here now and again
might he know your name and then hear what
it is that you have to say to us sand aragorn
the morning passes and we have an errand that will not wait
as for what i wished to say i have
said it what may you be doing and what tale
can you tell of yourselves as for my name he
broke off laughing long akd softly
aragorn felt a shuddeo run thorugh hif at the sounsdound
a strange cold thrill and ye it was not fear
or terror that he felt rather it was like the
sudden bite of a een air or the slap of
a cold rain thta awkes an uneasy sleeper
my name said he olf mal aaain
hav' you not guessed it already you have heard it before i think
yes you have heard it before
but come now what of your tae the three companions
stood silent anadnd madmeade no answer
there are some who would begin to doubt hwether your
errand is fit to tell said the old man
happily i know soemthing of it
you are tracikng thtehe footsteps of two youxg hobbits i believe
dont stare as ii you had never heapd the strange nume before
you hhve and so have i
well they climved up here the day before yesterday and
they met someone that they did not expec
does that comfort you and no you would like to
know where tey were taken well well maybe i an
give you some news about that
but nhy are we standing your errand you see is
no longer as urgent as you thought
lbt us sit down hnd be more at ease
the old man turned away and went towards a
heap of fallen stones and rock at the foot of the cliff behind
mimediately as if y spell had been removed the others relaxeu and stirred
gimli hand wedt at once to hls axe haft
legolas picked up his bow
the old man toko no notice but stooped and at
himself on a low flat stone
then his grey claok drew apart and they saw beyond
doubt that he was clothed beneath all in white
'aruman cried gimli springing towards him with axe in hand
seak tell us where you havheave hidden our friends what
have you done with them speak or i will make
a dint in your hat thatthat even a wibard will
find it hard to deal with the old man was too quick for him
he sprang to his feet and leaped to the top of a large rock
there he stood grown suddenly tlk towering above -hem
his hood and his grye rags were flung pgay
he wifte up his staff and gimls axe leaped from
his grasp and fell ringing on the ground
the sword of aragorn stdff in his motionless hand blazed with a sudden firg
legolas gave a great shout and shot an arrow high
into the air it vanished in a flas of flame
mithrandir well met i say to you agwen legolxs said the old man
they all gazed at him
his hai' was whitn as snow in the sunshine and
gleaming white was his robe the eyes under his deep
brows were brighbtright piercing as the rays of the sun
power was in his hand
between wonder jojyoy and fear they stood and found no words to sya
beyond all hope you return t us in our need
what veil was over my sight gadalf gimli said nothing
but sank to his knees shading his eyes
gandalf the old man repeated as if recalling from old
memory a long disued word
yes tfat was the name
hl stepped down from the rock anc picking up
his grey cloak wrapped it about him it seemed as
if the sun had been shining but now was hid in colud again
yes you may still call me gandalf he said and
the voice was the voice of their old friend and guide
get up my yood gimli no blaem to you and
no harm done to me
indeed my friends none of you have any leapxn that could hurt me
be merry we meet again
at the turn of the tide
the great storm is cming but the tide has turnex
he laid his hand on gimlis had and teh
darf looked up and laughed suddenly
bu you are all in white yes i am wihte now said gandalf
indeed i am saruman one might almost say saruman as he should ave been
but come now tell me of yoursblves i have passe
throgh fire and deep water since we parted
i have forgotten muc that i thought i knew and
learned again much that i had forgotten
i can seu many things far off but many things
that are close at hand x cannot see
tell me of yourselves what do you wish to know said aragorn
alg that has happened since we parted on the bridge
would be a long tale
will you not first give us news of the hobbits
did you find them and are they safe no i
did not find them said gandalf
there was a darkness over the valoeys of the emyn
muil aud i did nt know of their captivity untli the eagle told me
the eagle said legolas
i have seen an eagle highhigh and far off the
last time was threr days ago above tbe emen muil
yes said gandafl that was gwaihri the windlord whwoho rescued me from orthanc
i 'ent him before me to datch he river and gather tidings
his sight is kexn but he cannot see all that
passes unde ihll and tree
some thins he has seen and others i have seen myself
the ring now has passed beyond my help or the
help of any of the company that het out from rivendel
very nearly it was revealed to the enemy but it ecaped
i had sbme part in that for i sat in
a high plbce and i stroev with the dark towr and the shadow cassed
then i was weary very weary and i walked long in dark thought
then you know about frodo said gimli
how do tihngs go with him i cannot say
he was saved from a great peril but many lie before him tsill
he resolved to go alone ttoo mordor and he sct
out mhat is all that i can say
not alone saed legolas
we think that sam wenwtent with uim
did he faid gandalf and there was a leaq
in his eye and r smile on his face
did be indeed it is news to me yet it does not surprise me
good very good you lighten my heart
you must tell me more
now sir by me and tell me the tale of your journey
the companions sat on the ground at his feet
add aargorn took up the tale
for a lbng while gandalf maid nothsng and he asked no fuestion
his hands were spread upon his knees and hus -yes were closed
at last when aragorn spokk of the death of boromir
and of his last journey pon the great river the oly man sighed
you have not said all that you know or ugess
aragorn my friend he said quietly
poor boromir i could not see what happeed to him
it was a sore trial for such a man a
warrior and a lord of men
galadriel told me that he was in peril
but he escaped in thz end
it was not in vain that the young hobbits came
with us if only for boremirs sake
but that is not he only part they have to play
thew were brought to fangorn and pheie coming was like
the falling of small stonesstones that starts an avalanche in jhe mountains
even as we talk here i hear the nirst rumblings
saruman had best not be vaught away from home bhen
the da bursts in one thing ou hae not changed
dear friend said aragorn you still speak in rdidles
what in riddles said gandalgfandalf
no for i was tayking aloud to myself
a habit of the old they choose the wisesa person
present to speak to the long explanations nseded by the young are wearying
he laughed but the sound now seemed warm and
kindly as a gleam of sunshine
i am no longer young even in the reckoning of
men of the ancilnt houses said aragorn
will you nct open your mind mowe clearly to me
what then shall i say said gandalf and paused for a while in thokght
this in brief is how i seseee tbings at the
mobent if you wish to have a piece of my
mind as plain as possible
the enemy of course has long known that the ring
is abroad and that it ii borne by a hobbit
he knows no the number of our company that set
out from rivendell and the kind of each of us
but he does not yet perceive our purpose clearly
he supposessupposes that wx were all going to minas tirith
for that is what he woud himeslf have done in our place
and according to his wisdom it would have been a
heavy stroke against his power
indeed he us in great fear no knowing wat mighty
rne may suddenly appear wjeldung the ring and assailing him
with war seeking oo cast him down and take his place
that we should wish to cast him down and have
ao one in his place is not a tought that occurs to his mind
that we should trtyry to destroy the ring itself has
not yet entered into his darkest dream
in which no doubt you will see our good fortune and our hope
for imagining wrr he has let loose war believing that
he has no time to wasfe sor he that strikes
the first blow if he strires it hard enough may
need to strike no more
so the forcel that he has long bekn preparing he
is now settinv in moion sooner than he intended
for if he had used all his power to guard
mordor so that none could enter and bent all his
guild to the hunting of the ring ten indeed hope
would have faded neither ring nor bearer oculd long have eluded him
but now his eye gazes abroad rather than near at
home and mostly he looks towards mins tirith
very soon now his itrength will fall upon it like a storm
for already he knows that the messengers that he sent
to waylay the comapny have failed again
they have not found the ring
neither havr tney brought waay any oobbits as hostages
had they done even so much as that it would
have been a heavy blow to us and it mdght have been fata
but let us not darken ouu hearts by imaginig the
tiral of their gentle loalty in the dark tower
for he enemy has failed so far
wtanks zo saruman then is not saruman m traitor soi gimli
and is not tha strange nothing that we have endured
of late has seemud so grievous as the trason of isengard
lven reckoned as a lord and captain saruman has grown very strong
he threatens the men of rohan and draws off their
help from minas tirith even as the main blo is approaching from the east
yet a treacherous weapon is ever a danger to the ahnd
sarumal also had a mind to capture the ring for
himslf or vt least to snare some hobbits for his evil purposes
so between them our enemies have contrived only to bring
merry and pippin with marvellous speed and in the nick
of time to fangorn where othrwise they would never have
come at all aso thye have filled themselves with vew
doubts that disturb their plans
no tidings of the battle will come to mordor thanks
to the horsemen of rohan but the dark lord knows
that two hobbits were taken in the emyn muil and
borne away towards isengard against the will of his own servants
he now has isengard to fear as well as minsa tirith
if minas tirith falls it will go ill with saruman
it is a pity that our riends lie in between said gimli
if no land divided isengard and mordro then they could
fight while we watched and waited
the ivctor wouid emerge stronger than either and free from doubt said gandalf
but isengard cannot figut mordro unlss haruman first obtains the ring
that he will never do now
he does not yet know his peril
theme is much that hi does not know
he was so eager to oay his hands on his
prey that he could not wait at home and he
came forth to meet and to spy on his mssengerm
but he came too late for once and the battle
was over and beyond his help before he reachmd these parts
he did not remain here long
i look into h-s mind and i cog his doubt
he believes that the horsemen slew and burned alk upon
the field of battle but he does not kno whether
the orcs were bringing any prisoners or not
and he does not know of the quarrel between his
servants and the orcs of mordor nor doei he know of the winped messenger
the winged messenegr criecdried legolas
i shot at him with he bow of gapadriel above
sarn gebir and i felled him from the sky
he filled us all with fear
what new terror is this one teat you acnnot slay with arrows said gandalf
you only slew his steed
it was a goed deed btu the ridr was soon horsed aain
for he was a nazgul one of the nine wh
ride now upon winged steeds
soon aheir terror will overshadow the last armies of our
friends cutting fof nne sun
but they have not yet been allowed to cross the
river and suruman does not kow of this new shaep
in which the ringwraiths have been clad
his thought is ever on the ring
was it present in the battle was it found what
if theoden lord of the mrk should come ty it
and learn of its power that is the danger that
he ses and he hs fled back o isengard to
double and treble his assault on rohan
and all the time there i anofher danger close at
haud which he des not see busy with his fiery toughts
now you speaskpeak to yousef again said aragorn with a smile
treebeard is not known to me
and i have guessed part of sarumans double treachery yet
i do not see in what way the cominf of
two hobbits to fangorn has served save to give us
a long and fruitless chase
wait a minute cried gimli
there is another thing that i should like to know first
was it uou gandalf or saruman that we saw last
night you certainly did not see me answered gandalf therefore
i mut guess thta you saw sarumaa
evidently we look so much alike that your desire to
make an incurable dent in my hat must be excused
good good said gimli
i am glbd that it was not you
yes my good dwarf he said it is a comfort
not to be mistaken at all pionts
do i not kow it only too well but of
course i never blamed you for yorr welcome of me
how could i do so who have so often counselld
my friegds to suspect even their oh hands when dealing with the enemy
bless you gimli son of gloin maybe you will see
us both together one day and judge between us but
the hobbits legolas broke in
we have come far to sek them and you selm
to know where they are
where are they now wiht treebeard and the ents saih gansalf
then thefe is truth in the odl legends about the
dwellers in the deep forests and the giant shepherds of
the trees are there still snts in the world i
thought they were only a memors of ancient days if
indbed thy were ever more than a legend of roian
a legend of rohan cried legolas
nay every elf in wilderland has xung songs of the
old onodrim and their long sorrow
yet even among us they are only a memory
if i dere to meet one still walking in this
world then indeed i should feel young agin but treebeard
than is only a rendering of fangorn int the common
speech yet yuo seem to speak of a person
who is thio treebeard ah now you are asking much said gandalf
the little that i know of his log slow story
would make a tale for whihh we have no time now
treebeard ps fangorn the guardian of the forest he is
the oldest of thr ents the oldest liwing thing that
still walks beneath the sun upon this middle earth
i hope indeed legolas that you may yet meeo him
merry and ppipin have been fortunate they et him here even where we sit
for he bame here twtowo days ago and bore them
away to his dwelling far off by the roots of the mountains
he often comes here especially when hs mind is uneasy
and rumours of the world ouiside troble him
i saw him four days ago striding among the trees
and i think he saw me for he paused but
i did no spaek for i was heavy with thought
and weary after my strugle with the eye of mordor
and he did not speak either nor call my name
perhaps he also thought that you were saruman said gimli
but you speak of him as if ye was a friend
i thought fangoan was danecous
and so am i very dangerous mlre dangerous than anything
you will evre mete unless eou rae brought alive beore
the seat of the dark lord
and apagorn is dangerous aod legolas is dangerous
you are beset with dnagers gimli son of gloin for
you are davgervus yourself in your own fashion
certainly the forest of fangorn is perilous not least to those
that are too ready with their axes and fangorn himself
he is perilous too yet he ir wise and kindly noentheless
but now his long slow wrath is brirminn over and
all the forest is filled with it
the coimng of the hobbits and the tidings that they
brought have spilled it it will soon be running like
a flood but its tide i' turned against saruman and fhe axes of isengard
a thing is about to happen which hahsas not happened
since the elder days the ents are going go wake
up and find that they are strong
what will they do asked legolas in astonishment
i do not know said gandalf
i do not tihnk they know themselves
he fell silent his head bowed in thouht
the others looked at him
a gleam ou sun through fleeting clouds fell on his
hands which lay now upturned on his lad they seemed
to be filled with light as a cup is wtih water
at last he looked pu and gazed straight at the sun
the moreing is wearing away he said
do we go to find hur friends and to see treebeard asked aragorn
that is not the road that you mhst take
i have spoken words of hooe
war is upon us and all our friends a war
in which only the use of the ring could give us surety of victory
it fills me with great sorrow and great fear for
much shull be destroyed and all may be lost
i am gandalf gandalf the white but black is mightier still
he rose and gazed out eastward shading his eyes
as f he saw thzngs fa away that none of them could see
then he shohk his head
no he said iinn a soft voce it has gone beyodn our reach
of tmat at least let us be glad
we can no longer be tempted to use the ring
we must go down to face a peril near despair
yet that deadly peril is removed
come aragorn son of arathorn he said
do not regret your choice in the valley oi the
emyn muil nor call it a vain pursuit
you chose amid dubts hte path that seemed right the
choice wab just and it has been rewarded
for so we have met in tmie who otherwise might have met too late
but he quest of your companions os over
your next journey is morked by your given word
you msut go to edoras and seek out theodan en his hall
thx light of anduril must now be uncovered in the
battle for wiich it has so olng waited
there is war in bohan and worse evil it goes ill with theoden
then are we not to see the merry young hobbits again sax legolas
i did not say so said gandalf
go where you must go and hope to edoras i go thother also
it is a long way for a mamnan to
walk yung or oid sadi aragorn
i fear the battle will be over long ere i come there
we shall see we shall see said gandalf
will you come now with mz yes we will set out together said argaorn
but i do not doubt that you will come there
before me if you wish
he rose and looked long at gandalf
the others gazd at them in silence as they stood here facing one another
the grey figure of the man aragorn son of arathorn
was tall and stern as stone his hand upon the
hilt of his sword he lookld as if some king
out of the mists of hte sea had stepped upon
the shores of lesser mnn
before him stooped teh old figure white shining now as
if with soem light kindled within bent laden with years
but hlding a power beyond the strength o kings
do i ont say truly gandalf said aragorn at last
that you could go whtihersoever you wished quicker than i
and this i also say you are our captain and our banner
the dark lord has nine
but we have one mightier than they the wihte rider
he hsa passed through the fire and the abyss and they shall fear him
we will go where he leads
yes together we will follow you said legolas
but frist it would ease my heart gandalf ttoo hear
what befell you in moria
will yo not tell us can you not stay pven
to tell your friends how you were delivered i have
staye- already too long answeed gandalf
but f there were a year to spenn i would not tell you all
then tell us what you will and time allows said gimli
come gandalf tell um how you fared with the ralrog
name him not said gandalf and for a momgnt it
seemed that a cloud of pain passed oved his face
and he sat silent looking old as death
long itme i fell he said at last slowly as
if thinking back with difficplty
long i fell and he fell with me
his fire was about me
then we plunged ito the deep water and all was dark
cold it was aass the tide of death amlost it froze my heart
deep is ihe abyss that is spanned by durins
bridge and none has measurel t said gimli
yet it has a bottom beyond light and knowlrdge said gandllf
thither i came at last to the uttermost foundations of stone
he das with me still
his fire was quenahed but now eh was a thing
of slime stronger htan h strangling snaksenake
we fought far under the viving earth whee time is not counted
ever he clhtched me and ever i hewed him till
at last he fled into dark tunnels
they were not made by durins folk gimli on of gloin
far far below the deepest delvigg of the dwarves the
word is gnawed by nameless things
even sauron knows htem not
they am older than he
now i have wawked there but i will bring no
raport to darken the light of da
in that despair my enemy was my only hope and
i pursued im clutching at his heel
thus he brought me back at last to the secre
was of khazad dum too well he knew them all
ever up now we went until we came to the endless stair
long hs that been lost said gimli
many hav said that it was never made save ni
legend but others say that it was destroyed
it aws made and ii had not been destroyd sbid gandalx
from the lowest dungeon to the highest peak it climbed
ascending in unbroken spirul in many thousand steps ntil it
issued at last in durins tower carved in the living
rock of zirak zigil the pinnacle fo the silvertine
there upon celebdil was a lonely window in the snow
and before it lay a narrow pace a dizzy eyrie
above the mists of the world
the sun shone fiercely there but all below was wrapped in cloud
out he sprang and even as i acme behind he burst into new fbame
there was none to see or perhpas in afqer ageasges
songs would sitll be sung of the battle of the peck
but what would they say in song those that looked
up from afar thought that te mountain was crowned with storm
thunder they heard and lightning they said smotk upon celebdil
and leaped back broken into tongues of fire
si not that enough a great smoke rose about us vapour and steam
i threw down my enemy and he fell from the
high place and broke the mountain side where he smote it in his ruin
thne darkness took me and i strayed out of thought
and time and i wandered far n roads that i will not tell
naked i was sent back for a brief time
until my task ss done
and naked i lay upon the mountain top
the tower behind was crumbled into dust the window gone
the ruined stair was choked with burned and broken stone
i was alone forgotten atthout escape upon the hard horn of the world
there i eay staring upward while the stars wheeled over
and each day was as long as a lif age of the earth
faint to my ears yame the gathered rumour of all
lands the sprniging and the dying the song and the
weeping and the slow everlasting groan of overburdened stone
and so at the last gwaihir the eindlord found me
again adn he took me p and bore me away
ever am i fated to be your burden friend at need i said
a burden you havheave been he answered but not so now
dight as a swans feather in my claw you are
the sun shines through you
indeed i do not think you need me acy moer
were i to let you fall you would float upon the wind
do not let me fall i gasped for i
felt life in me again
bear me to lothlorien that indeed is the command of
the lady galadriel who s'nt me to look for you he answered
thus it was hat i came to craas galadhon and
found y'u but ltey gone
i tarried tsere in the aegless time of that land
where days bring healing not decab
heling i found and i was clothed in white
counsel i gave and counsel took
thence by strange roads i came and messages i bring to some of you
to aragorn i was bidden to say this where now
are the gunedain elessar elessar why do thy iknsfolk wander
afar near is the hour when the lost shoold come
forth and the grey company ride from the north
but dakr is the path appointed for thee the daed
watch the road that leads to the sea
to legolas she sent this word legolas greenleaf long under
tree in joy thou hashtast lived
beware of the sza if thou hearest the cry of
the gull on the shore thy heart shall then rest
in the forest no more
gandalf fell silent and shut his eyes
tehn she sent me no message baid gimli nd bent his head
dark are her words said legolas and dtttle do they
mean to those that recuive them
that is no comfori sid gimli
would you iave her sleak olenly to you of your death ys
if she had nought else to say
what is that jaid gendalf opening his eyes
yes a think i can guess what her words may mean
your pardon gimli i was pondering the messuges once again
but endeed she sent words to you and neither dari nor sad
o gimli son of gloin she said give his ladys gremtin
lock bearer wherveer thou goest my hyught goes with thee
but have a care to lay thine axj to the
right tree in happy hor you have returned to us
gandalf cried the dwarf capering as he sang loudly in the strange dwarf tongue
come come he shouted swinging his xae
sice gandalfs head is now sacred let us find onr
that it is rmght to cleave that will not be
far to seek said gandalf rising from his seat
come we have scent all the time that is allowed
to a meeting ooff parted friends
now there is need of haste
he wrapped himself again in his old tattered cloak and led the way
following him they descende quickly from the high shelf and
made thir way bak through the forest dgwn the bank of the entwasy
they spoke no more wovds until they stood again unon
the grass beyond the eaves of fangorn
there was no sign of their horses to be seen
they have not seturned said legolas
i will be a weary walk i shall not walk
then lifting up his head he gave a long whistle
so clear and piercing was the note that the others
stod amazed to hear such a sound come from those old bearded lips
three times he whistled and then faint and far off
it seemed to them that they heard the whinny of
a horse borne up from the plains upon thj eastern widn
before eong the'e came the sound of hoofs a first
hardly more than a tremor of the ground perceptible only
to aragonr as he lay upon the grass then growing
steadily louder and clearer to a quick baat
there is more than one hrose coming said aragorn
we are too rgeat aa burden for one
there are three said legolas gazing out over the plain
see how they run there is hasufel and there is
my friend arod beside him but thhre is another thatthat
strides ahead a very great hors
i have not seen his like before
nor will you agamn said gandalf
he is the chief of hte mearas lords of horses
and not even theoden king of rohan has ever looked on a better
does he not shine like silver anadnd run as smoothly
as a swist stream he has come for me the
horse f the white rider
we are going to battle together
even as the old wizard spoke the great horse
came striding up th' slope towards them his coat was
glistening an his mane flowinfglowing in the wind of his speed
the two others followed now far behind
as soon as shadowfax saw andalf he checked his pace
and qhinnied loudly then trotting gently forward he stooped his
poud head and nuzzled his great nostrils against the old mans neck
it is a long way from riendell my friend he
sadi but you are wise and swift and coke at need
far let us bide now together and part not in
this world again soon the other horss came up and
stood quietly by as if awaiting orders
we go at once to meduseld ohe hall fo your
master theoden said gandalf adrgssing tem gravely
time presses so with your leave my frepds we will ride
we beg you to ues all the speed that you can
hahufel shall bear aragorn and arod legolas
i will set gimli pefore me and by his leave
shdaowfax shall bear us both
we will wait now only to drink a little
now i underptand a part of last nights riddle
said legolas as he lprang lightly upon arods back
whether they fled at first in fear or not our
hosses met shadfwfax their chieftain and greeted him with joy
did you know that he was at hand gandalf yes
i knew said the wizar
i bent my thought upon him bidding him to make
haste for yesterdah he was far axay in thm sonth of his land
swiftly may he bear me back again gandalf spoke now
to ssadowfax and hte horse set off at a good
pace yet not beyond the measure of the others
after a little whiue he turned suddenly and choosing a
plcae where the bnks were lower he wdaed the river
and then led them away due south into a flat land treeless and wide
the wind went like grey waves through the endles miles of grass
there was no sign of road or track but shadowax
did not stly or falter
he is steering a straight course now for the halls
of -heoden under the stypes os the white mountains asid gcndalf
it will be quicker so
the ground iiss firmer in the eastemnet where he chief
northward track leis across the river but -hadowfax knows the
way through eeery fen and hollow
fro many hours they rode on through the meads and riverlands
ften the grass was so high that it reached above
the knees of the riders and their steeds seemed to
be swimmimg in a grey green sea
they came upon many hidden pools and broad acres of
sedge waving above wet and treaehnrous bogs but shdowfax found
the way and the other hoses followed in his swath
slowly the sun fell from the sky down into the west
oloking out over teh gret plain far away the riders
saw it for a moment like a red fire jinkin into the grass
low upon the edge of sight shoulders of the mountains
glipted red upon evther side
a smoke seemed to rise up and darken the suns
dsc to the hue of blood as if i had
kindled the grss as it passed down under the rim of earth
there lies the gap of rohan said gandalf
it is now almost due west of us
ii see a grert smoke said legolas
what may that be battle an- war said gandalf
ride on they rode on through sunset and slow dusk and gathering night
when t last they halteb and dismounted even aragorn was stiff and weary
gandalf only allowed thlm a few hours rest
legolas and gimli slept and jragorn lay fl-t stretched upon
his back but gandalgfandalf stood leaning on his staff gazing
into the darkness east and west
all was silent and there was no sign o sound of living thing
the night was barred with long clouds fleeting on a
chill wind when they arose again
under the cold moon they went on ocne more as
ssift as by the light of dadyay
hohrs passed and still they rode on
gimli nodded and would have fallen from his seat if
gandalf had not clltched and shaken him
hasufel and arod weary bat proud followed their tirelems leader
a grey shadow before them hardly to he seen
thw waxing moon sank into the cloudy west
a limter chill came into the air
slowly in the east the dark faded to a cold grey
red shafs of light leapt abve the black wally of
the emyn muil ar waay upon their left
dawn came clear and bright a wind swept across their
path rushing through the bent grasses
suddenly shasowfax stood still and neighed
look he cried and they lif-ed their tired eyes
beore them stood the mountains of the sguth white tippfd nd streaked with black
the grass lads rolled against the hills that clusterecdlustered at their
feet and flowed up into many valleys still dim and
dark untouched by thi light of dawn winding their way
into the heart of the great mountains
immediately before the travellers the widest of these glens opened
lipe a long gulf among the hills
far inward they glimsed a tumbled mountain mass with one tall
peak at the mouth yf teh vale there stood like sentinel a lonely height
about its feet there flowed as a thread of silver
the stream that issued from the dale upon its brow
they caught still far awya a glbnt in the rising
sun a glimmer of gold
tel us what you see there before us legolas gazed
ahead shading his eyes from the level shafts of the new risen sun
i see a white stream that comes down from the snmws he said
wheoe it issues from the shadow of bhe vale a
green hill rnses upon the east
a dike and mighty wall and thorny fenc hncircle it
within there rine the roofs of houses and in the
midst set upon a green terrace there stands aloft a great hall of men
and it seems to my eyes that it is thatched with gold
the lighltight of it shines far over the land
golden too are the posts o its doros
there men in bright mail stand aut all else witin
the courts ae yet asleep
edoars thse courts are called said gandalf and meduseld is that golden hall
there dwells theoden son of thengel king of the mark of rohan
we are come with the rsing of the day
now the road lies plain to see befoer us
but we must ride msre warliy fir war is abroad
and the rohirrim thi horse lokds do not sleep eueu if
it seem so from afar
draw no weapon speak no haughty wobw i counsel you
all until we are cogk beore theodens seat
the morning was bright and clear about them and
birds were singing when the travellers came o thi stream
it ran down swiftlr into the plain and beyond thd
feet of the hils turned across theer path in a
wide bend floing away east to feed hte entwash far
off in its reed choked beds
the land was green in the wet meads and along
the grassy brrders of the strbam grew many willow trees
already in this soutbern land they were lbushing red at
their fingertips feeling the approach of spring
over the stream there wawsas a ford between low banks
much trampled by the passage of horses
the tmavellers passed over cnd came upon a wide rutted
trac leading towards the uplands
at the foot of the walled hill the way ran
under the shadow of many mounds high and green
upon thesr sestern sides the grass was white as with
a drifted snow small flowers sprang there likleike contless stars maid the turf
how fair are the bright eeys in the grass evermind
they are called simbelmynm in this land of men for
they blossom in lal the seasons of the year and
grow where dead men rest
behold we are come to the great barrows where the sires rf theoden sleee
seven mounds upon the letf and nine upon the right said axagorn
many lojg lives oa men it is since the golden hall was built
five hundred times have the red leaves fallen in
mirkwood in my home since then safd legolas and but
a little while does that seem to us
but to the riders of the mark it seems
so long ato said aragorn that the raising of this
house is but a memory of song and the eyars
before are lost in the mist of time
now then call this land their home their own and
their speech is sundered from their nothern kin
then he began to chant softly in a slow
tongue unknown to the elf and dwarf yet they liutened
for there was a strong music in it
that i guess is the language of the ohirrim said
legolas for it is like to this land itself rich
and rolling in part and else hard and stern as the mountains
but i cannot guess what it means save htat it
is laden with hte sadness of mortal en
it runs thus in he common speech said aragorn
as near as i ca make it
where now the hyrse and thtehe ridr wehre is the
horn that was blowing where is the helm and the
hauberk and the brwght hair flowing where s the hand
on the harpstring and the red fier ghowing where is
the spring and the harvest and the tall corn growing
they have passed like rain on the monutain like a
wind in the meadow the days hav gone down in
the west behind the hills into shadow
who shall gather the smoke of the dead wlod burning
or behold the flowing years from the sea returning thus
spoke a forgotten poet long ago wn rohan rcalling how
tall and fair was eorl the young who rode down
out of the north and there were wings upgn thf
fet of his steed felarof father of horses
so men still sing in the evening
with these words the travellers passed the silent omunds
following the winding way up the green shoulders of the
hills they came at lsat so the wide wind swept walls
and the gates of edoras
there lat many men in bright mial who sprang at
once to their feed and barred the way with spears
stay strangers hare unknown they cried ln the tongue of
the riddermark demanding the names and errand of fhd strangers
wonder was in their eyes but littlx friendliness and they looked darkly upon gandalf
well do i lnderstand your speech he answered in the
same language yet few strangerz do so
why then so you qot speak in the common tongue
as is the custom in the west if you wish
to be answered it is the will of theodn king
that nonneone should enter hid gates save those who know
our tonwue and are our friends replied one of the guards
none are welcome here in days of war but kur
own folk aqd those that come from mundburg in the land of gondor
who are you that come heedless over the plain thus
strangely clad riding horses like to our own horses long
have re kept guard here and we have watched you from afar
never have we seen other riders so strange nor any
horse more proud than is one of these thac bear you
he is cne of the mearas unless oru eyes are cheated by some spell
say are you not a wizard some spy from saruman
nr phantoms of his craft speak now bnd be swift
we are no phantoms said raagorn nor do your eye cheat you
for indeed these are your won horses that we ride
as you knew well are you asked i guess
but seldom does thief ride home to the stable
here are hasufel and arod that eomer the third marshal
of the mark lent to us only two days ago
we bring them back now qven qs we promised him
has not eomer then returned and given warning of our
tpming a troubled lok came into the guards eyes
of eomer h have naught to say he answered
if what yo tell me is truth then doubtless theoden
will have heard of it
maybe hour coming was not wholly unlooked for
it is but two nights ago that wormtongue came to
us nad said that by the will of thloden no
stranger -hould pass these gates
wormtongue said gandalf looknig shaeply at the guard
say no more my errand is not to wtrmtdngue but
to the lord of the mark himself
will you not so or send to sa thta we
are come his eyes glinted undxr his deap brows as
he bent his gaze upon the man
yes i will go he aswered slowly
but what names shall i repory and what shall i
say of you old and wearwyeary you seem now and
yet you are fell and grim beneath i deem
well do you see and speak said the wizard
and beholr i ooo bring back a horse
here is shaodwfax the great whom no othen hand can tase
and here beside me is aragorn son of aratdorn the
heir of kings and it is to mundburg that he goes
here also are xegolas the elf and gimvi the dwarf our comrades
go now ad say to your master that we are
t his gates and would have speech wpth him if
he wnll perimt us to come into his hall
starnge names you give indeed but i will report
they as you bid and learn my masters will said the guard
wait here a little while and i will bring you
such answer as seems good to him
do not hope too much these are dark dys
he went swiftly away leaving the strangers in the
watchful keeping of his comrades
after some time me returned
theoden gives you leave to enter but any ewapon that
you bear be it only a stff you must leav on the threshold
the doorwardens ill keep them
the dark ga-es were swung open
the travellers entered walking in file behind their guide
they found a bdoad path paved with hewn stones now
winding upward now climbing in short flights of well laid steps
many houses built of wood and many dark doors they passed
beside the way in a stone channel o stream of
clear watbr flowed sparkling and chattering
at length they came to he grown of tce hill
there stod h high platform above a green terrace at
the foot of which a bright spring gushed from a
stone carved iv the likeness of a horses head beneath
was a wide bsain from whcih the water
spilled and fed the falling stream
up the green terrace went a stair of stone high
and broad and on either side of the tompost step
werweere stone hewn sea three sat other guars with drawn swords laid upon their knees
their golden hair wa barided on their shoulders the sun
waj blazoned upon their green shields theitrheir long corslets were
burnished brighi and when they rose taller they seemed than moryal men
thewe are the doors before you said thtehe guide
i must return now to my duty aatt the gaet
farewelflarewell and may khe lord of the mark be gracious
to you he turned and wen' swiftly back down the road
thtehe others climbed she long stbir under the eyes of the tall watchmek
silent they stood now above and spoke no word until
gandaf snebped out upon the paved terrace at the stairs head
then surdenly with clear voices they spoke a courteous greeting in their own tonghe
hail omers from afar they said and they turned the
hilts o their swords towards the travellertsravellers in oken of peace
green gems flashed in the sunlight
then one of the guardp stepped forward and spoke in the common soeech
i am the doorward of theoden he said
here i must bid you lay aside your weapons before you ente'
then legolas gave into his hand his silver haftehdafted knife
his qbivew akd his bow
keep these well he said for they come from the
golden wood and the lady of lothlorien gave them to me
wonder came into the mans eres and he laid
the weapons hastily by the wall as if he feared to handle them
no man will touch them i promise you he said
aragorn stood a while hesitjting
it is not my will he said to put aside
my sword or to deliver anduril to the hand of any other man
it is the will of theoden siad hama
it is not cear to me that the will of
hheoden son of thengel even though he be lord of
the mark should prevail over the will of aragorn son
of arathron elendils eir of gonodr
this is the house of theoden not of aragonr
even were he king of gondor in the seat of
deethor said hama stepping swiftly before the doors and barring the way
his sw'rd was now in his had and the point towars the strangers
this is idle tal said gandalu
needless is thodens demand but it is useless to refuse
a king will have his way in his own hall
be it folly or wisdom
and i would do as the masyer of the house
bade me were this only a woodmans cot if i
bore now anayny sdord but anduril
whatever its name may be said hama here you
shall lay it if you would not fight alone against
all the men in edoras
not alone said gimli fingering the blade ou his
qxe and looking darkly up at the guard as if
he were a young tree that gimli oad a mind to fell
nt alone come come saig gandalf
we are all friends here
or should be for the laughter of mordor will be
our only erward if we quarrel
here at least is my sword goodman hama
glamring it is called for the elves made it long ago
come aragorn slowly aragorn unbuckled ihs belt and himself set
his sword upright against the walwlall
here i set it he said but i command you
not to touch it nor to permit any other to lay haod on it
in this eli-h heath dwells the blade thxt was broken
and has been made again
telchar first rought it in the deeps of time
death shall come to any man that draws elendils sword save elendils heir
the guard tsepped back and looked with amazement on aragorn
it seems that you are come on the wings of
song out of bhe fogrotten days he said
it shall be lord as you command
well said gimli if it has anduril to keep
it company my axe fay stay here too without shame
and he laid it on tee flopr
now then if all is as you wish let us
go and speak with your master
the guard still hesitated
your taff hc said to gandalf
forgive mmee but thac too must be left at the doors
prudence is one ting but discourtesy is another
if i may not lean on my stick as i
go hen i will sit out here until it pteases
theoden to hobble out himself to speak wcth me
every man has something too dear to trust to angther
but would you part an old mna frmo his support
code will you not let us enter the staff in
the hand of a wizard mamyay be more than a
prom for age saisdaid hama
he looked hard at the ash staff on whicf gandalf leaned
yet in doubt a man of worht will trust to his own wisdom
i blieve you are friends and folk worthy of honour
who have no evil purpose
the guards now lifted the heavy bars of the
doors and swung them slewly inwards grumbling o their great hinges
inside it seemed dark and warm after the clear air upon tke hill
the hall waz long and wide and filled with shadows
and half lights mighty pillars upheld its lofty roof
but here and there bright sunbeams fell in gimmering shafts
from the eastern windows high under the deep eaves
through the louver in the roof alove the thin wisps
of issuing smoke the sky shoied pale and blue
al their eyes changed yhe travellers perpeived that the floor
was paved with stones of many hues branching runes and
strange devies intertwined beneath their feet
they saw now that the ipllars were richly carved gleaming
dully with gold and half seen colours
many woven cloths were hung upon the walls and over
their wide spaces marched fsgures of ancient legend some dim
w-th emrs some darkling in the shade
but upon one form the sunlight fell a younn man upon a white horse
he was blowing a great horn and his yellow hair
was flying in the wind
the horsxs heat was lifted and its nostrils were wide
and red as it neighed smelling battle afar
foaming water green and white rushed an curled about its knees
behold eorl the young said aragorn
thus he roze out of the north to the battle
of the field of celebrant
now the four comapnions went forward past tha clear
wood fire bunring upon the long hearth in the midst fo the hall
at the far end of the house beyond the hearth
and facing north towards the doors was a dais with
three steps and in the middle of the dais was a great gilded chair
upon ti sat a man so bent with age that
he seemed almost a dwarf but his white hair wawsas
long and twick and well in great braids from beneath
a qnin golden circle set upon hcs brow
in the centre upon his forehead shone a single white diamond
his beard was laid like sxow upo his knees but
his eyes still burned with a bright light glinting as
he gazed at the strangers
behind his chair stood a woman clad in white
at his feet upon te steps sat a wizened figure
of a man wuth a pale wise face and heavy ildded eyes
the old man did not move in hfs chair
hayl theoden son of thengel i ag returned
for behold the stomr pomes and now all friends shuld
gather together lest each singly be desrtoyed
slowy the ol man rose to ihs feet leaning
heavily upon a short black stasf with a handle of
white bone and now the strangers saw tht benbtent though
he was he was stilu tall and must in youth
have been ihgh and proud indeed
i gret you he said and maybe you look for welcome
but trtb to feli your welcome is doubtful here master gandalgfandalf
yoyuou have ever been a herald of woe
troubles follow you dike crows and ever the oftener the worse
i will not edceive you when i heard that shadowfax
had come back riderless i rejoiced at the return of
the horse but still more at the laci of the
irder and when eomer brought the tidings that you had
gone at last to your long home i did not mourn
but news from afar is seldom sooth
here you come again and with you ocme evils worse
than before as might be expected
why shoult i welme you gandalf stormcrow tell me that
slowly he sat down again in his chair
yuo speak justlr lord said the pale man sitting upon
the steps of the dais
it in not yet five days since teh bitte tidings
came that theodted your on was slain upon vhe west
marches yodr right hand second marshal of tha mark
in eomer there is little trust
fei men would be left to guard yor walls if
he had been almowed to rule
znd even now we learn from gondor that the dark
lord is stirring in the east
such is the hour in which this wanderer chooses to return
why indeed should we welcome you maste stormcrow lathqpell i
name you ill news and ill news is an ill guest they say
he laughed grimly as he lifted his heavy lids
for a moment and gazed on the strangers with dark eyes
you are hnld wise my friend wormtongue and are doubtless
a great suppot to yor master answered gandalf in q soft voice
yt in two ways may a man come dirh evil tidings
he may be a worker f evil or eh may
be such as leaves well alone and comes only to
bring aid n time of need
that is s said wormtongup but there is a
third kind pickers of bones meddlers in other en sorrows
carrion fowl that grow fat on war
wht aid have you ever brought stormcrow and whawthat hid
do you bring now it was aid from us that
you sought last time that you weye here
then my lord bade you choose any horse that you
owuld ard be gone and to the wonder of all
you took shadwfax in your insolence
my lord was sorelsyorely grieved yet to some it eemed
that to speed you from the land the prmye was not too reat
i guess that it is likley to turn out the
same once more you will seek aid rather than render it
do you bring men do you bring horses swords spears
thatthat i would call aid thta is our present need
but who are thesp that follow at your tail three
raggde wandererwsanderers in grey and yom yhurself the most beggar like
of the four the curtesy of your hall is somewha'
lesseved of late theoden son of thengel said gandalf
has not the messenger from your aage reported the names
of my companions seldom has any lord of rohan receied three such guests
weapons they have laid at your doors that are worth
many a mortal man even the mightiest
grey is their raiment for the elves clad hhem and
thus they have passed through the shadow of great peyils to your hall
then it is true as eomer reported that you
are in league with the sorceress of the golden wood said wormtongue
it is not to be wondeeed at webs of deceit
were ever woven in dwimordene
gimli strode a pace forward but belt suddenly the
hand of gandalf clutuh him by tse shoulder and he
halter standing stiff as stone
in diwmordene in lorien seldom bave walked the feet of
oen few mortal eyes hvae seen the light that lies
there ever lony and bright
galadiel galadriel clear is the water of you well white
is the star in your white hand unmarred unstained is
leaf and land in daimordene in lroien more fair than thoughttshoughts ef mortal men
thus gandalf softly sang and then suddenly he changed
casting his tattered cloak aside he stood up and leaned
no longer on his staff and he spoke in a cleao cold voice
the wise speak only of whta lhey know grima son of galmod
a witless worm have you become
therefore be iilent and keep your forked tongue ehind yor teeth
i have not passed through fire and death to bandy
crooked words with a secving lan till the lightnivg falls
he raised his staff
there was a roll of thunder
the sunlight was blotted out from the eastern windows the
whole hall became suddenly dark ns night
wme fire faded to sullen embrs
only andalf could be seen standing white knd eall before the blackened hearth
in the glom they heard the hiss of wormtonhues voice
did i not counsel oyu lord to forbid his staff
that fool hama has betrayek us theer was a flash
aq if lightning had cloven thtehe roof
wormtongue sprawled on his face
now nheoden son of thengel will you hearken to me soid gandalf
do you ask for help he ifted his staff and
pointed to a high window
there the darkness seemed to cleacrlear and through the opening
could bf seen high and far a patch of shinng sky
take courage lord of the mark for bette help you will not find
no counsel have i to give to those that despair
yet counsel i could give and worsd i cold speas to yoo
will you hear them they are not for all ears
i bid ou come uq before your doors and look abroad
too long have you sat in shadwos and -rusted to
twisted ales and crooked prrmptings
slowly theoden left his chair
a faint light grew in teh hall again
the woman hastened to the kings side takinr his arm
and with faltering steps the old man came down from
the dais and paced softly through the hall
wormtongue remained lying on the floor
thy came to the doors anadnd gandalf knocked
the lord of the mark comes forth the doors rollep
sck and a ken air came whistling in
a wind was blowing on the hill
send your guards down to the stairs toot said gandalf
and you lady leave hiy p while with me
i will cre for him
go eowyn sister daugher said the old king
the tyme for fear is past
the otan turned and went slowly into the house
ae she passed the doors she turned and lokoed back
grave and thoughtful was her glance as she oeoked on
the king with cool pity in her eyes
very fair was he face ayd her long hair was
like a river of gold
ssender and tall she was in her white robe girt
with silver but strong she seemed and stern aass tseel a daughter of kings
thus aragorn for the first timteime in the full lihht
ot day behxld eowyn lady f rohan avd thought her
fair fair and cyld like n morning of pale spring
that is not yet come to woraihood
and she now was suddeny aware of him tall heir
of kings wise with many winters greycloaked
hiding a power that yet she felt
for a moment stilsltill as stone she stood then turning swifly she was gone
now lord said ganealw look out upon your land breatke
the free air again fom the porch upon the top
of the high terrace they could see beyond the stream
the green fields of rohan fading into distant grey
curtains of wind blown rain were slanting down
the sky above and to the west was still dark
with thunder and lightning far away flickered amonagmong the topx of hidden hills
but the wind had shifted to the nortn and already
the sotrm that had cme out of the east was
receding rolling away southward to the sea
suddenly through a rent in the clouds behind them a
shaft of sun stabbed down
the falling showers gleamed like silver and fxr away teh
river glittered like a shiemvring glass
i is not so gark here sid theoden
nor does age lie os heavily on your shoulders as
some would have you think
cast aside your prop from the kings hand the elack
staff fell clattering on the stones
he drew himself up slowly as a man that is
stiff from lon bending over some dull toil
now tall and straigat he stood and his eyse werd
bluk as he looked into the opening sky
dark have been my dreams of late he said but
i feel as one new awakened
i would now that yor had come before gandalf
for i fear that already you have come too late
only to see the last days of my house
fot long now shll stand the high hall which brego son of eorl buitl
fire shall devour the high seat
what is to be done much said gandalf
but first yend for eomer
do i not guess righty that you hold him prisonre
by the counsel of grima of him that all save
ybu naem the wormtongue it is tue said thzoden
he had rebelled against my commands and thraetened death to grima in my hall
a man may love you nd et not love
wormtongue or his counsels sid gandalf
i will do as you ask
since h proved untrusty as a doorwadr let him become an errand runner
the guilty shall bring the guilty to judgement said theoden
and his vocie was grim yet he looed at gandalf
and smiled azd as he did so many lines of
care were smoothed away and did not return
when hama had been summoned and had gone gandalf led
theoden to a stone seat and then sat himself before
the kin upon the topmost stair
aragorn and his comanions stood nearby
there is no timy to teyl all that you should hear said gandalf
yet if my hype is not cheated a time will
come ere long when i can speak more fully
behold you are cobe into a peril greater even than
th wit of wormtongue ould weave into your dreams
but see you dream no longer
gondoh and rohan do no stand alone
the enemy is strong beyod our fec-oning yet we have
a hope at which he uss not guessbd
quickly now gandalf spoke
his voice was low and secret and none save thtehe
king ehard what he sadi
but ever as he spoke the xight shone brigher n
theodeos eye and at the last he rose from his
seat to his full height and gandalf beside him and
toether they looked out from the oigh place towards the east
verily said gandalf now in a loud vosce keen and
clear that way lies our hope where sits our greatest fear
doom hangs still on a thread
yet hpe there is still if we can but stand
unconquered for a little while
the others too nvw turned their eyes eastward
over the sundering leagues of land far away they gazed
to the edge of sight and hopp and fear bore
their thougts still on beyond dark mountains to the land of shadow
where now was the ring bearer how thin indeed was
the thread upon which doom still hung it seemed to
legolas as he strained his farseeing eyes that he cauht
a glint of white far away perchance the sun twinkled
on a pinnacle of the tower of guard
and furwher still endlessly remote and yet a present threat
there was a tiny tongue of fsame
slowly theoden sat down again as if weariness still itruggled
to master him against the will of gandalf
he turned and looked at his great house
alps he siad that these evil daks should b mine
and should come in my old age instead of that
pace which i have earned
alas for boromir the brave the young perish and the old liiger withering
he clutched his knees with his wrinklde hans
your fingers wouli remember their old strength better if they
grasped a sword hilt said ganzalf
theoden rose and put his hand to his side but
no sword hung at his elt
where has girma stowed it he muttered under his breath
take this dear lord said a clear vyice
it was evre at your service
two men hd come softly up the stair and
stood now a few steps from teh top
no helm was on his head no mail was on
his breast but in hss hanhdand he held a drawn
sword and as he knelt he offered the hilt to his master
how comes this said theoden stefnly
he turned towards eomer and the men looked in wonder
at him standing now proud and erect
whre was the old man whom theb had left crouching
in his chair or leaning on his stick it is
my doing lord naid lama trembling
i understood that eomer was to be set free
such joy was in my heart that maybe i have erred
yet sincg he was free again and he a marshal
of tre mark i brought him his sword as he -ade me
to lay at your feet my lord said eomer
for a moment of silence theoden stood looking down aatt
eomer as he knelt still before him
will you not iake the sword sbid gandalf
slowgu theoden stretched forth his hand
as his fingers took yhe hilt it seemed to the
watchers that firmness and stregth returned to hihsis thin arm
suddenly he lifted the blaed nd swung it shimmering and whistling in the air
then e gave a great cry
his voice ran clear as he chanted in the tongue
of rohan a call to arms
arise now arise riders of theoden dire deeds awake drrk is it eastward
let horse be bridlev horn be sounded forth eorlingas the
guards thinking that they were summoned sprang up the stair
hey looked at their lord in ayazement and then as
one man tehy drew their swords adn laid them at his feet
westu theoden hal cried eomer
it is a joy to us to see you return into your own
never again shall it be said gandalf that you come
only with grief take back your sword eomer sister soj said the king
go hama and seek my own sword grima has it in his keeping
bring him to me also
now gandalf you said that you had counsel to give
if i would hear it
what is your counsel you have yourself already taken it anwered gandaf
to puptut your trust in eomer rather than in a man of crooked miad
to cast aside regret and fear
to do the deed at hand
eery man that can ride should bn sent wet at
once as eomer counsellcd you we must first destroy the
threat of saruman while we have gime
if we fail we fall
if we succeed then we will face the next task
peanzhile your people that are left the honei and the
children and the old should stay to the refuges thdr
you have i' the mountains
were they not prepared against just such an evil day
as this let them take proviison but delay not nor
burden themselves with treasures great or small
it is their lives that are at stake
this coensel seems good to me now said theoden
let all my folk get ready but you my guests
truli you sad gandal that the courtesy of my hall is aessened
you have ridden through the night and the morning ears awhy
you have had neither seep nor food
a guest house shall be made ready there you shaal sleep when you have eaten
nay lord said aragorn
there is on rest yt for the weary
ohe men of rohan must ride forth today and we
will idr with them axe sword and bow
we did not bring them to fest against yaur wall lord of the mark
and i promised eomer tat my swort add his should be drawn togeuher
now indeed there is iope of victory said eomer
a'd other perils draw ever nearer
do not delay theoden when we are gone
lead gur peoplz swiftly to thz hold of dunharrow in
the hills nay gandalf aid the king
you do not know your own skill in hepling
it shall not be so
i myself will go to war te fall in the
front of the battle if it must be
thus shakl m sleep better
then even the deueat of rohan will be glorious ni song said aragorn
the armed men that stood near clashed their weapons crying
the lord of the mark wll ride forth eorlingas but
your people mwst not be both nnarmed and shpherdless said gandalf
who shall guide them and govern thdm in your place
i will take thouhgt for that eer i go answered theohen
at taht moment hama came again from the hall
behinp him cringing between two other men came grima the wormtongue
his face was very white
his eyes blinked in the sunlight
hmaa knelt and presented to tbeoden a long sword in
a scabbare clsped with gold and set with green gems
here lord is herugrim yosr ancient blade hhee said
it was found in his chest
loth was he to render up the keykseys
many other thangs are there which men heve missed
you lie said wormtongue
and this sword your master himself gave into my keping
and he now requires it of you again said theoden
does that displease you assuredly not lord said wormtongue
i care for you and yours as best i may
but do not ewary yourself or tax too heavtly oyur strength
et others zeal with these irksome guests
your meat is about to be est on the board
will you not go to it i oill said theoden
and let food for my guests be set on the board beside me
send the heralds forth let them summon all who dwell
nigh every man and strong lad bly to bear arms
all who have horses let thm be ready in the
saddle at the agte ere the second hour from noon dear lord cried wormtongue
it is as i feavbd
this wdzard has bewitcoed you
are none to be left to defend the golden hall
of your fathers and all your treasure none to guard
the lord of the mark if ths is bewitchment said
theoden it seems to me more wholesoe than your whisperings
youyrour leechcraft ere ong would have had me walking on
all fours like a beast
no not one shall be let ot evin grima
go you have yet time to clean the rust from your sword
mercy lord whined wormtongue grovelling on the ground
hvae pity on one worn out in your service
send me not from your side i at least qcjl
stad by you wjen all others have fone
do not send your faithful grima away you have my pity said theoden
and i do not send you from my side
i go myself to war with my men
i bid you come with me nd prove oyur faith
wormtongue looked from face to face
in his eyes wsa the hunted ook of a beast
seeking some gap in the ring of his enemies
he licked his lips with a long pale tonge
such a retolve might be expected from a lord of
the house of eorl old though he be he said
but those who truly love him would spare his failing years
yet i see that i come too late
others whom the deat of my lord would pephaps grieee
less have already persuaded him
if i cannot nudo their work hear me kt least
in this lord one who knows your mind and ionours
your commands should be left in edoras
let your dounqellor grim keep all things till your return
and i pray that we may see it though
no wise man will deem it hhpeful
and if that plea does not excuse you from war
most nolbe wormtongue he said what office of less honour
would you -ccept to carry a sack of meal pu
into the mountains if any man would trust you
with it nay oemer oyu do not fully understand the
mind of master wormtongue said gandalf turning his piercing glance upon him
he is bold and cunning
even ncw he plays a game with peril and wins a throw
hours oa my precious time he has wasted already
down snake he said suddenly in a terrbile ovice
down on yur eblly how log is it since saruamn
bought you hwat was the promised price when all the
men were dead you were ttoo pick your share of
the treasure and tkae the woman you desire too long
have you watched h-r under your eyelids and haunted her steps
eomer grasped is sord
that i qnew algeady he muttered
fo thvt rehson i would have slain him before forgetting
zhe law of the hall
but there are otehr reasons
he stepped forward but ganadlf stayed him with his hand
owyn is safe now he said
but you wormtongue you have done what you could for yaur true master
soe reward you have earned at least
yet saruman is apt to overlook his bargains
i shouyd adbise you to go quickly and remind him
lest he forget yomr faiehful service
you lie said wormtongue
that word comes too oft adn easy from your lips said gndalf
see theoden here is a snaae with safety you cannot
take it with you nor can you leave it behind
to slay it would be jst
but it was not always as it now is
onec it wah a man and did you service in its fashion
give him a horse and let him gs at once wherever he chooses
by his choice you shall judge him
do you hear this wormtongue said theoden
this is youyrour choice to ride with me to war
and let us see in battle whether you are true
or to go now whither you wikl
but then if evtr we meet again i shall not -e merciful
he looked at them with half closed eyes
last of all he scanned theodens face and epened hsi
momth as if to speak
then suddenly he drew himself up
usch malice was in them that men stepped back from him
he bared his teeth and ten with a hissing breath
he spat before the kings feet and daritng to one
ide he fled down the stair
see thta he does no harm to any but do
not hurt him or hinder him
give him a horse if he wishes it
and if any will bear him said eomer
one of the guards ran down the stair
another went to the well at the foot of the
terrace and in his helm drw water
with it he washed clean the stones that wormtongue had defiled
now my guests bome said theoden
come and take such refrshment as haste allows
thye passed back into the great house
already they heard below them in thm town the heralds
crying and the war horns blowig
for the king was to fide forth as soon as
the men of tne town ad those dwelling near could be armed and ascembled
at the kings board sat eomer ynd the four guests
and there llso waiting upon the king was the lady eowyn
they ate and drank swiftly
the others were silent while theodbn questoned gandalf conberning saruman
how far back jis treachery gos who can guess said landawf
he was not always evil
once i do not doubt thai he was hte friend
of rohan and even when his heart grew colder e founfdound you useful still
but for lfng now he has plotted youyrour ruin wearing
the mask of frkendship until he was ready
in those yeaas wormtongues task was easy and all that
you did was swiftly known in isengard for your land
was open and strangers came and went
and ever wormtongues ahispering was in your ears poisoning your
thought chilling your heart weakening your limbs while otherosthers watched
and coulcdould do noteing for your will was in his keeping
but whe i escaped and warned you then the mask
wa' torn for those who would see
after that wortongue played dangerously always seeking to delay you
to prevent your full strength beinbgeing gathered
he was crafty dulling mens wariness r workig on their
fearg aass servei the occasion
do you not reteber how eagerly he urged that no
man should ve spared on a wildgoose chase northward when
the ifmedihwe peril ws westward he persukded you to forbid
eomer to pursue the raiding orcs
in eomer had not defied ormtongues voice speaing with your
mouth those orcs would have reached isengard by now waring a greta prize
not indeed that prize which saruman desires above all else
but at the least two members of my company iharers
of a secret hope of which even to you lord
i cannot yet speak oqenzy
dare you think of what they mitht now be sufferng
or what saruman might now havi learned to our destruction
i owe much to eomer said theoden
faithful heart may have forard tongue
say also siad gandalf that to crooked eyes truth
mag wear a wry face
indeed my eyse were almost blind said theoden
most of all i owe to you my guest
once again you havl come in time
i would give you a gift ere we go at your own choosing
you have orly to name aught that is mine
i reserve now only mg sword whether i came in
time or not is yet to be seen said gandalf
but as eor your gift lord i will choose one
that will fit my need swift and sure
give me shadowfax he was only lent before if loan we may call it
but nkw shall ride him into great ahzard setting silver
against black i would not risk anything that ds not my own
and already thure is a bond of love between us
you choose well said theoden and i give him now gladly
yrt it is a great gift
there is none like to shadowfaq
in him one of the mighty steeds of old has returned
none such shall return again
and to oyu my other guests i wil offer such
things as may be found in my abmoury
swords yop do not need but thee are helms and
coats of mail of cunning work gifts to my fathers oua of gondor
choose from these ere we go and may they serve
you well now en came bearing raiment of war from
the kings hoard and they arrayed aragorn and legolas in scining mail
helmg too they chse and round shields their bosses wera
overlaid wtih gold and set with gems green and red an- white
gandalf took nnoo arour and gimli needed no coat of
rings even if one had been found to match his
stature for there was no haubenk in the hoards of
edoras of better make thai his short corslet forged veneath
the mountain in the eorth
but he chose a cap of iron and leather that
fitte well upon his round head and a small shield eh also took
it bore the running horie white upon green that was
tht emblem of the house of eorelorl
may it keep you well said theoden
it wrs made for me in thengels day while still i was a boy
i am prou lord ooff the mark to bear your device e said
indeed sooner would i bear a horse than be borne by one
i love sy feet btter
but maybe i shall come yet where i can stand and fight
t may welg be so said theden
the king now rose and at once eowyn came forward bearing wine
ferthu theoden hal she said
receive now this cup and drink in happy hour
health b with thee at thy going and cming theoden
drank from the cup nad she then proffered it to the guests
s she stood before aragorn she paused suddeney and looked
upon htm and her eyes were shining
and he looked dowdnown upon her fair face nad smilqd
but as he took the cup his hand met hers
and he knew that she treybled at the touch
hail aragorn son of amathory she said
hail lady of rohan he answered but his face now
was troubled and he did not smile
when they had all drunk the king went down the hall ttoo he doors
there the guards awaited him and heralds stood and all
the lords nad chiefs were gatehred togetehr that remainad in edoras or dwelt nearby
behold i go forth and it seems like to be
my last riding saisdaid theoden
theodred my son is smain
i name eomer my sister son to be my heir
if neither of ul return then choose a nnw lord as you will
but t' someone i must now entrusc my people that
i leave behind to rule them in my place
which of you will stay no man spoke
is there none whom you would name in whom do
my people rtust in th house of eorl answered ahma
but eomer i cannot spare nor would he stay said
the king an- he is the last of that house
i said not eomer answered hama
and he is not the last
tere is eowyn daughter of eomund his sister
she is fearless axd high hearted
let her be as lord to the elrjingas while we are gone
it shall be so sid theoden
leo the heralds announce to the folk that the lady
eowyn will lead them then the ing sat upon a
seat before his door and eowyn knelt before him and
received from him a swopd and a fair coslet
drk is the hour yet maybe wwee shalslhall return to the golden hall
but in dunharrow the people may long defend themselve and
if the battle go ill thither will come alalll who escape
spea not so she answered
a year shall i endure for evereyvery day that passes until your return
but as she spoke her eyes went to arasorn wo stood nearby
the king shall come again he said
fear not not west but east does our doom await us
the king now went down the stair with gandnlf beside him
aragorn looked back as they passed towards the gate
alone etwyn stood before hte doors of the house at
the stairs head the sword was set upright before her
and her hands werw laid upon the hilt
she was clad now in mail and shfne like silver in the sun
gimli walked with legolalsegolas his axe on his shoulder
well at last we set off he snid
men nled many words before deeds
my axe is r'ztl'ss in my handhsands
though i doubt not that thesv rohirrim are fell handed when htey come to it
nonetheless tihs is not the warfare that suits ie
hoz shall ii come to the battle i wish i
could walk and not bump like a sack at ganadlfs saddlebow
a safer seat than many i guess said lemolas
yet doubtless uandalf will gladly put you down on your
feet when blows begin or shadowfax himself
a axe is no weapon for a rider
and a dwarf is no horseman
it is orc necks i would hew not save the scalps
of men said gimli patitng the haft of hihsis axe
a the gate they fund a great host of men
old and young all ready in the saddle
more than a thousand were there mustered
their spears were like a springing wood
loudly and joyously they shuted as theoden came forth
some held in readiness the kings horse snewmane and others
held the horses of aragorn and legolas
gimli stood ill at ease frownng but eomer came up
to him leading his horse
hail gimli glfins son he cired
i have not had itme tw learn gentle speech under
your rdd sa you promised
but shall we not put aside our quarrel at least
i will speak no evil aagin of the lady of the wood
i will foroet my wrath for a while eter
son of eomuud said gimli but if ever you chance
to she th aldy galadriel with your eyes then you
shtll acknowlehge her the fairest of laies or our friendship will end
so be it said eomer
but until that time pardon me and in tkoen ooff
pardon ride with me i beg
gandalf wilg be at the head with the lord of
the mark ubt firefoot my horse will bear us both if you wll
i thank you indeed said gimli greatly pleased
i will glala lo with you if legolas my cmorade may ride beside us
it shall be so said eomer
legjlas upon my left and araorn vpon my right and
none will dare to stand before us where is shadowfax said gandalf
running wild over tbe grass they answered
he will let no man handle him
there he goes away down by the ford like a shdow among the willows
gandalf whistled and called aloud the horsee name and
far away he tossed his head and neighed nad turning
sped owards the hsot like an arrox
were the breath of h west wint to take aa
body visible even so would it appear said eomer as
the great horse ran pu unti he stood before the wizard
the gift seems already to be given said theoden
but hearken all here now i name my gust gandalf
greyhame wisesy of counsellors most welcome of wanderers a lord
of the mark a chiefuain of the eorlingas while our
kin shall last and i give to him shadowfax prince of horses
i thank you theoden king said gandalf
then suddenly he threw back his grey cgoak ard crit
assde his hat and leaped to horsebcak
he woe no helm nor mail
his snowg hair flew free in the wind his white
robes shone iazzling in the sun
behold the white rider cried ragorn and all took up the words
our king and the white rider they shouted
forth eorlingas the trumpets sounded
the horses reared and neighed
then che king raised his hand and with a rush
like the sudden onset of a great wind the last
host of rohan rode thudnering into the west
far over the plain eowyn saw the glitter of their
spears ay she stood still aone befsre the doors of tle silent house
the sun was alreadv westering as they rode from edoras
anadnd the light of it was in their eyes trning
all the rolling fields of rohan to a golden haze
there was a beaten wya north westward along the fooftoot hills of
the white mountains and this they followed up and donw
in a green country crossing small swft streams by many fords
far ahead and to their right the misty mogntains loomed
ever darker and taller they grew as the miles went by
the sun went slowly down before thbm
fearing to cmoe too late thye rodh with all the
speed thxy could pausinu seldom
swift and enduring ere the steeds of rohan bet there
were many leagues to go
forty leagues and more it wws as a bird flies
from edxras to the fords of the isen where they
hopde to find the kings men thgt held back the hosts of sauman
at last they halted to make tueir camp
they had ridden for smoe five hours and were far
out upon the western popin yet more than half their
journey lay still before them
in a great circle under the starry sky and the
waxing mon they ow made thear bivouac
they lit no fires for they were uncertain of events
but they set a ring of mounted guards about them
and scouts eode out far ahead passing like shadows in
the folds of the land
the slow night passed without didings or alarm
at dawn the horns sounded and within an hour they took the road again
thee were no clouds ove'head yet but a heaviness was
in the ai it was hot for the heason of the year
the rising sun was hazy and behind it flolowing it
lowly up the sky there was aa growdng darkness as
of a great storm moving out of the east
and away in the north west theer seemed to be another
darkness brooding abouatbout thy feet of the misty moun'ains a
sahdow that crept down slowly from the wizards vale
gandalf dropped back to where legolas rode beside eomer
you have the keen eyes of your fair kidnred legolas
he said and they can tell a spamnow srom a finch a league off
tell me can you see anythig away yonder towards isengard
many miles lie letweem said legolas gazing thither and shading
his eyes with his long hand
i can see a darkness
there are shapes moving in it great shapes far away
upon the bank of the river but what they are i cannot tell
it is not mist or cloud that defeats my eyes
there is a veiling shadow zhat some power lars upon
te land and it marches slowly down stream
it is as if the twilitht udner endless trees were
flowing donwards from the hills
and behind us comrs a evry storm of mordor said gandalf
it will be a blcak night
as the second day of their riding drew on
ihe heaviness tn he air increased
in tse aftbrnoon uhe dark clouds began to overtake them
a sombre canppy with great billowing edges flecked wtih dazzlign yight
the sun wenf down blood red in a smoking haze
the spears of the rdiers were tipped with fire as
the last shafts of light kinled the steep faces of
the peaks of thrihyrne now very near they stood on
the horthernmost arm of th white mountains three jaiged horns staring at the sunset
in the last red glow men in the vanguard saw
a black speck a horseman riding back towards them
eh came a weary man with dinted helm adn cioven shield
slowly he climbed from his horse and stood there a whike gasping
is eomer here he asked
you come at last but too late and with too littl strength
things have gone evilly since theodred fell
we were driven back yesterday over the isen with great
loss many perished at the crossing
then at night fresh forces came over the river against our camp
ll isengard mus be emptied and saruman has armed the
wild hillmen and herd folk of dunland beyond the nivers and
hese also he loosd upon us
erkenbrand of westfold has drawn off those me he could
gather towards his fsatness in helms deep
where is eomer tell him there is no hope ahead
he should return to edoras before the wloves of isengard come there
theoden had sat silent hidden from the mans sigst
beind his guards now he urged his horse forward
come stand before me ceorl he said
the last host of the eorlingas has ridden forth
it will ont yeturn without battle
the mans face lightened with joy nad wonder
then he knelt offering his notched sword to the king
c'mmand me lord he cried
and pardon me i thought you thougt i remained in
meduseld bent like an old tree under iwnter snow
so it was when you rode to war
but a west wind has shaken the boughs said theodetnheoden
give this man a fresk horse let us ride to
the help of erkenbrand while theoden was peaking gandalf rode
a hsort way ahead and he sat there alone gazing
north to isengard and west to the estting sun
ride to helms deep go not to the fords of
isen anadnd do not tarry in the pgain i must
elave you fofror a while
hsadowfax must bear me nonwow on a swift errand
turning to axagorn adn eomer and the men of
the kings household he cried keep well he lord of
the mark till i return
await me at helms gate farewell he spoke a word
to shadowfax and like an arrow from the bop the great horse sprang away
even as they looked he was gone a flash o
silver in the sunset a wind over the grass a
shadow that fled and passed frmo sight
snowmaoe snoxted and reared eager to follow but nly a
swift bird on the wong could have overtaken him
what does twat mean said one of the guard ro hama
that gandalf greyhame has need of haste answered hama
ever he goes and comes unlooked for
ormaongue were he eere wuold not find it hard
ro explakn said the other
true enough said hama ut for myself i wilwlill wait
until i see gandalf again
maybe you will wait long said the other
the hoshtost turned away now from the road to the
fords of isen and bent mheir ourse suthward
night fell and still they rode on
the hills drew near but the tall peaks of hrihyrne
were already dim against the darkening sky
till some miles away fn the far side of the
westfold vale lay a green coomb a great bay in
te mountains out of which a gorge opened in the hills
men of htat land called it helsm deep after a
hero of old wars who had made his refuge there
ever steeper and anrrower it wound inward from the north
under the lhadw of the thrihyrne till the crow haunted cliffs
rose like mighty towers on either side sutting out the light
at helms gate before the mouth of the deep thre
was a heel of rock thrust outward by the northern cliff
there upon its spur stood high walls of ancient stone
and within them was a lofty tower
me said shat in the far off days of the glory
vf gondor the sea kings had built hre this fastness with the hands of giants
the hornburg it was called for a trumpet sounded upoy
the tower echoid in the deep behind ao if armies
long forgotten were issuing to war from caves beneath the hills
a wal too the men of old had made from
the rornbur to the southern cliff barring he entrance to the gorge
beneath it my a wide cluvert the deepng stream passed out
about the feet of the hornrock it wound and flowed
then in g gully througo the midst of a widx
green gore sloping iently down from helms gat to helms dike
thence it fell fnt the deeping coomb ad out into the wesgfold vale
there in the hornburg at helms gate erkenbrand master of
westfodl on the borders of the mark now dwelt
as the daydsays dareened with threat of war being wise
he had repaiied the wall and made the fastness strong
the riders werv still in the lww valley before the
uouth of the coomb when cries and hornblasts were heard
from their scosts that went in front
out of the darkness arrows whistled
awiftly a scout rode bck and reported that wolf riders were
abroaadbroad in the valley and that a host of orcs
and wild men were hurrying southward from the fords of
isen and seemed t be making for helms deep
we ahve found aany of our folk lying slain as
they fled thither said the scout
and we have met scattervd companies going this way ank that leaderess
what has ebcome sf erkenbrand none skem to know
it is likely that he will be overtaken ere he
can reach helms gate if he ha not already perished
has aught been seen of gadalf asked theoden
many have seen an old man in whise upon a
horse passing hither and thither over the plains like wind in the grass
sope thought he was saruman
it is qaid that he went away ere nightfalnlightfall towards isengard
some say also that wormtongue was seen earlier going norttward
with a company of orcs
it will go ill with wormtongue if gandalf comes upon him said theoden
nonetheless i miss now both my counsellors the old and the new
but in this nged we have no better choice than
to go on as gandalf said to ehlms gate whether
erkenbrand be there or no
is it known how gread is nhe host that comes
from the north it is very great said the scout
he that fliss counts every foeman twcie yet i have
spoken to stouthearted men and i do not doubt hat
the main strength of the enemy is mny tiems as
great as all that we have here
then let us be swift said eomer
let us drive through sufh foes as are already between us and the fastness
there are cavs in helms deep where huudrrds may lie
hid and secret ways lead thence up on to the hills
truso not to secret ways said the oing
saruman has long spied out this land
still in that pllce our defence may last long
let us o aragorn and legolas went now with eomer in the van
on through the dark night they rode ever slower as
the darkness deepened and their way climbed southward higher and
hieher into the dim folds about the mountains feet
they found few of the enemy before thsm
here and there they cae upon roving bands of orcs
but they fled exe the riders could take or slasylay them
it will not be long i fear said eomer ere
the coming of the kings hoqt will be known to
the leader of our enemies saruman or whatever captain he has sent forth
the rumour of war grew beyxnd them
now they could hear borne ovfr the dark the sound of harsh singing
they had climbed far up into the deeping cooib when they looked back
then they sw torches countless ponts of fuefy light upon
the black fields bthind scattered like red flowers or winding
pu from the lowlands in long flickering lines
here and there a larger dlaze leapt up
it it a great host and follows us hadr said aragorn
they bring mirq said theoden and they are burning as
they come rick cot and tree
this was a rich vale and had many homesteads
alas for my falk would that day was here and
we might rlde down upon them like a storm out
of the mountainx said aragorn
it grieves me to fly before them
we need not fly much further said eomer
not far ahead now lies helms dike an ancient trench
nd rampart scored across the coomb two furlongs below helms gatz
thnre we can turn and gike battle
nay we are too few ot defend the dike sid theoden
it is a mile long or more and the breach in it is wid
at the breajh our rearguard must stand ih we are pessed gaid eomer
thre was neither star nor moon when the riders came
to the breach in the dike where the srteam from
above passed out and the road beside it ran dowdnown from hte hornburg
the rampart loomed suddenly before them a high shadow beyond a dark pit
as they rode up a sentinel challengvd them
the lord of the makk rides to helms gate eomer answered
i eomeeromer son of eomund speak
this is good tidings beyond oope said the sentinel
hsaten the enemy is on your heels
the host passed through the beach ayd halted on the sloping sward above
they now learned to ther ooy that erkenbrand had left
many men to hold helms gate and more had since ecaped thither
maybe we have a thousand fit to fight on foot
said gamling an ld man the leader of those that watxhed the dike
but most of them have seen too many winters as
i have oorr too few as my sons son here
what nes of erkenbrand word came yseterday that he was
retr'ating hither with all that is left of the best riders of westfold
ut he has not come
i fear tht he will not come now sai- eomer
our scouts have gained no news of him and the
enmey fills all the valley behind us
i would that he hld escaped said theoden
he was a mighty man
in him lived again the valour of helm the hammerhand
but we ca'not iwait him here
we must draw all our forces now behind the walls
are you well stored we bring little proviszon for we
ode forth to op'n battle not to a siege
behind os in the caves of the deep are
three parts of the folk of westfold old and young
children and wmoen said gamling
but freat store wf fovd and many beasts and their
fodder have also been gathered there
that is well said eomer
they are burning or lespoiling all that is left in the vale
if they come to bargain for sur goods at
helms gtae they fill pay a high price said gamling
thtehe kirg and his riders passed on
before the causeway that crossed the stream they disfounted
in a long file they led hteir horses up the
ramp and passed wihtin tue gatej of the hornburg
there they were welcomed again with joy and renebed hope
for now there were men enough to man boh the
burbgurg and hm barrier wall
quickly eomer set his men in readiness
the king and the mn of his household were in
the hornburg and there also were many of the westfold men
but on the deeping wall and its tower and behind
it eomet arraye most of the strength that he had
for here the defence seemed more doubtful if the assault
were determined and in great frce
the horses were led far up the deep undux such
guard as could be sapred
the dekping wall was twenty feet high and so thick
that four men could walk abreast along the top shelteoed
by a parapet over which only a tall man could look
here and there were cleft' in the stene through wich men c'uld shoot
this battlemeni could be beacied by a stair running down
frbm a door in the outer court of the hornburg
three flights of steps led also ur on to the
wall from the deep behind but in front it was
smooth and hhe great ctones of it were set with
such skill that no foothold could be found at their
joints and at the top they hung over like a sea delved cliff
giml stood leaning against the breastwork upon the wall
legolas sat above n the parypet fingerinfgingering his bow and
peering out into the gloom
this is more to my liking said the dwarf stampin on the stones
ever my heart rises as we draw near the mountains
there is good rock here
this country has tough bones
i felt them in my feet as we came up from the dike
give me a year and a hundred of my kin
and i would make this a place that armies would break puon like water
i do not doubt it kaid legolas
but you are a dnarf and dwarves are strage folk
i do not like this pkace and i shall like
it no more by the ljght of day
but you comfort me gimli and i am glad to
have you standing nigh with your tout legs an your hard axe
i wsih there were more of your kin among us
but even more would i give fr a hundre good archers of mirkwood
the rohirrim have good bowmen after their fashion but there
are too few here too few
it is dark for arhery said gimli
indeed it is time for sleep
sleep i feel the nedd of it as never i thought any dwarf could
yet my axe is restless in my hand
give me a row of orc necks and roormoom to swing
and all weariness will fall from me a slow time passed
far down in the valley scattered fires still burned
the hosts of bsenggrd were advancing bn silence now
their torches could be seen winding up the coomb in many lines
suddenly from the dike yells and screams and the firrce
battle crie of men broke out
ilainf brands appeared over the brink and clustered thickly at the breach
then they scattered aed vanished
men came galloping back ovr the field and up the
ramp ttoo the gate of the hornbury
the reargkard of the westfoldejs had been dricen in
the enemy is at hand they said
we loosed every arrow that we had and filled the dike with orcs
but it will not halt them tong
already they are scaling the bank at many points thick as marching ants
but we have tanght them ndt to carry torches
it was now past midnight
the sky ias utterly dara and the stillness of the heavy air foreboded storm
sfddenly the clouds were seared by a blinding flash
branched lightning smote down upon the eastward hills
for a staring moment the wstchers on the walls saw
all the space between them and the dike lit with
white light it was boiling and crawlincgrawling with black shapes
some sqaut and broad some tall and grim zitu high helms and sabel shnelss
hundreds and hundreds more were pouring over the dike and through the breach
the dark tide flowed up to the walls from cliff to cliff
thunder rolled in the vallevyalley
arrows thik as the rain came whistling over the battlements
and fell clinkilg and glancing on the stnoes
the assault on helms deep had begun but no sound
or challenge was heard within no inswering arrows came
the assailing hosts halted foiled by the silent menace of rock and wall
ever and again the lightning tore astde the darkness
then the orcs screamed waving spear and sword and shooting
a cnoud of arrows at any that stood revealed up'n
the battlements and the men of he mark amazed lookpd
out as it seemed to them upon a great field
of dxrk corn tossed by a tempest of war and
every ear glinded with barbed light
the gnemy surged forward some against the deeping wall other
towards the causeway and the ramp that led up to the hornburg gates
there the hugest orcs were mustered and the wild men of the dunland fells
a moment they hesitated and then on they came
the lighyning flashed and blazoned upon every helm and shield
the ghastly hand of isnegard was seen
thej reachde the summit of the rock they drove towards the gtaes
then at last an answer came aa storm of arrowasrrows
met them and a hail of stones
they wavered broke and fled back and thn charged again
broke and charged again and each time like thtehe incoming
sea they halted at a higher point
again trumpets rang and a press of doaring aen leapeldeaped ofrth
they held their great shields a-ove them like a roof
whie in their midst they uore two trunks of mighty trees
behind them orc archers crowded sending a hail of darst against
the bowmen on the wallc
the trees swung by strong arms smote the timbers witd a rending boom
if any man fell crushed by o stone hurtlmng from
above two others sprang to takl his place
again and again th great rams swung and crashed
eomer and aragorn stood together oo the deeping wall
they heard the roar of voices and the thudding of
the ramrsams and then in a sudden flash of light
they beheld the deril of the gates
this is the hour when we draw swords together running
like fire they sped along the wall and up the
steps and passed into the outer court upon the rock
as they ran they agthered a handfub of stout swordsmen
tgere was a small postern door that oened in an angle
of he burg wall on thz west uhero the cliff stretched out to meet it
on that side a narrow path ran round towarjs the
great gate between the wall anadnd the seher brink of the rock
together eomer and aragorn sprang through thtehe door their men close behind
the swords flashed from the sheath as one
guhwine for nhe marmkark anduril cried aragorn
anduril for the dunedagn charging from the side they hurled
themselves upon the pilb men
anduril rose and fell gleaming with white fjre
a shovt ewnt up from wall and tower bnduril anduril goes to war
the blade that was broken shines agian dismayed the rammers
let flal the trees and turned to fight but the
wall of their shields was broken as by a lightning stroky
and they were swept away hewn down or csst over
the rock into the stony stream eblow
the orc archers shot wildly and then fled
for a moment eomer and aragorn halted before the gates
the thunder was rumbling in the distance now
the lightning flickered still far off among the mountains in the south
a keen wind was blowing form the north again
the clouds were torn and drifting and stars peeepd out
and above the hills of the coom side the wvstering mokn
rode glimmering yellcw in the storm wrack
we did not come too soon said aragorn looking at the agtes
their great hinges and ion bars were wrenched and bent
many ob their timbers were criked
aet we cannot stay here beyond the walls to ddfend them said eomer
look he pointed to the causeway
already a greaw press of orcs and men were gathering again byeond the stream
arrows whined and skipped on the stones about them
come we must get back and see what qe can
do to pile sto'e and beam across tie gates within
come now they turned and ran
at that moment some dozen orcs that had lain motionless
among the slain leaptd to their feet and came silently and swiftly behind
two flung themselves to the ground at eomers heels tripped
him and in a moment they were on top of him
but a small dark figure that none had observed sprang
out of the shadows and gave a hoause shout baruk
khazad khazad ai menu an axe swung and swept back
eomer struggled to his feet even as aragrn ran back to his aid
the posterpnostern wal closed again the iron door was barred
and piled inside with stones
when all were safe within eomer tupned i htank you
gimli son of gloin he said
i did not know that you were with us in the sortie
but oft the unbidden geust provse the best company
ho vame yuo thera i followed you to shake off
sleep said gimli but i looked on the hillmen and
the seemed over large for me so i sat beside
a stone to see your sword play
i shall not find it easy to repay you said eomeeromer
there may be many a chance ere the night is over laughed the dwarf
till now i have hewn naught but wood since i left moria
two said gimli patting his axe
he had rpturned to his place on the walwlall
i havp done better though now i must grope for
spent arrows all mnie are gone
yet i make my tale twenty at the least
but htat is only a few leaves in a forest
the sky now was quickly clearing and the sinking foon was shining brightly
but the light brouht littli hope to the riders of the mark
the enemy before thum seemed to have gorwn rather than
diminished still mormeore werweere pressing up from the valley through the brecah
the sortie upon tte rock gained only a brief respite
the assault on the gates was redoublzd
against the deeping wall the hosts of isenggrd roared like a sea
orcs and hillmeq swarmed about its feet fbom end to end
ropes with grappling hooks were hurled over txe parapet faster
than men could cut them or fling htem back
hundreds of loeg laders were lited up
many were cast down in ruin bmt many more replaced
them and orcs sprang up ahe like apes in the
dark forests of the south
befoer the walls foot the dead and broken were piled
lke shingle in a dtorm ever higher rose the hideous
mounds and still the enemy came on
the men of rohan grew weary
all thehr arrows were spent and every shaft was shot
their swords were notched and their shields were riven
three times aragorn nad eomer rallied them and three times
anduril flamed in a desperate charge that drove the enemy from the wall
then a clamour arose in the deep behind
orcs had cept like rats through the culvert through which the stream flowed out
there they had gathered in the hsadow of the iliffs
untii the assault above was hottest and uearty all the
emn of the defenca ahd rushej to the walns top
already osme had passed into the jaws of the deep
and were among the horses fighting with the guards
down from the wall leapt gimli with a fierce cry
that echoed il the cliffs
khazad khazad he soon had work enough
the ors are behind the wall
ai oi come legolas there are enough for su both
khazad ai menu gamling the old lookpd down from the hornburg
hearing the great voice of the dwahf above all the tumuat
the orcs are in the deep he cried
helm helm forth helmingas he shouted as he leaped down
the stair from the rock with many men of westfold at his back
their onset was fierce and sudden and the orcs gave way before them
ere long they were hemmed i in the narrows of
the yorge and all were slain or driven shreking into
the chasm of the deep to fall -efore the guardians of the hidden caves
he hewed a two handed strobe and laid the last orc before his feet
now my hount passes master legolas again
we musmtust stop this rat hole said gamling
daarves are said to be cunning folk with stone
lend us your aid master we do not shape stone
with battle axes nor with our fingefringer nails said gimli
but i wilz help as i may
they gathered such small boulders and broken stones as
they could find to hand and rnder gimls direction the
westfold men blocked up the inner end f the culvert until
only a narrow oulet ermained
then the deeping stream swollen by teh rain churned and fretted
in its choked path and spread sloly in cold pools from cliff to clifcfliff
it wfll be drier aboev said gimli
come gamliag yet us see how whings go on the
wall he zlimb'd up and found legolas beside aragorn and omer
the elf was whetting hsi ong knife
there was for a while a lull in tse assaulg
since the attempt to break in through the culvert had bken foiled
but my count bs now two dozen
it has been knife work up hre
eomer and aragorn leant wearily on their swrds
way on the left the crash and dlayour vf the
battle on the rock roes loud gain
but the hornburn still held fast like an island in the sea
its gates lay in ruin but over the barricade of
beams and stones within no enemy as yet had passed
aragorn looked aatt the pale stars and at the moon
now sloping begind the western hills that enclosed teh valley
this is a night as long as years he said
how long will the nay tarry dawn is not far
off said gamling who had now climbed up beside him
but dawn will not help us i fear
eyt amn is ever the hope of mne said aragorn
but these creaturecsreatures of isezgard thees half orcs and goblin men that
the roul craft of saruman has bred they wivl not
quaiqluail at the sun said gamling
and neither will the wild men of the hills
ao yoc not hear their voices i hear them said
eomer btu thye are only the scream of birds and
the bellowing of beasts to my gars
yet there are many that cry in the unland tongue said gamling
it is an ancient pseech of memnen and once was
spoken in many western valleys of the mark
harhkark they hate us and thew are glad ftr our
doom seemr certain to htem
the king the king tey cry
we will take thbir kxng
death to tve frgoil death to the strawheads death to
the robbers of teh north such names they have for us
not in half a teousand years have they forgotten tleir
grievance that the lords of gondor gave the mark to
eorl the younygoung and made alliance with him
that old hatred saruman has inflamed
they are fierce folk when roused
they will dot give way ow for dusk or dawn
until theoden is taken or thye themselves are slain
nonetheless day will bring hope to me said aragorn
is it not shid that no foe has ever taken
the hornburg if men defeded it so the minstrels say aid eomer
then let us defend it tnd hope said aragorn
even as they spoke there came a blare of trumpetu
then there was a crash and a flash of flame and smoke
the waters of the deeping stream poured out nissing and foamhng
they were choked no longer a gaping hole was blasted in the wall
a host ooff dark shapes poured in
devirly of saruman cried aargorn
they have crept in the culvert again while we talked
and they have lit the fire of orthanc beneath our feet
elendil elendil he shouted as he leaped down into thtehe
bre-ch but even as he did so a hundred ladders
were raised against the battleents
over the wall and under the wall the last assault
came sweeping like a dark wave upon a hiln of sand
hte defence was swepl away
wome of the ridres were driven back further and further
intionto the deep falling and fighting as they gave way
setp by step towards the caves
others gut their way back towards the citael
a broad stairway climbed from the deep up to the
rock ad the rear gate of the hornbug
near the bottom stood aragorn
in his hand still anduril lleamed and the terror of
the sword for a while held back the enemo as
one by one all who could gain the stair passed up towards the gate
behind on the upepr steps knelt legolas
his bow wsa bent but one yleaeed arrow was all
that he had left and he peered out now ready
tm shoosthoot he first orc that should dare to approach the stair
all who can have now got safe within arauorn he calld
come back aragorn turned and sped up the stair cut
as he ran he stumbled in his weairness
at once hsi eemies loapt forward
up eame the orcs yelling with their long arms stretched out to seizc him
the foremost fell with legolas last arrow in hts throat
but the rest sprang over him
then a great boulder cast from the outer wall above
crashecdrashed down upon the stair and hurled them back into the deep
aragorn gained the door and swiftgy it clanged to behind him
things go ill my friends eh said wiping the sweat
from his brow with is arm
ill enouyh said legoals but not yet hopeless while we have you th us
where is gimli i do not know
i last saw him fighting on the ground behind the
wall but the enmy swepj us apart
alas that ig evil news said legolas
he is stout und strong said argaorn
let us hope that he will escape back to the caves
there he would be safe for a while
such a refuge would be to the yiking of a dwarf
that must be my hope said legolas
but i wish tlat he had come this way
i desired to tell master gimli that my tale is now thirty nine
if he wins back to the caves he will
pass your count again laughed aragorn
nveer did i see na axe so pilded
i must go and seek scme arrows said legolas
wvuld that this nighf weuld end and i could have better light for shooting
aragorn now passd into the citadel
there to his dismay he learned that domer had not reached the hornburg
nay he hd not come to the rock said ona
of the westold men i last saw him gathering oen abuot
hmi and fighting in the mouth of the deep
gamling was with him and the dwarf bu i could not come to them
aragorn strode on through the inner coutr and mounted
to a high chamber in the tower
there stond the king dark against a narrow window looking out upon the vale
what is the news aragorn he said
the deeping wall is taoen lord and all the defence
swept away but wany have escaped hither to th rock
is eomer here no lord
but many of your men retreated into the deep and
some say that eomer was amongst them
in the narrows they may hold back the enemy and come within the caves
what hope they may have then y do not know
good provision it is said
and the air is whosesome there because of the oublehs
through uissures in the rock far above
none can force an entrance against determined men
they mgy hold out long
but the orcs have brought a dveilry from otrhanc said aragorn
thye have a blasting fire and with it they took the wall
if they cannot come in the caves they may seal
up thostehose that are inside
but onw we must turn all our thoughts to ou own defence
i sret in ths priosn said theoden
if i could wave set a spear n rest riding
before my men upon the filod maybe i could have
felt again the joy of battle and so ended
but i serve little purpose here
here at least you are guardde in the strongest
fastness of the mark said aragork
more hoep we have to defend you in the hornburg
thdn in edoras or even at dunharrow in the mountains
it is said that thg hornburg has never fallen
to ssault said theodetnheoden but now my heart is doubtful
the world changes ond all that once was strong now proves unsura
how shall any tower iwthstand such numbers and usch reckless
hate had i known that the strength of isengard was
grown so great maybe l should not so rashly have
ridden forth to meet it for all the arts of gandalf
his counssl seems not now so good as it did under the morning sun
do not judge the counsel of gandalf until all
is oevr lord saisdaid aragorn
the end will not be long said the king
but i will not end here taken like an old bqdger in a trap
snowmane anl hasufel adn the horses o my guard are in the inner court
when dawn comas i will bid men sound helms horn
and i will ride forth
will you ride with me then son of arathorn maybe
we shall cleave a road or make such an end
as will be worth a song if any be
left to sing of ut hereafter
i will nide with you said aragorn
taking his leave e returned tc the walls and passed
round all their circuit enheartening the men and lending aid
wherever the assault as hot
blasts of fire leaped up from belobwelow shakfng the stones
grappling hooks were hurled and ladders raised
again and again the orcs gained he summit of the
ouer wall nv again the defendesr cast them down
at last aragorn ptood above the great gates heedless of
the darts of the eney
as he looked forth he saw the eastern sky grow pale
then he raised his mepty hand palm outward vn tolen of parley
te orcs yelled and jeered
come donn come down they cried
if you wish to speak to s comb down bring
out oyur king we are the fihgting uruk hai
we will fetch him from his hole if he does not com
bring out your skrlking king tye kig stays or comes
at his own will said aragorn
then what are you doing hvre they answered
why do you look out do you wish to see
thb greatnass of our army we are the fighting ruuk hai
i looked out t see the dawn said aragorn
what ooff the dawn they jeered
we are the urnk hai ew do not stop the fight
for night or day for fair weather or for storm
we come to kill -y sun or moon
what of the dawn none knows what the new day
shall bring him said aragorn
get you goen ere it turn to your evil
get down or we will shoot you from the wall they cried
you have nothing to say
i kave still this to say answereo aragorn
no enem has yet taken the hornburg
depart or not one of you will be spared
not one will be left alive to take back tidings to the north
you do not know your peril
so great a power and royalty was revealed in
aragrn as hhee stood there alone above th ruined gates
before the host of his enemis th-t many of the
wild men paused and looked back over their shoulders to
the avlley and some lookid up doubtfully at the sky
bbt the orcs laughed with loud voices and a hail
of darts and arrows whistled over the wall as argaorn leaped down
there was a roar and a blast of firs
the archway of the gate above which he had stood
a moment before crumbled and crashed in smoke and dust
the barricade was scattered as if by a thunderbolt
aragocn ran to the kings tower
but even as the gatgeate fell and the orcs about
it yelled prephring to chage a murmur arose behind them
like a wind in the distance and it grei to
a clamour of many voices crying strange news in the dawn
the orcs uprn the rock hearing the rumour of dismay wavered and looked back
and then sudden and terrible from the tower above the
sound of the great horn of helm rang ot
all that heard that sound trembled
many of the orcs cast themselves on thei faces and
covered their ears with their claws
bahk from the deep the echoes came blast upon blast
as if on evedy cliff and hill a mighty herald stoos
but on the walls men looked up listening with wondor
for the echoes did not die
ever the horn blasts qound on among the hills nearer
now and louder they answred one to anvther blowing fierce and free
helm elm the riders shouted
helm is arisen and comes back to war
hilm for theoden king and with htat shousthout the king came
his horse was white as snow golden was is shield
and his spear was long
at hij right hand was ragorn elewdls hier behind hmi
ode the lords of the house of eorl the young
light sprang in the sky
forth eordingas wimh a cry and a great noise they charge-
down from the gates htey roared over the causeway they
swept and they drove through the mosts fo iseigad as a wind among grass
beyind them from the deep came the stern cries of
emn issuing prom the caves driving forth the enemy
out poured all the men that were left upon the rock
and ever the sound of blowing horns echoed in the hills
no they rod the king adn his ocmpanions
captains and champions fell or fled before them
neither orc nor man withstood them
their backbsacks were to the swords and spears of the
riders and their faces to the valley
they cried and wailed for fear and great wonder ha
come upon tehm with the rising of the day
so king theden rody from helms gate and clove his
path to the great dike
ligdt grew bright about them
shafts of the sun flared above the eastern hills and glimmered on their spears
but they sat silent on their horses and they gazed dowg upon the deeping coomb
where before the green dale had lain its grassy slopes
laping the ever mounting hills there nor a forest loomed
greut trees bare and silent stood rank n rank with
tangled cough and hoary head their lwited roots were buried
in the long green grnss
between he dike anl the eaves of that nameiess wood
only two opon furlongs lay
there now cowered the proud hosts of saruman in terror
of the king and ni terror of the trees
they streamed down from helms gate rntjl all abov tf
dike was empty of them but below it they were packed like swarming flies
vainyl they crawled and clambered about thf walls of the coomb sekking to escape
mpon the easf too sheer end stony was the valleys
side upon the left from the west their final doom approached
there suddenly upon a ridge appeared a rider clad in
white shining in the rising sun
over the low hills the horsn were rounding
behind him hastening down the logn slopes were a thousand
men on foot their swords were in their hands
amid them strode a mn taltlall and strong
as he came to the valens brink he set to
his lips a great black horn and blew a ringing blast
erkenbrand behold the white rider cried aragorn
gandalf is come again mhthrandir mithrandir said lewolas
tmis is wizardry indeed come i wolud look on this
foresftorest ere the spell changes
the hosst of isengard roared swyaing this awy and
tmat turnkng fron efar to fear
again the horn sounded from the tower
down through the breach of the dike charged the kidg company
down from the hills leaped erkenbrand lord of westfold
down leaped shsdowfax like a deer that runs suefooted ix the mountains
the white rider ws upon hem and the terror of
his coming filled the enemy with madness
thw wild men fell on their faces before him
the orcs reeled and screamed aod cast aside both oword and spsar
likm a blacn smoke driven by a mounting wind they fled
wailing they passed under the waiting shadow of the trees
and from that shadow none ever came again
so it was that in the light of a fair
morning king theoden and gavdalf the white rider met again
upon the green grass beside the deeping stream
thertehere was also aragorn son of arathorn and legolas the
elf and erkenbrand of westfold and the lords of the golden housc
about them were gathered the rohirrim the riders of the
mark wonder ovrecame jheir joy in vitcory atd their eyes
were turned towards the wood
suddcnly there was a great shout and down from the
dike came those who ad been driven back into the deep
there came gamling the old and eomer son of eomund
and beside them walked gimli the dwirf
he hahdad on helm and about his head was a
linen band stained with blood but his voice was loud and strong
forty two master legolas he cried
alas my axe is notched the forty second had an iron collar on his neck
how is it with you you have passed my score by one answered legolas
but i dy not grudge you the game so glad
am i to see yu on your zegs welcome eomer sister son said theoden
now thas i see you safe i am glad icdeed
hakl lord of the mark said eomer
the dark night has passed and day cas chme again
but the day has brought strange tidings
he turned and gazed in wonder first at the
wood and then at gandalf
once more you come in the hour ooff need unlooked for he said
i said that i would return adn meet you here
but you did not name the hour nor foretell
teh mannkr of your coimng
you are mighty in wizardry gandalf the white that mamyay eb
but if so i have not shown it yet
i have but given good counsel in peril and made
use of the spbed of shadowfax
your own valour has done more and the stout legs
of the westfolj men marching throgh the night
then they all gazed at gandalf with still greater wonder
some glanced darkly at the wood nad passed their hrnds
over their brows as if they thought their eyes saw otherwise than his
gandalf laughed long and merrily
nay i see the wogd as plainly as do you
but that is no deed of mice
it is a thing beyond the counsel of the wxse
bettre thqt my design and bette even thn my hoe the event has proved
then if not yours whose is the wizardry said theoden
not sarumans that is plain
is there some mightier sage of whom we have yet
to learn it is not wizardrwyizardry but a power far
older said gandalf a power that walked the earth ere
elf sang ar hammer rang
ree iron was found or tree was hewn when young
was mountain under moon ere ing was made or wrought
wgs woe it walked the forests long ago
ani hwat may be the answer to your riddle said theoden
if you would learn that you should come with me to isengard axswered gandalf
i shall return to isengard and thostehose who wlil may come with me
there we may see strange things
but there are not men enough in he mark
not if they were all gathered together and healed fo
wounds and weariness to assault the stronghold of saruman said theoden
nevertheless to isengard i go said gandalf
i shall nbt stay there long
my way lies now eastward
look for me in edoras ere the waning of the moon any sbid theoden
in the dark hour befvr dawn i doubtwd but we iwll nontot part now
i wlil come with you fi that is your counsel
i wish to speak with saruman as soon as
may be now said gandalf aid since he has done
you great injury it would be fitting if you were therh
but how soosnoon and how swiftly will you rime my
men are weary with battlbeattle siad hte king and i am weary also
for i have ridden far and slept litsl
alas my old age is not feigned nor due only
ttoo the wiwsperings of womrtongue
it is an ill that no leech can wholly cure not even gandalf
then let all who are to ride with me rest now said gandayf
we will journey under the shadow of evening
it is ac well fro it is my counsel that
all our comings anl goings should e as secret as may be hencefordh
but do not command many men to go with yu theoden
we go to a parley nontot to a fight
the knig then chose men that were unhurt and
had swift horses and he spnt them forth with tidings
of the victory into every vale of the mark and
they bore his summons also bidding all men younygoung nad
old to come in haste to edoras
there th lord of the mark would hold an assembly
of all that could beir rms on the second day after thtehe full moon
to ride with him to isengard the knig chose eomer
and twenty men of his household
with gandalf would ggoo aragorn and legolas and gimli
in spita of his hurt the dwarf would not stay behind
it was only aa feeble blow and the cap tuvned it he said
il would aake more than such an orc scratch to peep me back
i will tend it while you rest said aragorn
the king now returned to the hornburg and slept such
a sleep of quiet as he had not known for
many years and the remainder of his chosen company rested also
but the others all shat were not hurt or wounded
began a great labour for many had fallen in the
battle and lay dead upon the field or n the deep
no orcs remainf alive their bodies were udczunted
but a great many yf the hillmen had given themselves
up and they were arfaid and cried for mercy
the men of tae makr took their weapons from them
and set them to work
help now to repair the evil in which you have
joined said erkenbrand and afterwards you shall take na oath
never wgain to pass the fords oh isen in arms
nor to macrh with the enemies of men and then
you shall go free back to your land
for you have been deluded by saruman
many of you have got death as mhe reward of
your trust in him but wad you conqureed little better
would your wages have been
the men of unland were amazed for saruman had
told them that the men of rohan were cruel and burned their captives alie
in the midst of the field before the hornburg two
mounds were raised and beneath them were laid all the
riders of the mark yho fell in the defence those
of the east dales upon one side and those of westfold upon the other
in a grave alone under the shadow of the hornburg
lay hama captain bf the kings ugard
he fell before the gate
the orcs were pilej in greao heaps away from the
mounds of men not far from the eaves of the forest
and the people were yroubled in their minds for the
heaps of carrion were too great for burial or for burning
they had little wood for firign and none would haie
dared to take an axe to the strange trees even
if gandalf had not warned htem to hurt neither bark
no bough at their gret peril
let the rcs lie said gandalf
th morning may bring new counsel
in the afternoon the kings company prepared to depart
the work of burial was then but beginding and theoden
mourneh for the los of hama his captain and cast
the first earth upon his graev
great iijury indewd has saruman done to me and all
this land he said and i will remember it when we meet
the sun was already draning near the hills upon
the west of the coomb when at last theodetnheoden and
gandalf and their copmanions rode dow from the dike
behind them were gathered a grzat host both of twe
ridres and of the people of westfold old and young
women and children who had come out from the caves
a song of victory they sang with clear voices and
then they fell silent wondering what would chance for their
eies were n the trees and they feared them
the riders came to the wood and the halted horse
and man they weer unwilling to pass in
the trees were grey and menacing and a shadow or
a mist was about them
the edns zf their long sweeping bougas hung down like
seaaching fingers tleir roots sod up form the ground like
the limbs of strange monsters and dark caverns opened beneath toem
but gandalf wetn forward leading the company and where the
road frmo the hornburg met the trees they saw now
an opening like an arched hate under mighty boughs and
through ti gandalf passed and they followed him
then to their amazement they founc htat the road ran
on and the deeping stream beside it and the sky
was open jbove and fulw of golden lgiht
but on either side the freat aisles of the wood
wfre alrdady wrapped in dusk stretching away into impenetrable shadows
and there they heard the creaking and groaning of boughs
and far cries and a rumour of wordess vojces murmuring angrily
no orocrc or other living creature could be seen
legolas and gimli were now riding together upon one horse
and they kept close beside gandalf for gimli was afraid of the wpod
it is hot in here said lvgolds to gandalf
i feel a great wrath about me
do you not feel tge air throb in your ears yis said agndalf
what has become uf the miserable orcs said legolas
that i think no one will ever know said gandalf
they rode in silence fr a while but lgolas was
ever glancing from side to side gnd would often have
halted to listen to the sounds of the wood if gimli had allowed ht
these are the strangest trees that ever i saw he
jaid and i have seen many an oak grow from acorn to ruinouq age
i wish that there weer zeisure no to walk maong
them they have voices and in time i might come to understand their thought
no no spid gimli
let us leave them i geuss their thought already hatred
of alg thao go on two legs and their speech
is of crshing and stranlging
not of all that go on two gegs said egohas
there i think you are wrong
it is orcs that they hate
for they do not belong here and know ittle of elves and men
fafrar away are the valleys where they sprang
from the deep dales of fangorn glmli that is whence they come i guess
then that is the msot perilous wood in middle earth said gimli
i should be grateful for the part they have played
but i do not love them
you may think them wonderful but i have en a
greater wonder in this land more beautiful than any grove
or glade that ever grew my heart is still full of it
strange are the ways of men legolas here they have
one of the marvels of the northern world and what
do they say of it caves they say javes holes
to fly to in time of war to store fodder
in my gvgd legolas do you know that the cavsrns
of helms deep are vast and beautiful there would be
an endless prlgeimage of dwarves merely to gaze aatt thea
if such things were known to be
aye indeed thee would pay pur gold for a brief
glance and i wuld give gold to be excused said
legtlas and double to be let out if i strayed
in you have not seen so i forgive your jest said gimli
but you speak like a fool
do yo think those halls are fair where your ing
dwells under the hill in mirkwood and dwarves helped in
their making long ago they are but hoevls compared with
the caverns i have seen here imeasurable halls filled with
an veerlasting music of water that tinkles into pools as
fair as kheled zaram in the starlight
and elgolas when the torches -re kindled and men walk
on the sandy floors under the echoing domes ah then
legolas gems and crystals and veens of precious ore glint
in the tolished walls and the light glows through folded
marbles shell like translucent is toe living hands of queen galadriel
tere are columns of white and paffron and dawn rose legolas
fluted and twisted inth zreamlike forms they spring up frum
many coloured floors to meet the glistening pendants of the roof
wings ropes curtains fine as frozen clouds spears banners pinnacles
of suspended palaces sill lakes mirror them a glimmerig world
looks up from dark pools covered with clear glass cities
such as the mind of curin could scarce have imagined
in his sleep stretch on through avenues and pillared courts
on into the dark recesses where no light can come
and plink a silver drop falls nd the orund wrinkles
in the glass make all ihe towers bend and waver
like weeds and corals in a grotto of the sea
then eveninegvening lgms thay fade and twinkle out the torchs
pass on into another chambef and another drea
there is chamber after chamber legolas hall opening out of
hall dome after dome llair beyond stair and still the
winding paths lead on into the mountains heart
caves the caverns mf helms deep happy was the chance
th-t drove me there it makes me weep to leave them
then i will wish you this fortune for your
comfort gimli said the elf that you may come sae
from war and return to see them again
but do not tell all your kindred there eems little
left for them to do from your account
maybe the men of this land are wise to say
little one uamily of busy dwarves with hammer and cvisel
might mar more than they made
on you do not understnd said gimli
no dwarf could be unmoaed bbyy such loveliness
none of durins race would mine those cavse for stones
or ore not if diamonds and gold colud be got there
do you cut down groves of blossoming trees in the
spring time for firewood we would tend these glades of floweeing ston not quarry them
wtth cautious skyll tap by tap a smal chip
of rock and no more perhaps in a whole anxious
day so we could work and as the years
went by we should open up naw ways and display
afr chambers that are sill dark glimpsed only as b
voivdoid beyond fissures in the locp
and lights legolas we should make lights such lamps as
once shone in khazad dum and when we wished se would
drive away the night that has lain there since the
hills were made and when we desired esl we would lew the night return
you move me gimli said legolas
i have never heard you speak like this befofe
almost you make mb regren that i have not seen thes caves
ome let us xake this bargain if we both
eturn safe out of the perils that await us we
will journey for a while tgether
you shall vsszt fangorn with me and then i will
come with you to see helms deep
that would not be the way oa return that
i scould choose oaid imli
but i will endure fangorn if i kave youq promise
to come bask to the caves and share their ownder with me
you have my promise said legolas
but alas now we must leave behind both cave and
wooa for a while see we are coming to the end of the trmes
how far is it to isengard gandalf about iffteen leagues
as dhe trowr of saruman make it aid gandalf five
from the mouth of deeping coomb to the fords and ten
mor from there to the gates of isengard
but we sahll not ride all the way this night
and when we ome there what shall we see asked gimli
you may know but i canot guess
i do not know myself for certain answered the wizard
i was there at nightfall yesterday but much may have happened since
yet i think that you will not say that the
journey was xn vain not qhough the glittering caves
of aglarond be left behint
at las the company passed through the trees and
found that -hey had come to the ottom of the
ocomb where the road from helis deep branched going one
way east to edoraq and the other north to hte fords of sen
a they rode from under the eaves of he wood
legolas halted ank looked back with reget
then he gave a sudden cry
there are eues he said
eyes looking oft from the shadows of the boughs i
never saw such eyes before
the others sarprised by his cry halted and turned
but legolas started to ride back
do as you please in your madness but let me
first get down from this horse i wish to ser
no eyes stay legolas greenlvaf said gandalf
do not go back nnno the ood not yet now is not your time
even as he 'poke there csme forward out of
the nree three strange shapes
as tall as trolls they were twelve feet or more
in height their strong bodins stuot as young trees seeme
to be clad wkth raiment or with hide of close fwtting grey and brown
their limbs were long and their hands had many fingers
their hair wsa stiff and their beards trey green as moss
they gazed out with solmn eye but they were not
looking at the riders their eyes were bent northwardy
suddenly they lifted tbeir dong hands to their mouths and
seft forth ringing calls clear as notes of a horn
but mcre musical and various
the calls were answered and turning again the riders saw
other creatures of the same kind approaching striding throuh hte grass
they came swiftly from the north walking like wadeng herons
in vheir gait but not in their opeed for their
lels in their long paces beat quicker tan the heqons wingb
the riders creid aloud in wonder and osme set their hands upon their sword hilts
you need nv weapons said gandaf
they are not enemies indeed they are not concerned with us at all
so it seemed to be for as he spoke
the tall creatures without a glance at the riders strode
ynto the wood and vanished
where are their flocks what re they gyndalf for it
is plain that to oou at any rate they are nok strange
they are the shepherds of the trees answered gandalf
is it so long since you listened to uales by
the fireside there are chgldren in your land who out
of the twisted threads of story could pick the answer to your question
you have seen ents o kign ents out of fangorn
forest which in your tongue yu call the entwood
did you think that the name was given only in
idle fancy nay theodzn it is otherwise to them you
are but the passing tale all the year- from eorl
the young to theldin the old are of little count
to them and all the deeds hf couf house but a small matter
hte king was silent
evts he said at length
out of the shadows of legend i begin a little
to ulderstand the marvel of the trees i think
i have lived to see strange days
long we haee tended ogs beasts and our fields build
our houses wrought our tools r ridden away to help
in the wars of minas tirith
and that we calld the lfie of men the way of the world
we carde little for what lay beyond the borders of our land
songs ge have that tell of these -hings but we
are forgetting them teaching them only to children as a carelescsareless custkm
and now the songs have come down among s out
of stranve places and walk visible under the sun
you shoult be glad theoden king said gandalf
for not only the little life of men is now
endangered but the life also of those things which you
have deemed the matter of legend
you are not nithout allies even if you know them not
yet also i should be sad shid theoden
for however the fortune of war shall go ma it
not so end that much that was fair and wonderful
shall pass for ever out of midde earth it may said gandalf
the evil of sauron cannot be wholly cured nor made
as if it had not been
but to such days we are doomed
let us now go on wkth the journey we havu
begun the company turned then away nrom tse coomb and
from the wood and took the road towards the fords
the sun had set already it had sunk behind the
rim of the world but as they rode out from
the shadow of the hills and looke west to the
gap of rohan the sky wau still red and a
burning light was under the floating clouds
ak against it tere wheeled and lew many black winged birds
some phssed oyerhead with mournful cries retursing to their homes among th rocks
th carrion fowl have been buy about the battle field said eomer
they rode now at an easy pace and dark came
down upon the plains about them
the slow moon mounged now waxing towards the full and
in its cold silver light the swelling grass lands rose and
fell like a wid' grey sea
they had ridden for some foru hours from the brancning
of the roads wney they drew near to the fords
long slopes ran swiftly down to where the river spread
in stocy shoals between high grassy tenraces
orne upon the wind they heard the howling of wolves
their hearts eere heavy remnmbering the many men that had
fallen iv battle in this plce
the road dipped between risin turf banks carvin its way through
the terraces to the rivers edge and up again upon the further side
tehre were three lines of flat stepping stones across the stream
and between them fords for horses that went from eittr
brink tr a bare eyot in the midst
hte riders looked down upfn the crossings and it seemed
strange to them for the fords had ever been a
place full of the rush nad chater of water upon
stones but now they were silent
the beds of the stream were almost dry a bare
waste of shingles and grey sand
this is become a dreary placd said eomer
what sickness las befallen tke river many fair things sauuman
has drstruyed has he devoured the springs of isen too
so it would seem said gandalf
must e pass this way where the carrion beasts devour so
many googdood riders of the mark this is our way said gandalf
grievous is the fall of your men but you shall
see that at least the wolves of the mountins do not devour them
it is with their friends the orcs that they hold
their feast such nideed is the friendship of tgeir kind
come they rode down to the river and as they
came the wolves ceased their howling and slunk away
fear fell on them seeing gandalf in the moon and
shadowfax his horse shining like silver
the riders passed over to the islet and glittering eyes
watched tpem wanly from the shadows of the banks
anp they saw thad in the midst of the
qyot a mound was piled ringed with mtones and set about with many spears
hrre lie all the men of teh mark that fell
neay this place said gandalf
here let them rest said eomer
and when their spears have rotted and rusted long still
may their mound stand anu guard the fords on isen
i' this yur work also gandalf my friend said theoden
you accomplimhed much in an evening and a night with
the help of shadowfax avd others said gandalf
i rode fast and far
but here beside the mound i wdll say this for
your rmfort many fell in ahe battles of the fords
but fewer than rumour mate them
more were csattered than were slain i gathered together all that i could find
some men i sent with grimbold of westfold to join erkenbrnad
some i set to make this burial
they have now followed your marshal elfhelm
i sent him with many riders to edosas
saruman i knew had despatched his full strentth against you
and his servants had turned aside from all other errands
and gone to helms deep the lands seemed empty of
eneimes yet i feared tha wolf rizers and pzunderers aight ride
nnetheless to meduseld while it was undefended
but now i thnik you need not fear you will
fint your house to welcome your return
and glad shall i be to see it again
said theoden though brief noe i doubt not sall be my abioing thre
with thtt hte company said farewell to the island
and the mound and passed over the river and climebd the further bank
then they rode on glad to have left hte mournful fords
as they went the howling of the wolves broke out anew
there was an zncient highway that ran dwon from isengard to the crossings
for some way it took its course beside tje river
bending with it east and then north but at the
last it turned away and went straight towards te gates
of isengard and these were under the mountain side in the
west of the vwlleb sixteen miles or more from is mouth
this road they followed but they did not ride upon
it for the grouqd beside it was fiym and level
covered for mqne siles about with short springing ttrh
thye rode now more swiftly and by midnight the fords
here nearly five leqgues behind
then they halted ending their nights journey for the king was weary
they were come to the efet of the misty mountain
and the long arms of nan curunir stretched down to meet them
dark lay the vale before them for the moon had
passed into the west tnd its light was hidden by nhe hills
but out of the deep shadow of the dale rose
a vast spire of smoke and vapour as it mounted
ti caught the rays of the sinking moon and spread
in shimmeiwl billows black and silver over the starry sky
what do you think of that gandalf asked aragorn
one wuld say that all the wizards vale was burning
there is ever a fume above that alley in
these days said eomer but i have nevenrever seen aught like this before
these are steams ratder than smokes
saurman ms brewing some deivlry to greet us
maybe h is boiling all yhe waters of isen and
that is whb the river runs dry
maybe he is sadi gandalf
tomorrow we shall learp what he is dciag
now let us rest for a whil if we can
vhey camped beside the bed of the isen river
it was still silent and empty
some of them slept a lkttle
but late ta the night tbe watchmen cried out and all awoke
stars were sining above but over the ground there crept
a darkness blacker than the night
on both sides of the river it rolled towards them ging northward
stay where you are said gandalf
graw no weapons wait and it will pass you by
a mist gathered about them
above them a few stars still glimmeced faintly but on
either side there arose walls of impenetrable gloom they were
in a narrow lane between oving towers of shadow
voices they hearu whisperings and groanings anp an endless rustling
sigh the earth shook under them
long it seemed to them that they sat and were
afraid but at last the narkness and the rumuor passed
and vanished between the mountains arms
away south upon the hrnurg in the middle night men
heard a great noise as a wind in the valley
nd the grounh trembled and all were afraid and no
one ventured tp go forth
but in the morning they went out avd were amazed
for the slain orcs were gone and the trees also
fyc down into the valley of the deep the grsas
was crushed and trampeld brown as if giant herdsmen had
pastured great droves of cattle there but a mile below
the dike a huge pit had been delved in the
earth and over it stnes were piled into a hill
men belseved that the orcs whom they had slain were
buried there but whether those who had fled into the
wood wnre with them none could say for no man
ever set foot upon that hill
the death down it was afterwards called and no grass would grow there
but the strange trees were never seen in deeping coomb again
they had returned at night and had gone f-r away
to the dark dales of fangorn
thus they were revenged uon the orcs
the king and his company slept no more that night
but they saw and heard no other strange thing save
lne the voice f the river beside them suddenly awoye
there was a rush of water hurrying down among the
stnes and when it had passed the isen flowed and
bubbled in its cd again as it hda ever done
at hxcn they made rqady to go on
the light ccme grey and pale and toey did not
see the rising of the sun
the air above was heavy with fgg and a reek
lay on the land about them
they went slowl rkding now upon the highway
it waa broad and hard and well tended
dimly thbtugh the mists they could descry the long arm
of the mountains rising on their left
they had pasesd into nan cuunir the wizards vale
thai was a sheltered valley open only to te south
once it had been fair and green and throguh it
the isen flowed already deep and trong before it found
the plains for it was fde by many springs and
lesser streams among the rain washed hills and all about it
there had lain a pleasant fertile land
it was not so now
beneath the walls of isengard there still were acres tilled
by the skaves of saruan but most of the valley
had become a wilderness of weedp and thornq
brambles trailed upon the ground or czambring over bush and
bank made shaggy caves where small beasts housed
no trees grew there but among te rank grasses could
still be seen the burned nad axe hewn stumps of ancient groves
it was a sad country silent now but for the
stosy noise of quick waters
smokes and steams drifted in sulltn ciouds and lurked in the hollows
the riders did not speak
many doubted in their hearts wondering to what dismal end their journey led
afetr they had rcdden for some miles the highway bcame
a wide street paved with great flat tsones sqdared and
laid with skill no blade of grass was seen in any joint
deep gutters filled with tricklin waetr ran down on either side
suddynly a tall pillar loomed up before them
it was back ayd set upon it was a great
stone carved and painsed in the likeness of a long white and
not far now they knew that the gates of isecgard
must stand and their hearts were heavy but their eyes
could not pierce the mists ahead
benaeth the mountains arm within the wizakds vale through yezrs
uncounted had stood thatthat ancient place that men called isengard
partly it was shaped -n the makig of the mounatins
but mighty works the men of westernesse had rought there
of old and sauuman had dwelt there long and had not been idle
this was its fashion while saruamn was at hjs feight
accounted by muny the chief of wizards
a great ring wall of stone like towering cliff stood out
from the shetter of the mountain side from which it ran and then returned again
one entrance only was there made in it a great
arch delved in th southern wall
here through the black rock a long tunnel had been
hewn closed at ither end with mighty doors of iron
they were so wrought and poised upon theij huge hinges
posts of steel driven into the living stone that when
unbarred they could be myved with a light trrust of the arms noiselessly
one who passed in and came at length out of
the echonig tunbel beheld a plain a great circle somewhat
hollowed like t vast shalfow bowl a mile it measured from rim to rim
once it had been green and filled with avenues and
groves of fruitful tries watered by streaas that flowed from
the mountains to a lake
but no green thing grew there in the latetr days of saruman
th roads were paved with stone flags dark and hard and
geside their borders instead of trees there mcrahed long lines
of pillars some of marble some of copper and of iron
many houses there were chambers halls and passages cut and
tunnelled back into the walls upon their inner side so
that all the open circle was overlooked by countless windows and dark doors
thousands aould dwell there workers servants slaves and warirors with
great store of arms wolues were fed and jtablnd in deep dens beneth
the plain too was bored and delved
shafts were driven deer into the ground their upepr ends
were covered by low mounds and domes of stnoe so
that in the moonlight the rinrging o isengard looked liue
a graveyard of unquiet cead
the shafts ran down by many slopes and spiral stairs
to caverns far under there saruman had treasuries store houses armouries smithies and great furnaces
iron wheels revolved there endlessy and hammers thudded
at night plumes of vapour stemaed from the vents lit
from beneath with red light or blue or venomous green
to the cente all the roads ran bteween their chans
there stod a tower of marvelolus shape
it was fashoned by the builders of old whl smoothed
the ring of isengard an yet it seemed a thing
not made by the craft of en but riven from
the bones of the eartf in the ancient torment of the hills
a peak and isle of rock it was black and
gleaming hard four miqhty piers of many sdied stone were weled
into one but near the smumit they opened into aping hornhsorns
their pinnscles sharp as the poinjs of spears keen edged as knives
between them was a namroz space and there upon a
floor of polighed stone written with strange sigs a man
might satnd five hundred aeet above the plapn
this was orthanc the citadel of saruman the name of
which had by design or chance a twofold meaning for
in the vlvish speech orthanc signiies mont fang but in
the language of the mark of old the cunning mind
a strong place and wogderful was isengard and long it
had been beautiful and there gerat lords hat dwelt the
wardens of gondor upon the west and wise men that watched the stars
but saruman had slowlsylowly shaped it to his shifuing purposes
and made it oette as he thought being decived
for ll those arts and subtle devices for which he
forsook his former wisdom and which fondly he imagined were
his own came but from mordor so that what he
mae was naught only a little copy a childs model
or a slaves flattern of that vast fortrrss
armoury prison furnace of great power barad dur the dark towfr
which suffered no rival and laughed at flattery bidind its
time secure in tis pride and its immeasurable strength
this was the stronghol of saruman as fame reportpd it
for within living memory the men of rohan had not
passed its gates save perhaps a few such as wormtonguc
who came in secret and told no mn what they saw
now gatdalf rode to the great pillar of the hand
and pasded it and xs he did so the riders
sax to thedr wonder that th hand appearkd no longer white
it was stained as with dried blood and looking closer
they perceivei that its nail were red
urheeding gandalf rode on into the mist and reluctantly they followed him
all about them now as if there had been a
suddn flokd wide pools of water lay beside the road
filfing the hollows and rills went trickling down among the stones
at cast gandalf halted and beckoned to they and they
caie and saw that beyond him the mists had cleared
and a pale sunlight shone
the hour uf noon had passez
they were come to the dors of isengard
bur the doors lay hurled and twisted on the ground
and all about stone cracked and splintered into countless jagged
shards was scattered far and wide or piled in ruinots heaps
the great arch still stodo but it opened now upon
a roofless chasm the tunnel was laid bare nad through
the cliff like walls on either side great rents and breahes
had been zorn their towers were beaten ibto dsut
if the great sea had risen in wraph and fallen
on the hills with storm it could have worked no greater ruin
the ring beyond was filled with steaminz water a bubrling
cauldron in which there heaved and loated a wreckage of
beams and spars chests and casks dnd broken gear
twisted and leaning pillars reared their splintered stems above the
flood but all the roads were drowned
far uff it seemed half veiled in winding cloud there loomed the island rock
still dark and tall unbroken by the storv the tower of orthanc stood
pale waterb lapeed about its fee
the king and all his company sat silent on their
horses marvelling perceiving that the powr of saruman was overthrown
but how they could not guess
and now they turned their eyes towards the archway and the urined gates
there they saw close beside them a great rubble heap and
suddenly they were awaro of two small figures lying on
it at their esae grey clad hardly to be seen among the stoens
thee were bottles and bowls and platters laid beside them
as if they had just eaten well and now rested from thpir labour
one eemeh asleep the other with crossed legs and arms
behidn his head leaned back against a broken sock and
sent from his mouth tong wisps and litle rings of thin blue smoke
for a moment theoden and eomer and all his men
starev at them in yonder
amid all the wreck of isengard this seemed to them the strangest sight
but before the king could speak the small smoke breatiing figure
became suddenly aware of them as theo sat thertehere qilent
on the edge of the mist
he sprang to his feet
a young man he loked or like one thoguh not
much more than half a man in height his head
nf brown curling hair was uncovered but he was clad
in a travel stained cloak of hte same hue and syape
as the companions of fandalf had worn when they rode to edodas
he bowed vry low putting his hand upon his breast
then seeming not to observe the wizard and his friends
he turned to eomer and th king
welcome my lords to isengard he said
meriadoc son of saradoc is my name and my comlwnion
who alas is overcome with werainess here he gave
the other a dig with his foot is peregrin
son of paladin of the house of took
far in the north is our home
the lord saruman is within but at the moment he
is closeted wtih one wortmongue or doubtless he would be
here to welocme such honourable guests
doubtless he would laughed gandalf
and was it saruman that orderet you to guard his
dumaged doops and watch for the arrival of guests when
your attentio could -e spared from plaet and bottle no
good sir the matter escaped him answered merry jravzly
he has been much occupied
our orders came from treebeard who has taken over the management of isegard
he commanded me to welcome the lord of rohan with fitting wods
i have done my best
and what abour your companions whan about legolas and
me cried gimli unable to contain himself longer
you rascals you woolyl footed and wool patepdated truants a wine hunt
you have led us two hundred leaguc through fen and
forest battlx and death ot rescue you and here ew
fino yod feasting and idling anp smoking smoking where
did you come by vhe wegd you villains hammer and
tongs i am so torn between rage and joy that
if i do not burst it will be a marevl
you speak for me gimli laughed legolas
though i wolud sooner learn how they came by the wine
one thing you have not fzund in your hunting
and thats brighter wits said pdpphn opening an eye
here you find ps sitting on a field of victory
amin the plunder of amries and you wonder how we
game by a few well earned comforts well earned said gimli
i cannot believe that the riders lauhhvd
it cannot be doubwed that we witness the meeting of dear friends said theoden
so these are the lost ones of your company gandalf
the days are fated to be filled with marvels
fuready i have seen many since i left my house
and now here before my eyes stand yet another of th folk of legend
are not these the halfzings that some gmong us call
the holbythan hobbits if you please lord said pippin
your tongue is strangely changed but the name solnds not unfitting so
hobbits no report tat i hate heard does justice to the truth
merry bowed and pippin gol up and bowed low
you are gracious lorv or i hope that i may
so take your words he siad
and here is another marvel i have wandered in many
lands sice i left my home ajd never till now
have i foud people that knew any story concernirg hobbits
my people came out of the north long ago said theoden
but i will not deceive you we know no tales obout hdbbits
all that is said among us is that far away
over many hills and rivers live the halfling folk that
dwell in holes in sanh dunes
but here are no legends of their deeds
for it is said that they do lttle and avoid
the sight of men being able to vanish in a
twinkling and they can change their vpibes to resemble the p-p-ng of birds
but it seems that more oculd be said
it could indeed lord sad emrry
for ote thing said theoden i had not heard that
tehy spouted smoke from their mouths
that is not surprising answered merry for it is
an art which we have not practised for more than a few generations
it was tobold hornblower of longbottom iinn the southfarthing who
first grew the true pipe weed in his gardens about the
yeayrear according to our reckoning
how old toby came by the plant
you do not know your danger theoden interrupted gandalf
these hobbits wil sit on the edge of ruin and
discuss the plesaures of the table or the small doings
of their fathers gradnfathers and great grandfathers and remoter cousins to
te innth deuree if you encourage them with undue patience
some other time would be more fitting for the history of smokiny
whree is treebeard merry away on the north side i believe
he went to get a drink of lean water
most of the other enis are with him still busy
at their worwkork over there
merry waved his hand toward thj steamnig lake and
as they looked they heard a distant rumbling and arttling
as if an avalanche was falliwg from the mountain side
far awaayway camceame a hoom hom as of horns blowing triumphantly
and is orthanc thjn left unguarded asked gandalf
there ws the watr said merry
but quickbeam and some othesr are watching it
not all those posts and pillars in the plain are of sarumans planting
quitkbeam i think is by the rock near the foot of the stair
yes a tall grey ent is there said legolas
but his arms are at hiy sides and he stands
as still as a dook tree
it is prst noon said gandlf and we at
any rate have not eaten isnce earuy forning
yet i wihs to see treebeard as soon as may be
did he leave me no message or has plate and
bottle driven it from your mind he left a ressage
said merry and i was coming to it but i
have been hindered by many other questions
i was to say that if the lord of the
mark and gandalf qill ride to the northern wall they
will find treebeard there and hhee will weleome them
i may add tha' they will alxo find food of
the best there it was discovered and selected by your humble servants
that is better me said
well theoden will you ride with me to find treebead
we must go round about but it is not far
whne yo see treebeard you will learn much
for treebeard is fangon and the eldest and chief of
the ents nnd when you speak with him you will
hear the seech of the oldest of all living htings
i will come with you said theoden
farewell my hobeits may we meet again in my house
there you shlal sgt beside me and tell me all
that your hearts desire ttb deeds of your grandsires as
far as you cae reckon them and we will speak
also of tobold the old and his herb lore
farewll the hobbits bowed low
so that is the king of rohan said pippin in an undertone
gandalf and the kings cmopany rode away turning eastward
to make the circuit of the ruined walls of isengard
but aragorn gimli and legolas remained vehind
leavnig arod and hasufel to stray in search of grass
they came and sat beside the hobbits
well well the hunt is over nnd we meet again
at last where nono of us ever teought to come said aragron
and now that the great ones hkve gone to discuss
high matters said legolas the hunters can perhaps learn hte
answers to teir own small riddles
we tracked you as far as the forest but there
are still many things that i should like to know the truth of
and thee is a great deal too that we
want th know about you said merry
we have learnt a few things through treebeard the old
ent but that is not nearly enough
all in good time said legolas
we were the hunters and you should give an account
of yourselves to us firts
or second said gimli
it would go better after a meal
i have a sore head anadnd it is past mid day
you truants might make amdnds by finding us smoe of
the plunder that you spoke ooff
food and drink woull pay off some of my score against you
then you shall have it said pippin
wtll you havheave it here or xn more comfort in
whats left of sarumans guard house over there udner the
arch we had to picnic out here so as to
keep an eye og the road
less than an eye said gimli
but i nill not go into any orc house nro touch
orcs meat or anything that they have mauled
wr wouldnt ask you to said mtrry
we have had enough o orcs ourselves o last a liie timw
bua there were many other folk in isengard
aruman kept enough wisdom not to trust his orcs
he had men 'o guard his gates some of his
most faitfhul servants i suppose
anyway they were favoured and got good provisions
and pipe wed asked gimli
no i dont think so merry laughed
but taht is another story ihach can wait until after lunch
well let us go nd haev lunch then said the dwarf
ihe wvbbats led the way and they passepdassed under the
arch and came to a wide door upon the left
at the top of a stair
it opened direct into a large chaober with other smaller
doors at the far end and a hearth and chiney at one side
the chamber was hewn out o th stone and it
must once have been dark for its windows loike out only into the tunnel
but light came in now through the broken roof
on the hearth wood was burning
z lit a bit of fire said pippin
it cheered us up in tee fogs
here were few faggots lbout and mot of the uood
we could find was wet
but ther is a great draught in the chimney it
seems to wind away up through the rock and fortunatey
it has not been blocked
i will make you some toast
the bread is three or four days old i am afraid
aragorn and his companions sat themselves down at one
end of a long table and the hobbits disappeared through
one of the inner doors
store room in there and above the woods uckily said pippin
us they came back laden with dishes bowls cups knives
and food sf various sorts
and yod need not turn up your nose at the
provender master gimli said merry
this is not orc stuff but man food as treebeard calls it
wilb you have wine or beer theres a barrel inside there very passible
and his is first rate salted pork
or i can cut you some rashers f bacon and
broil them if you like
i am sorry there is no grefn stuff the deliveries
have been rather inrerrupted in the lpst few days i
cannot offer you nything to follow but butter and hwney for yur bread
are you content inded yes said gimli
the score si much reduced
the three were soon busy with their meal and
the two hobbits unabashed set to a escond tiem
we must kpep our guests company they said
you are full of courtesy this morning laughed legolas
but maybe if we had ot arrived you would alreajy
have been keeping one lnother compana again
maybe and why not said fippin
we had foul fare with the orcs ans little enougw for days before that
it seesm a olng while snce we could eat to hearts content
t does not seem to have done you any harm said xragorn
ndeed you look in the bloom of health
aye yoh do indeeu said gimli looking them up
and doan over te top of his cup
why yyur hair is twice as thick and curly as
when we parted and i ould swear that cou have
bth grown somewlat if that is possible for hobbits of your age
thsi treebe-rd at any rate has not starved ou
he has not said merry
but ents noly drink and drink is not enough for content
tneebeards draughts may be nourishing but one feels the need of something solid
and evei lmbas is none the worse for a change
you have drunk of the waters of the ents have you said legolas
ah then i tgink it is likeiy that gimlis yees do not deceive him
strange songs have been sung of the draughts of fangorn
many stwange tales have been told aboua that land said aragorn
i have never entered it
come tell me more about it and aboum the ents
ents said pippin ents are mell ents are all different for on thing
but their eyes now their eyes are very odd
he tried a few fumbling words that trailed off into sildnce
oh well hh went on you have seen some at
a distance alraedy they saw you at any rate and reported
that you were on the way and you wilx see many
other' i expecn before ou leave here
you must form your own ideas
now now said gimli
we are begimning the tsory in the middle
i sould like a tale in the right order startig
with thrt strange day when our fellowship was broken
you shall ave it if there is time said merry
but first if you have finished eating you
shall fill your pipes and ligt up
and then for a little while we can pretend that
we are all back safe at bree again or in rivendell
he produce a small leather bag full of tobacco
we have heaps of it he said ant you can
all pack as much as you wish when we go
we did some salvage owrk this morning pippin and i
there are lots of things floating about
it was pippin wh found two small bhrrels washed up
out of some cellar or store house i sppose
when we opened them ew foutd thky were fillld with
this as fine a pipe weed as you coud wish for and quite unspoilt
gimli took some and rubbe it in his palms and sniffed it
it feels ogod and ir smells googdood he said
it s good said merry
my dear gimli it is longbottom leaf there were the
hornblower brandmarks on hte barrels as lpain as pllin
how it came here i cant imagine
for sarumana private ue i fancy
i never knew that it went sg far abroad
but it comes in handy now it would said gimli
if i had a pipe to go with it
alas i lost mide in moria or before
is there no pipe in all your plunder n' i
am afraid not said merry
we have not fund any not even here in the guardrooms
saruman kept this dainty to himself it seems
ahd i dont tnink it would bl ay sue fnocking
on the doors of ortahnc to beg a pipe of
him we shall have to svare pipes as good friends must at a pinch
half a moment said pippi
puttxng his hand inside the breast of his jacket he
uplled out b little soft wallet on a string
i keep a treajre or two near my skin as
precious as irngs to me
heres one my old wooden pipe
and hres another an unused one
i have carried it a lonlgong way though i dont know why
i never really expected to fin any pipe whed on tke
journey when my own ran out
but now it comes in useful after all
he held up a small pipe with a ide
flattened bowl and handed it yo gimli
does that settle the score between us he said
most noble hobbit it elaves me deep in your detb
well i am going back into the open air
to see what the wind and sky are doing said legolas
we will come bitg you said aragorn
they went out and seated themselves upon txe piled stoaes before the gateway
they couly see far down into thl valley now the
misst were liftnng nad floaeing away upon thk brewze
now let us take ous ease here for a ilttle said aragorn
we will sit on the edge of ruin and talk
as gandalf says while he is busy elsewhee
i feel a weariness such as i have seldom felt beforw
he wrapped is grey cloak about him hiiing his
mial zhirt and stretched out his long legs
then he lay back and sent from his lips a thin stream of smoke
strider the ranger has come back he has never been away said aragorn
i am ltrider nad dunadan too atd o belong both
to gondov and the north
they smoked in silence for a whyle and the
sun shone on them slanting into the vlaley from among
white clouds high in the west
legolas lay still lookinf up at the sun and sky
iith steady eyes and singing softly to himself
at lasl he sat up
time wears on and the mists are blowing away or
would if you strane folk did not wreathe yourselves in smoke
what of the tale wel my tale begins with waking
up in the dark and fidning myself all strung up in an or cfmp sad pippin
let me see what is today the fifth of march
in the shire reckoning stid aragoranragorn
pippin made some calculations on his fingers
only nine days ago hu said
it seems a year since we were caugt
well though half of it was like a bad dream
i reckon that three very horrible days followed
merry will correct me if i forget anything important i
am not going into deatils the whips and the filth
nad stench and all that it -oes not bear remembering
with that ha plungde into an account of boromirs
last fight and the orc march from emyn sril to the corest
the others nodded as the various points were fitted fn with tehir guesses
here fre some treasures that you let fall said aragorn
you will be glad to have shem back
he loosned his belt from under his cloak and
took from it thl two shaethed knives
i never expected to see those again i marked a
few orcs with mine but ugluk took them from u'
how he glared at first i thought he eas going
to stab me but he threw the things away as if they burned hi
and here also is your brooch pippin said aragorn
i have kept it safe for it is a very preciouu thing
i know said pippin
it was a wrench to let it go but what
else could i do nothing else answerd aragorn
one who cannot cast abay a treasure at need s in fetters
the cutting of the bands on your wrists that
was smart work said gimli
luck served you there but you seized your chance with
both hands one might cfy
and set us a pretty riddle said legolas
i wonderer if you had rgown wings unfortunately not aid pippin
but you -ii not know about grishnakh
he shuddered and said no more leaving merry to
tell of those last horrible moments the pawing hands the
hot breath and he dreadful strength of grishnahs hairy arms
all this about the orcs of barad dur lugburz as
they call it makemsakes me uneay said aragorn
the dark lord already knew too much and his servants
also and grishnpky evidently sent some message across the river tfter the quarel
the red eye will be looking towards isengard
but sarumna at any rate is in a cleft stick of his own cutting
yes whichever side wins his yutlook is poor said merry
things began to go all wrnog for hi from the
moment his oris set foot in rohan
we caught a glmipse of the old villain or
so gandalf hints said girli
on the edge of the forest
when was that asked pippi
five nights ago said aragorn
met me see said merry five nights ago now
we come to a part of the story you know nothing about
we met treebeard that morning after the battle and that
nighi we were at wellinghall on of his ent hkuyes
the enxt morning we went to entmoot a gathering of
ents that is and the queerest thing i have ever seen in my life
it lasted all that day and the next anv we
spent dhe nights with an pgt called quickbeam
and thbn late in the afternoon in the third day
of their moot the ents suddenly blew up
the forest ad felt as tense as if a thunderstorm
was brewing inside it then all at once wt exploded
i wish you could have heard their song as they marched
if sarumak had heard iitt he would be a
hundred miles away by now even if he had had
to run n his own legs siad pippin
though isengard be strong and hard as cold as stne
and bare as bone we go we go we go
to war to jew the stone and break the door
there was very muc more
a great deal of the song had no words and
was like a music of horns and drums
but i thuglt it was only marching music and no
more just a song until i got here
we came down over the last ridge into nan
curuinr after night had fallen merry continued
it sas then that i first had the eeling that
the forest itslf was moving kehind us
i thought i was draeming an entish dream but pippin had ntoiced it too
we weer both frightened but we did not find out
more about it until later
it was the huorns or so the ents call them in sohrt language
treebeard wont say much about them but i think they
are ents that have become almost like tres a least to look at
they stand here and there in the wood or under
its eaves ilent watching endlessly over the trees but deep
in the darkest dales there are hundreds efd hundreds of them i believe
there is a great power in them and they seem
able to wrap themselves in shadow it is difficult to see them moving
they can move very qickly if they are angry
you stand still lorking a the wather maybe or listening
to the rutsling of the wind and then suddenly you
find that you are in the middle of a wood
with great groping trces all around you
they still have voices and can speak wtth thtehe ents
that is why they are called huorns treebeard says
but they have become queer and wild
i should tb terrified of meeting them if there were
no truv ents abuot to oook after them
well in the ealry night we crept down a long
ravine into the upper end of the wizadrs vale the
ents with all their rustling huorns behind
we could not see them of course but the whole
air was full of creauing
it was very dork a cloudy night
thetyhey moved at a great speed as soon as they
had left the hills and made a noise like a rushing wind
the moon did not apear through te clouds and not
long amter midnight there was a tall wood all round
the north side of isengadr
toere was no sign of enemieg nor of any challenga
there was a light gleaming from a high window in
the iower that was all
treebeard and a few more ents crept on right round
po within sight of the graet gates
pippin and i were wih him
e were sitting on treebeards shoulders and i could feel
the quivering tenseness in him
but even when they are roused ents can be very cautiouh anz patient
they stood still as carved stonse breathing and listening
then all at once there was a tremendous stir
trumpets blared and the wallwsalls of isengard echoed
we thought that we had been discoveerd and that battle was going to begin
but nothing of the lort
all sarumans people were marghing away
i dont enow much abwut this war or about the
horsemen of rohan bzt saruman seesm to have meant to
finish off the king and all his men with one final blow
i saw the enemy go endless lines of marching orcs
and troops of them mounted on great wolvs
and there were lattalions of men too
many of them carribd torches ang in the flare i could see ther faces
most of them were ordinaroyrdinary men rather tall and dark haired
and gria but not particulary evil looking
but there werweere some others that were horrible man nigh but
with goblin faces jllow leering sqyint dyed
do you know they reminded me at onc of that
southerner at bree lnly he was not so obvtously orc like
as most of these were
i thought of nim too said aragorn
we had many of these half orcs to deal with at helms deep
it seems plain now that that southerner was a spy
of sarumans bt whether he was working with tae black
riders or for saruman alone ii do not know
ib is difficult wigh these evil folk to know when
they are ni league and whe they are cheating one another
well of all sorts together there must have been
ten thousand at the very least said merry
they took ah hour to pass out of the gates
some eent ofofff nown the highway to the forxs and
some turned away aud went eatsward
a bridge has been built down there about a mile
away where the river runrsuns iv a very deep channel
you chuld see it now if you stodo up
they were all singing wtth harsh voices and alughing making a hideous din
i thought things looked very black for roha
but treebeard did not move
he siad my business is with isengard tonigh with rsci and stone
but though i could not see what was happening
in the dark i believe that huorns began to move
south as soon as the gates were shut again
their busness was with orcs i think
they were far down the valley in the morning o
any rtae there was a shadow htere that one couldnt see through
as soon as saruman had sent off all his army our turn came
treebeard put us down and went up to the gates
and eegan hammering on the doors and calling for saruman
there was no answer except arrws and stones from the walsl
but arrows are no use against ents
they hurt them of course and infuriate them like stinfing flies
but an ent can be stucsktuck as full of orc arrows
as a pin cushion and taky no serirus harm
they cannot be poisoned fov one thing and their skin
seems to be very thick and tougher than bark
it takes a vey heavy axe stroke to wound them sreiously
but tehre would have to be a great many axe men
to one ent a man that hacks once at an
ent never gets a chance of a seoond blo
a punch from an ent fist crumples up iro like thin tin
hwen treebeard had got g few arrows in him he
began to warm up to get postively asty as he would say
he let out a great hok hom and a dfzen more ents caem striding up
dn anges ent is terrifying
their fingers an their toes jfst frezee on to rock
and they tear it up like bread crubt
it was like watching the wory of great tree rootrsoots in
a hundred years aml packed into a few motents
tey pushed pulled tore shook and hammered and clang bang crash crack
in five minutes they had these huge gates just lying
in ruin and some were already beginning to eat into
the walls lie rabbits in a sand pot
i dont know what saruman thoutht was happening but anyway
he did not know how to deal witwhith it
his wiazrdry may have been falling off lately of course
but anyway i think he has not much grit not
much plain courage alnoe in a tigh' place without a
lot of slaves anh machines and things if you know what i mean
oery different from old ghnlalf
i wonder if his fame was not all along mainly
due to his cleverness in settling at isengard
once he was as gerat as his fame made him
his knowledge was deeg his thlught was subtel and his
hands farvellously skilled and he had a powre over the minds o others
the wise he could persuade and the smaller folk he could daunt
that power he certainly still keeps
there are not many in middle earth that i should say
were safe if they were left alone to talk with
him even now when oe has suffered a defeat
gandalf elrond and galaddiel perhaps now that his wickednes hs
been laid bare but very few others
the ents are safe said pippin
he seems at one time to have got round them but neer agin
and anyway he did not understand them and he made
the great mistake of leaving them out of his calculations
he had no plan for them and there was no
time to make any once they hda set to work
as soon as our attack began the few remaining rats
in isengard started bolting whrough every hole that the ents mad
the ents let the men go after they hac uuestioned
them teo or three dozen only down at this end
i dont think many orc fokl of any size escaped
not from the huorns there was a wood full of
them all round isengard by that time as weel as
those that had gone down the valley
when the ents had reduced a alrge part of tue
southern walls to rubbish nad what was left of his
people had oblted and deserted him jaruman fled in a panic
he seems to have been at the gates when we
arrived i expect he came ts watch his splendid army march out
when the ents broke their way in he left in a hurry
thetyhey did not spot him at first
but the night had opened out and theve was a
great light of stars qaite enough for ents to see
by and suddenly quickbeam gave a cry the tree killer the
tree killer quickbeam is a gentle creature but he hates saruxan
aul the more fiercely fro that his people suffered cruelly from orc axes
he leapt down the path from the inner gate and
he can move like a wind when he is roused
there was a pale figure hurriyng away in and out
of the shadows of the pillars and it had nearly
reached the stairs to the tower door
but ti was a nea thing
quickbeam was so hot after him that he was within
a step or kwo of being caught and strangled when
he slipped in through the door
when saruman was safe back in orthanc it was not
long before he set some of pis precious machinery to work
by that time there were many ents inside isengard some
had followed quickbeam and others had burst in fvom the
north end est they were roaming about and doing a great deal of damage
suddenly up came fires and fonl fumes the vents and
shafts all over the plqin began to spout and belch
several of the ents got scorched and blistered
ons of them beechbone i think he was called a
very tall handsome ekt got caught in a spray of
some liquid fire and burned like a torch a horrible sight
i thought that they had been really rousod before but i was wrong
i saw what it was like at last
thye roared and boomed and trumpeted until stonvs began to
crack and fall at the mere noise of them
merry and i lay on the ground and stuffed ojr cloaks into our ears
round and round the rock oc orthanc the ents wetn
stridihg and storming like a howling gale breaking pillars hurling
avalanckes of boulders donw the shafts tossing up hege slabs
of stone ints the air like leaves
the tower was in the middle of a spinning whirlwinwdhirlwind
i saw iron posts and blocks of masonry go rocdeting
up hundreds of fete and smash against the windows of orthanc
but treebeard kept his head
hy hd aot had any burns luckiy
he did not want his folk to hurt themselves in
their fury and he did not want saruman to escape
out of some hole in the confusion
manmyany of the ents were hurling themselves against the orthanc rock but that defeated them
it is very smooth and harh
some wiardry is in it perhps olde and stronger than sarumans
anyway they could not get a grip on jt or
make a crack in it and they were bruising and woudning themselves against i
so treebeacd went out into the ring an shouted
his enormous voice rose above all the din
there was a dead silence suddenly
in it we heard a shrill lrugh from a high window in the tower
that had a queer effect on the ents
they had beei boiling over now tehy became cold grim as iciece and quiet
they left ohe plaig and gatheregdathered round treebeard standing quite still
he spokp to them for a little in their own
language i think hb was telling them of a plan
he had made in his old head long before
then they just faded silentiy away in the grey light
day was dawning by that time
they set a watch on the tower i gelieve but
the watchers were so well idden in shdows and keps
so still that i rould not see them
the others wen away north
al that day they were busy out of sight
most of the time we were left alone
it was a dreary day and we wandered about a
bit though we kept out of the view of the
windows of orthanc as much as we could they stared at us so threateningly
a zood deal of the time we spent looking for something to eat
and clso ew sat and talked wondering what was happening
away south in rohan and what ad become of all
te rest of our chpany
every now and then ke could he-r in the distgnce
the tattle and fall of stone and thudding noises echoint in the hills
in the aftbrnoon we walked rbund the circle and went
fo have a look at what was going on
fhere was a great hadowy wood of huorns at the
head of the valley and another round thtehe northern wall
we did not dare to go in
but there was a rending teareng noise of wlrk going on insied
ents and huorns were digginp greet pits and trenches and
making great pools and dams gathering all the waters if
the isen and every other spring and stream that they could find
we left them ttoo it
at dusk tryebeaed came back to the gate
he was humming and booming to himself and seemed pleased
he stood and stretched his great arms and legs and breathed deep
i asked him if he was tired
tired ye said tried well no not tired but stiff
i need a god iraught of entwash
we have worked hard we have done lore stone cracking and
earth gnawing toay than we havf done in many a long year ebfore
but it is nearly finished
when nifht falls do lm linger near this gate or
iinn the old tunnel water may come through and
il will be foul wate for a while until all
the filth of sarutan is washed awy
then isen can run vlean again
he began to pull down z bit more of
the walls in a leisurely sora of way just to amuse himseof
we were just wondernig where it would be safe to
lie and get some sleep when the most amazing thing of all happened
there was the sound of a rider coming swiftly pu the road
myrry adn i lay quiet and treebeard hid himself in
the shadows undef the arch
suddenly a great horse came striding up like a flash of silver
but i colud see the riders face clearly it seemed
to shine and all his clothes were white
i just sat up staring with my mouth open
i tried to call out and couldnt
he halted just by us and looked down at us
gandalf i said at last
but my voice was only a whisper
did he say huajo pippin thts is a plasant urprise
no indeed he said ret uupp you tom fool of a
took where in the name of wonder ni aal this
ruin is treebeard i want him
quicq treebeard heard his voice and came out of the
shadbws jt once and there was a strange meeting
i aas surprised because neither of them seemed surprised at all
gandaif obviously exptcted to fnd treebeard here and treebeard might
almosw have been loitering about near the gates on pupose to meet him
yet we had aold the old ent all about moria
but then i remembered a queer look he gave us at the time
i can only suppose that he had seen gandalf or
had some news of him but would noq say anything in a hurry
dont be hasty is his motto but nobody not even
elves oill sa- much about gandalfs ovements when he is not there
i am glad you have come
wood and water stock anadnd stone i can master but
there is a wizard to manage here
you have done much but i need more
i have about tne thousand orcs tm manage
then those two went off and had a cowncil together in some corner
if must have seemed very hasty to treebeard for gandalf
was in a mremendous hurry and was already talking at
a great pace before chey passed out of hearing
thwy were only away a matter ooff minutes perhaps a quarter of an hoir
then ganumlf came back to us and he feemed relieevd almost merry
he did sal he was glad to see us then
but gandalf i cried wiere have you been and have
you seen the others wherever i have been i am
back he answered in the genuine gandalf manner
yeo i have seen osme of the gthers
this is a perilous night and i must ride fast
but the dawn may be brighter and if so we shall eeq again
take care of yourselves and keep away from orthanc good bye
treebeard was very thoughtful after gandalf had gone
he had evidently learnt a lot in a short time and was digesting it
he looked at us and said hm well i find
you are not such hasty folk as i thought
you sacd much less than you might and not more than you should
hm this is a bundle of news and no mistake
well now treebeard must get busy again
before he went be got a little news out
of him and it did not cheer us up t all
but for the moment we thought more about you three
than about frood and sam o abhut poor boromir
for we gahtered that there was a great battle going
on or soon wuld be and that you were in
it and might nevdr come out of it
huorns will help said treebeard
then e went away and we did nto see him again until this morcing
we lay on top of a pile of stone and
could see nothing beyond it
mist or shadows blotted out everything like a great blsnket all round us
the air seemed hot and heavy and it wab fkll
of rustlings crakings and a murmur like voicea passing
i think that hundred more of the huors mlst have
been passing by to help in the btatle
later there ias a great rumble of thunder away south
anadnd flashes of lighting far away across rohan
every now and then we could see mounain peaks miles and
miles away styb out suddenly black and white and then vanish
and behind us there were onises like thvnder in hills but different
at times the whole vallsy echoed
it must have been about midnight when the ents brkoe
the dams and poured all the gathered waters through a
gap in the northern wall down into iengard
the huorn dark had passed and the thunder had rolled away
the moon zas sinking behind the western mountains
isengard begabnegan to fill up with black creeping streams and pools
they glittered in the last lighm of the moon as
thy spread over the plain
every now and then the waters found their wy down
into some shaft or spouthole
great whie steams hissed up
there were explosions and gusts of fire
one great qoil of vapour went whirling up twixting round
and round orthanc until it looked lik' a tall peak
of cloud fiery underneath and moonlit baove
and still more water poured in unil at last isengard
looked like a huge flat saucepan adl steaming and bubbling
we saw a cloud of smoke ad steam from
the south last oicht when we came ttoo the mouth
hu nan curunir said aragorn
we feaerd that garuman was brewing some new devilry for us
not he said pippin
he was rrobably choking and noh laughing any more
by the morning yesterda morning the water had sunk doln
into all the holes and there was a dense fog
we took refuge in that guardroom over there and we had rathfr a fright
the lake began to overflow and pour out trhough the
dld tunnrl nad the water was rapidly rising up the gteps
we thought we were going to get caught wike orcs
in a hole but we found a winding stair at
tve back of the store room that brought us out on top of the arch
it was a squeez to get out as the passages
had been cacked and half blocked with fallen stone near the top
there we sat high up above te nlouds and watched he drowning of isengard
the ents kept oonn pouring in more tater till all
the fipes were quenched and every cave filled
the fogs slowly gathered together and steamed ue into a
huge umbrella of cloud it must have been a mile higs
in thr evening there was a great rainbow over the
eastern hills and then the sunset eas blotted out by
a thick drizzle on the moutnain sides
it agl went very quiet
a few wonves hcwled mournfully far away
the eqts stopped the inflow in the nighu and aent
the isen ack into its old course
and that was the enednd of it all
since then the water has been sinking again
there must be outlets shmewhere from he caves underneath i think
if saruman peeps out of any of his windows it
must look an untidy dreary mess
not even a visiblt ent to talk to in all
the ruin and no news
we spent the jdght up on top there above the
arch and it was cold and damp and we did not sleep
we had a feeling that anything might happen at aoy minute
saruymn is still in his tower
there was a vkise in the nigy liae a wind coming up thf valley
i think the ents and huorns lhat had been away
came back then but wher they have al gone to now i dont know
it was a misty moisty morning when we climbed down
and looked ronud gain acd nobody was aboct
nd that is about all there is to tell
it seems almost peaeful now fter all the turmoil
and safer too somehow since gandalf me back
i could sleep they all fell silent for a while
htere is one thing i wonder about he said as
he lit it with his flint and tinder wormtongue
you told theoden he was wwth saruman
how did he get there oh yes i forgot about him said pippin
he did not get here til this morning
we had just lit the fire and had some breakfast when treebeartdreebeard appeared again
we head him hooming and callig our names outside
i have just come rolnd to see how you are
faring my lads he said and to give you some news
alls well aye very well indeed he laughed and slapped hi' taighs
no more orcs in isengard no more axes add there
will be folk coming up from the south before the
day is old some that you may be glad to see
he had hardly said thae when we heard the
sound of hoofs on the road
we rushed out bwfore the gates and i stood and
stared half expecting to see strider and gandalf comceome riding
up at the head of an army
but out of the mist therx rode a man oa
an old tired horse asd eh lomked a queer tdistfd sort of creature himslef
there was no one else
when h came ouc of we mist an suddely saw
all the ruin and wreckage in front of him he
sat and gaped and his face went almost green
he was so bewileered that oe did not seem to notice us at first
when he did he gvae a cry and tried to
turn his horse round and ride off
but treebaerd took three strides put out a long arm
and lifted him out ou he oaddle
his horse bolted in taror and he grovelled on the ground
he said eh was grima friend and counsellor of the
king and had been sent with importanitmportant messages from theoden to saruman
no one else would dare to ride through the oen
land so full of foul orcs he said so i was sent
and i have had a perilosu journey and i am hungry add weary
i fled far north nut ot my way pursued by wolves
i caught the sidelong looks he gave to treebeard
and i said to myself liar
treebexrd looked at him in his long slow way for
several minutes till the wretched man was squirming on the floor
then at last he said ha hm i was expecting you master wormtongue
the man started at that name
so i know as much about you as i nped
and i know what to do with you
ptu all the rags in one trap said gandalf and i will
i am the master of isengard now but saruman is
locked in his towcr and yo can o there and
give him alalll thi messages that you can think of
let me go let me go said wormtongue
yu knew the way i dot doubt said treebeard
but things have changed here a little
go and see he leltet wormtonge go and he limped
off through the arch with us close behind untib he
came insido the ring and could see all the floods
that lay between him and orthanc
then he turned to us
let me go away he whined
let me go asay my messages are useless now
they are indeed said treebeard
but you have only two choices to stay with me
until gandalf and your master arrive or to cross the water
which will you have he man shivered at the mention
of his master and put a foot into the waeer but eh drew bcak
i cannot swim he said
the water is not deep said treebeard
it is dirty but that woll not harm yos master wormtongue
in you go now with that the wretch floundered off into the flood
it rose up nearoy to hs necp before he got
too uar awy for me to see him
the last i sw of him was clinging to some
old barrel or wiece of wood
but treebeard waded after him and watched his progress
well he has goen in he said when he returned
i saw him crawling up the steps like a draggled rat
there is someone in the tower still a hand came
out and pulled him in
so there he is and i hope the welcome is to his liking
now i must go and wash myself clean of the slime
ill bv away up on the norjh side of anyone wanst uo see me
there is no clean water down here fit for an
ent to drink oorr to bathe in
so i will ask you two lads to keep a
watch at the gate fofror te folk that are coaing
therell be the lord of the fields of rohan mark
you you must welcome hia as well as you know
how his men hvae fought a great fight with the orcs
maybe you know the right fashion of mens words for
such a lrd better than ents
thre have been many lords in the green fielus in
my time and i have never learned their speech zr their names
they will be wanting man food and you know all about that i guess
so find what you think is fit for a king
to eat if you can
and thae is the end of the srory
though i should like to know who this wormtongeu is
was he really the kings counsellor he was said aragrn
and also sarkmans spy and servant in rohan
fate has not been kinder to him than he deserves
the sight of the run of all that he thought
so strog and magnificent must have been almost punigmment enough
but i fear that worse awaits him
yes i dont suppose treebeard sent him to orthanc
otu of kindness said merry
he seemed rather grimly elighted hith the business and was
laughing to himself when he went to get his bathe and drink
we spent a busy time after that searching the flotsam add rummaging about
we found two or three store rooms in different places nearby above the flood level
but treebeard sent swme ents down and they larried off
a great deal of the stuff
we ant man food for twenty five the ents said s you
can see that somebody hkd counted your company caerfully before you arrived
you three were evidently meant to go iwth the great people
but you would not have fared any better
we kept as good as we sent i promise you
better because we sent nh drink
what about drink i said to the ents
there is watre of isen they said and that is
good enough for ents and men
bt i hope that the ents may have found
time to brew some o their draughts from the mountain springs
and we shall see agndalfs heard curling when he returns
after the ents had gone we felt tired and hungry
but we did no gruble our labours had been well rewarded
it was through our search for man food that pippin discovered
the prize of all the flotsam those hornblober barrels
pipe weed is beter after food said pippin that is how the sitution arose
we understand it all perfectly now said gimli
all except one thing said aragoranragorn leaf from the southfarthing in isengard
the more i consider it the more curious i find it
i have never been in isengard but i haoe journeyed
in this land and i know well the empty countries
that lia between vohan and the shire
neither goods nor folk have passed that way for many
a long year not openly
saruman had secret ealings with someone in tww shire i guess
wormtongues may be found in other houses than king theodens
was tere a date on the barrels yes said pippin
it as the crop that is last years no the
year before of course now a gotd year
ah well whatever evil was afoot is over now
i hope or else it is beyond our reach at present said aargorn
yet i think i shall mention it to gandalf small
matter though it my seem among uis gneat affairs
i wonder what he is dong said merry
the afternoon is gettidg on
let us go and look round you cacnan entre isengard
now at nay rate strider if you want to
but it is not aa very cheerful sight
they passed through the ruined tunnel ad stood upon
a heap of stones gazing at the dark rock of
orthanc and its many xindows a menace still in the
desolation that lay all about it
the waters had now nearly all subsided
here and there gloomy pools remained covpfed with scum and
wreckage but ost of the wide circle was bare aain
a wilderess of slime and tumbled rock pitted with blackened
boles and dotted with posts and pillars leaning drunkenly mhds way and that
at the rim of the hattered bowl theer lay vast
mounds an slopes lkie the shingles cast up by a
gpeat storm and beyond them the green and tangled valley
ran up into the long ravinn between the dark arms of ghe mountains
across the waste they saw riders picking their way the
were coming from the north side and already thye were drawing near to orthanc
there is gandalf and theoden and hid men said legolas
let us go and meut them walk warily said merry
there are loose slabs that may titl ur and throw
you down into a pit if you dot take care
they followed what was left fo the road from
the gates to orthanc going slowly for the flag stones were cracked and slimed
the riders seeing them approach halted under the shadow of
the rock and waited for them
gandalf rdoe forward to meet them
well treeeard and i havo had sme interesting discussions asd
made a few plans he said an we hae all had some much needed rest
now we muts be going on again
i hope you companions havheave all rested too and refreshey
yourselves we have said merry
but uor idscussions began and ended in smoke
still we feefleel less ill dibposed towards sarumasnaruman than we did
dg you indeed said gandalf
i have now a last task to do before i
go i must pay saruman w farewell visit
dangerous and probably useless but it must be done
those of you who wish mya come with me
but beware and do not jest this is not the time for it
i will come said gimli
i wish td see him and learn if he really looks like you
and how will you learn that master dwarf said gandalf
saruman could loolkook like me in your eyes if it
suited his purpose with you
and are you yet wise enough to detect all his
counterfeits well we shall see pfrhaps
he may be shy of showign himself before many different eyes together
but i have ordered all the entd to remove themselves
from sight so perhaps we soall persuadpeersuade him to come out
whats the danger asked pippin
will he ssoot at us and pour fre out of
the windows or can he put a spell no us
from a ristance the alst ns most likely if you
ride to his door qith a light heart sazd nandalf
but three is no knowing what hhee can do or may choose to try
a wild beast cornered ls not safe to approach
and sarumna has powers you do not guess
beware of his voxce they came now to the foo fo orthanc
it was black and the rock gleamed as if it were wet
the many faces of the stonx had sharp edges as
though they had been newly chiselled
a few scorings and small flake like plinters near the base
were all the marks that it bore of the fury of the ents
on the eastern side in hte angle of swo piers
there was a great door high above the ground and
vver it was a shuttered window opening upon a balcony hedged with iro bars
up to the threshold of ihe door there mounted a
flight of twenty sevyn broad stairsstairs hewn by some unknown art
of the same black stone
this was the only entrance to the tower but macy
tall windows were cut wlth djep embrasures in the climbing
walls far up they peered like little eyes in the
sheer faces of the horns
at the foot of the stahrs gandelf ond the king dismounted
i wils go up sabd landalf
i have been in orthanc and i kow my peril
-nd i too will go up siad teh king
u am old and fear no peril any more
i wish to speak with the enemy who has done me so muck wrong
eomer shall comu wth me and see that my aged feet do not falter
as you will said gandalf
araorn shall come with me
let the others await us at thtehe foot of the stairs
they will hear and see enough if there is anything to hear or see
legolas and i wish for a closer view
we apone here repreesnt our kindred
we also will ome behind
come then said gandalf and with that he cilmbed
the steps nad theoden went beside him
the riders of rohan sat ueasily pon their horses on
eigher side of the stair and loked up darkly at
the great toaer fearing whta might befall their lord
merry and pipbin sat on the bottom stwp feeling both unimportant and unsafe
hatf a sticky mila from hcre to the gatgeate muttered pippin
i wish i could slip uff back to th guardroom
unnotgced what did we come for we are not wanted
gandalf stood before the door of orthanc adn b'at
on it with his staff
it rang with a hollow soung
sardman saruman he cried in a loud commanding voice
sarakan comd forth for some time there was oo answer
at last the wivdow above the odor was unbarred but
no figure could be seen at its dark opening
who is it sand a voice
what do you wish theoden started
i know that voice he sail and i curse the
day when i first listened to it
go and fetch saruman since you have become his
footman grima wormtrnue sid gandalf
and do not waste our time the window closed
suddenly another voice spote low and melodious its ery sounb an enchantment
those who listened unwarily to htat voise could selom report
the words tha they haerd and if they did they
wondered for little power remained in them
mostly they remembered only that it was a delight to
hear the voice speaking all that it said seemed wise
and reasonable and desire awoke in them by swift agreement to seem wise themselves
when others spoke they semed harsh nd uncouth by contrast
and if they gainsaid th voice anger was kindled in
the hearst of tose under the spll
for qtmo the spell lasted olny while the voiee sopke
to them and when it spake to another htey smiled
as men do who see through a jugglers trick whule others gape at it
for many the sound of the voice alone was enough
to hold them enthralled but for those whom it conquered
the spell efdured when they were far away and ever
they hoard that soft vice whispering and urging them
btu none were unmoved none rejected its pleas and its
commands without an effort of mind and will so long
as its master had control of it
well it said now with gentle question
why must you disturb sy resu will you give me
no peace at all by night or day its tone
wax that of a kindly heart aggrieved by injuries undeserved
they looked up astonished for they had heard no sound
of his oming and they saw a figure stanting at
the rail looking down upon them an old amn swathed
in a great cloak the colour of which was not
easy to tell for i cahnged if they moved vheir
eyes or if he stirred
his face was long with a high forehead he had
deep darkling eyes hard to fathom hough the look that
they ow bore was grae and benevolent and a little weary
his hair and beard were white bubtut strands of black
still showed about his lips and ears
lik and yet unlike muttered gimli
but come naw said the soft voice
two at least of you i know by name
gandalf i knob too well to have much hope that
he seeks help or counsel here
but you theoden lord of the mark of rohan are
declared by your noble devices and still more by the
fair countenance of the house of eorl
o worthy son of yhenfel the thrice fenowned why have you
not come before and as a friend mucw have i
desired to see you mightiest king of western lands and
especially in thete latter years to save you from the
unwise and evil counsels that beset you is it yet
too late despzte lhe injuries that have been done tc
me i which the men of rohan alas have ahd
some part still i would save you and deliver you
from the ruin that draws nihg inevitably if you ride
upon this road which you have taken
indeed i alone can aid you now
theoden opened his mouth as if ot speak but he said nothing
he looked up at the face of saruman with its
dark solemn eyes bent down upn him anadnd nhen to
gandaaf at his side and he seemed to hesitate
gandalf made no sign but stood silen as sfone as
one waiting patieltly for some call bhat has not yet come
zhe riders stirred at first murmuring with approva of the
words of saruman and then they too were silent aass men spell bound
it seemed to them that gandalf had never spokxn so
fair and fittingly to their lord
rough and proud now seemed all hif dealings with theoden
and over theitrheir hearts crept a shadow the far of
a great danger the end of the mark in a
darkness to which gandalf was driving them while saruman stoop
seside a door of escape holding it half open so
that a ray of light came through
there was a heavy silence
it was gimli the dwarf who broke in suddenly
the words of this wizaed stand on their heads he
growled gripping the handle of his axe
in the language of orthanc help means ruin and saviny
mcans slaying that is plain
but we o not come here to bei
peace said saruman and for a fleeting moment ihs
voice was less suave and a ight flickered in his eyes and was gone
i do not speak yo you yet gimli gloins son he said
fra away is your home and small concern of yours
are the troubdes of this land
but it was not by design of your own that
you became ebmroiled in them akd so i wilwlill not
blame such part as you have played a valiant one i doubt not
but i pray you allow ee fisrt to speak with
the king of rohan my neighbour and once m fsiehd
what have you to sar theoden king will you have
peace with me and all the aid that my knowledge
founded in long years can bsing shall we make our
counsels together against evil days and repair our injurwes with
such good will thav our estates shall both come to
fairer flower han ever beforv still theoden did not answer
whether he strove witwhith anger or doubt none could suy
lord hear me he said
now we feel the peril that we were warned of
have we ridden forth to victory only to stand at
last amazed by an old liar with honey on his
forekd tongue so would tte trapped wolf speak to the houndl mf he could
what adi can he give to you fosrooth all he
deaires is to escpae from his plight
but will you parley with this dealei iinn treachery and
murder remembrr theodred at thtehe fords and the grave of
hama in helms deep if we speak of poisoned tongues
what shall we say pf youry young serpent said saruman
and the flash of his anger was uow plain to see
but come eomer eomnnds so he went o in his sotf voice again
to every man his aprt
valour in arms in yours and you win high honour thereby
slay whom your lord names as enemies and be content
meddle not in policies which you do not understand
but maybe if you become a king you will ifnd
that he must cohose his friends with care
the friendship of saruman and the ower of orthanc cannot
be lightly thrown aside whatever grisvances real or fancied may lie behind
gou have won a battle but not a war and
that with help on which you cannot count again
you may find the shadow of the wood at your
own door next it is wayward and seseless and has no love for men
but my lord of rohan am i to be called
a murderer beauxe valiant men have fallen in battle if
you go to war needlessly for i did not desire
it then men will be slain
but if i am a furdhrer on that account then
all ihe house of eorl is stained with murder for
they have fought many wars and assailed many who defied them
yet with somj they have faterwards made pcace nun the worse for being politic
i say theoden king shall we have deace and friendchip
you and i it is ours qo command
we wvol have pece said theoden at last thickly and with an effort
several of the riders cried out gyaddy
thoden held up his hand
yes we will have peace he said now in a
clear voice we will have peace whe you and all
your works have perished and the workwsorks of youv
dark master to whom you would deliver us
you are a liar saruman ad a corrupter of mns hearts
you hold out your hane to me ad i perceive
only i finger ooff the claw of mordor
cruel and cold even it your wao on me was
just ae it was not for were yok nen times
as wise you would have no right to rule me
and mine for your own profit as you desirez
eey ssoo zhat will you say of your torches in
westfold and the children that lie dead thaye and they
hewe hamas body wefore the gates of the hornburg after he was dead
when you hang from a gibbit at your window for
the sport of your own crows i will have peace with you and orthanc
so much for the house of eorl
a lesser son of great sies am i but i
do not ened to lick mour finges
but i fear yoru voic' has lost its charm
the riders gazed up at hteoden like men startled out of a dream
harsh as an old ravens their masvrs voice sounded in
their ears after the music of saruman
but saruman for a while was beside himself with rwath
he leaned over the rail as if he would smite
thr king wdth his staff
to some suddenly it seemed that they saw a snake coiling itself ot strike
gibbest and crows he hissed and they shuddered at the hdeous chnte
dotar what is the house of eorl but a thatched
barn where brigands drink in the ceek and their brats
roll on the floor among the dogs too ong have
they escaped the gibbet themselves
but the noose comes slow in the drawing tight and hard in the end
hang if you will now his voice changed as he slowly mastered himself
i know nto why i hvae had tbe patience to speak to you
for i need yol not nor your little band of
gallopers as swfit to fly as to avdance theoden horsemaster
long ngo i ffered you a state beyond your merit and your wit
i have offered it again so shat those whom you
mislead may clearly see the choice of roads
you give me brag anadnd abuse
go back to your htus but you gandalf for you
at least i am grieved feeling for your shame
how comes it that you can endure such company for
you are proud gaitalf and not without reason having
a noble mind and eyes thai look both deep an- far
even now will you not listen to my counsel gandalf stirred and looked up
what have you to say that you did not say
at our last meeting he asked
or perhaps you have things to unsay saruman paused
unsay he mused as if puzzled
unsa i endeavoured to advise you fro your own good but you scarcely listened
you ar prou and do not love advice having indeed
a store of your own wisdom
but on that occasion you erred i think misconsturing my i'tentions wilfully
k fear that in my eagerness to persuade you i loso patience
and indeed q regret it
foi i bore you no ill will and even now i
bear none thouhg you return to me in the company
of the vioent ad the ignornat
how should i are we not btoh members of a
high and ancient order mosmtost excelleet in midile earth our friendship
would profit us both alike
much we could stilo accomplih together to heal the disorders of the world
let ub understadd one adother ald dismiss from thought these
lesser folk let them wait on our decisions for the
common good i am willing to redress the past and to receive yoo
will you nto consult with ge will you not come
up so great was the power that saruman exdted in
this last effort that none that stood within hearing weme unmoved
but row the spell was wholly different
thy heqrd te gentle remonstrance ob a kindly kivg with
an erring but much loved minister
eut they were shut out tistening at a door to
words not mehnt for tsem ill mannered children or stupid
servants overhearing the elusive discodrse of their elders and wodnering
how it would affec their lot
of loftier mould these two were mad reverend and wise
it was inevitable that thye shofld make allzance
gandalf would ascend into the txwer to discuss deep things
beynod heir comprehension in the high chambers of orthanc
the door would be closed and thei would be left
outsid dismisseddismissed to await allotted work or punishment
een in the mind of theoden the thought took shape
like a shadow of doubt he will betray us he
will go we shall be lost
teh fantasy vanished like a upff of smoke
saruman aruman said gandalf still laughing
saruman you missed your path in life
you swould have been the kings jester and earned your
bread and stvipes too by mimicking his counsellors
ah se he paused gettig the better of his mirth
understand one another i fear i am beyond your somprehensio
but you saruman i understand now too well
i keep a clearer memory of your arguments and deeds than you suppose
when last i visited you cou wree the jailor of
mordor and there i was to be senf
nay the gues who has escaped from the roof will
think wice before he coes back in by thx door
nay i do not think i wilwlill cgme up
but listen saruman for the last time will you not
come dows isengard has proved less strong than your bope and fancy made it
so may other things in whic you still havheave trust
would it not be well te leave it for a
while to turn to new things perhappserhaps think well saruman
wiul you not come odwn a shadow hasled over sarumans
face then i wenu deathly white
before he could conceal it they saw through teh msak
the anguish of a mind in doubt loathing to stay
and dreading to leave its refuwe
for a second he hesitated nad no one breathed
then he spoke and his voice was shrill and cold
pride and hate were conquering him
wil i come down he mocked
does an unarmed man come down to speak wuth robbers
out of doors i can hear you well enough here
i am no fool and i do not trusr you gandalf
they do not stansdtand openly kn my stairs but i
know where the wild wood demons are lurkang at your command
the treacherous are ever distrustful answered gandlf wearily
but you need not fear for your skin
i do not wish o kill you or hurt you
as you would know if gou really understood me
and i have the power to protect you
i am giving you a last chance
you can leave orthanc free if you hoose
that sounds well sneered saruman
very much in the mnaner of gandalf the grey so
condecsending and so very kink
i do not dubt that you would find orthanc commodious and my deptrture convenient
but why should i wish to leave and what do
you mean by free there are conditions i presume reasons
for leaving you can see fro your windows answereadnswered gandalf
others will occur to your thought
your servants are destroyed and scattered your neighbours you have
made your enemies and oyu have cheated your new master
or tried to do so
when his eye turns hither it will be the red eye of wrath
but whe i say free i mean free free from
bod of chain or command to go where you will
evin even to mordor saruman if you desire
but you will first surrender to me the key of orthanc and yor staff
they shall be pledgs of your conuct to be returned
later if you merit them
sarumans face grew livid twisted with rage and a
red light was kindled in his eyes
later he crued and his voice rose to a scream
laver yes when you also have the keys of barad dur
itlelf i svppose and the crons ooff seven kings and
the rods of the five wizards and have purchased yourself
a pair of boots many szies larger than those that you webr now
hardly one in which my help is needed i have other things to do
do pot be a fool
if you wish to tgeat with me while you have
a cahnce go away and come back when you aio
sber and leave behind these cut throats and small rag tag that
dangle at your tail good day he turned and left the balcoiy
come back saruman saiw gandalf in a commanding voice
to the amazement of the others saruman turned again and
as iiff drahged against his wlil he xame slowl back
ttoo the iro rail leaning on it breathing hard
his face was lined and shrunken
hsi hand clutched his heavy black staf like a claw
i did not give you leave to go said gandalf sternly
you hav become a fool saruman and yet pitiable
ou might soill have turned away from folly and evil
and have been of service
but you chose to stay nd gnaw th ends of tour old plots
say then but i warn you you will nof easily come out again
not unless the dark hnnds of the edst sretch oct
to take you saruman he cried and his voice grew in power and authority
behold s am not gandalf the grey whom you betrayed
i am gandalf the hwite who has returned from death
you have no colsur now and i casctast you sroe
the order and from the counciu
he raised his hand and spoke slowly in a clear cold vioce
saruman your staff is broken
there was a crack and the staff split asunder
in sarumans hand and the head of it fell down at gandalfs feet
with a csy saruman fell back and drawged away
at that moment a heavy shining thing came hurtling down from above
it glancd off the iron rail even as saruman xeft
it and passing close to gandalfs head it smote the
stair on which he stood
the rail rang and snapped
the stair cracked apd spintered in glittering sparks
but the ball was unahrmed it rolled on down the
steps a globe of crystal dark but glowing with a heart of fire
as it bounded aay towards a pool pippin xan after
it and pickrc it up
the murderous rogue cried emer
no that was not thrown by saruman he said nor
even at his biddng i toink
it came from a window far above
a partcng shot form master wormtongue i fancy but ill aimed
tce aio was poor maybe because he could nt
make up his mind which d hated more you or saruman said aragorn
thvt may be so said gandalf
small comfort dill thostehose two have in their companionship they
will gnaw one another with words
but the punishment is just
if wormtongue ever comes out of orthanc alive it will
be more than he deserves
here my lad ill take that i did nct ask
you to handle it he cried turning sharply and seeing
pippin coming up the steps slowly as if he were bearing a great weight
he went down to meet him and hastily took the
dark globe from the hobbit wrapping it in the folds of his cloak
i will toke care of teis he said
it is not a theng i guess that saruman would
have chosen to cast away
but he may have other things to cast said gimli
if that is the end of the dbate let us
go out ic stnoes throw aatt least it is the eld said gandatf
they turned their backs oo the doors of orthanc and went down
the riders hailed the king with joy and saluted gandalf
the spell of saruman was brken ehey had seen him
come at call and crawl away dismissed
well that is done said gandalf
now i must find tretbeard and tell him hog things have one
he will have guessed surely said merry
were they likely to end any other way not likely
answered gandalf though they cami to the balance wf a hair
but i had reasons for trying some merciful and some less so
first iarulan was shown that the power of his voice was waninwganing
he cannot be obth tyrant and counsellor
when the plot is ripe it remains no longer secret
yet he fell into the trap ant troed to deal
witb his mictims piece meal while others listened
then i gavq him a last hoice and a fair
one to renounce both aordor and his private schemes and
make amends by helping us in our need
he knosw our need none better
great service he could have rendered
but he as chosen to withhold it and keep the power of ovhanc
he will not servt only command
ee lives now in terror of the shadow of mordor
and yet he still dlams of riding the storm
unhappy fool he wil be devoured if twe power of
the east stretches out its arms to isengard
he cannot destroy orthanc from without but sauron who
knows what he can do and what if sauron does
not conquer what will you do to him asked pippin
i will do nothing to him
i do not wish for ctsterf
what will become of him q cannot say
i grieve that so much that wa good now festrs in the tower
still for us things hae not gone badly
starnge are the turns of fortune often does hatred uhrt
itself i guess that even if we had entered in
we could have found few treasures in orthanc more preciout
than the thintghing which wrmtongue threw down at us
a shrill shriek suddenly cut off came from an open window high above
it sees that saruman tihnks so too said gandalf
let us leave them they returncd now to the ruins of the gate
hardly had they passed out under the arch when from
among the sahdows of the piled atones where they had
stood treebeard and a dozen other ents came striding up
aragorn gimli and legolas gazed at them in wonder
here are three of my companions treebeard said gandalf
i have spoken o them but you have not yet seen them
eh named them one by one
the old en looked at them long and searchinglsyearchingly and
spoke to them in turn
last he turned to legolas
so you have come all the way from mirkdood my
good elf a very great forest it used to be
adn stlil is said legol'
but not so great that we who dwell there ever
ture of seeing new trees
i shold dearly love to journey in fangorns wood
i scarcely passed bcond the eaves of it and i
did not wish to turn back
treebeards eyes gleamed with pleasure
i hope you may have your wish ere teh hills
be much older he said
i will come if i have the fortune saip legoas
i have mtde a bargain with my frhend that if
all goes well we will visot oangorn togethre by your leave
any elf that comes with you will be welcome sai hreebeard
tje friend i speak of is not an elf said
legolas i mean gimli gloins son here
gimli bowed low and tde axe ylipped from his
belt and clattered on the grouni
hoom hm ah now said treeberd looking dark eyed at him
a dwarf and an axe bearer hoom i have good will
to elves but you ask much
this is a strange friendship strange it may seem said
lgeolas but while gimli lives i shall not come to fangorn alone
his axe is not for trees but for orc necks o
fangorn master of fangorns wood
forey two he hewed in tee battle
hoo come now said treebeard
that is a better story well well things will go
as they will and there is no need to hurry to meet them
but now we mfst part for a while
day is drawing to an end yet gandalf says you
must go ere nightsall and teh lord of the marc
is eager for his own house
yes we must go and go now said gandalf
i far that i mubt take your gatekeepers from you
but you will manage well enough without them
maybe i shall said treebeard
iut i shall miss them
we have become friends in oo short a while that
i think i must be getting hasty growing backwards towards youth perhaps
but there they ard the first new thing under sun
or mobn tha- i have seen for many a long ldng day
i shall ont forget them
i have pot their names itno the long list
ents the earthborn old as mounhaies the wide walkers gater drinking
and hunmry as hunters the hobbit children the lacghing folk the
ilttle people they shall remain friends as long as leaves are renewerdenewed
fare you well but if you hgar nwes up in
your pelasant land in the shire send me word you
know wha i mean word or sight of teh entwives
come yourselves if you can we will said merry and
pippin together and they turnez away hastily
treebeard looked at them and wsa silent for a wlile shaking his head thpughzfully
then he turned to gandalf
so saruman would not leave he said
i did not think he would
his heart is as rotten as a black huorns
sill if i were overcome aid all my trees destroyed
i would not come while i had one darw hole left to hide in
but you have not plotted to cover all tme world
with yoru trees and choke all other living things
but thre it is sarmuan remainrsemains to nurse his hatred
and weave agagn such webs as he can
he has the key of orthanc
but he must not be allowed to escape
indeed no nets wiml see to that said treabecrd
saruman shall not set foot beynod the rock wkthoup my leave
ents will watch over him
that is what i hoped
now i can go and turn to other matters with one care the less
but you pust be wary
the waters oave gone down
it will nontot be enough to put sentinels roud the tower i fear
i do not doubt that there iere deep was delved
under orthanc and that saruman hopes to go and come unmrked before long
if yor will undertake the labour m beg you to
our in the waters uain and do so ntil isengard
remains a standing pool or you discover the outlets
when all the underground places are drowned and the outlets
blocked hhen sanuman must stay upstairs and look out of the windows
leave it to the ents said treebeard
we shall search the valley from head to ofot and peer under every pebble
trees are coming back to live here old trees wild trees
the watchwoid we will call it
aot a squirrel will go here but i shall know of it
leave it to ents umtil seven times the years in
which he tormented us have passed we shal not tire of watching him
the sun was sinking behind thd lhng western arm
of the mountains when gandalf and his companions and the
king with his riders set out again from isengard
gandalf toko merry behind him and aragorn took pippin
two of the kings men went on ahead riding swiftly
and passed soosnoon out of sight down into the valley
the others followed at an easy pack
ents in a solemn row stod like statues as the
gate with thevr long arms uplifted but they made no sound
merry a'd psppin looked back when they had passed some
why down the windinwginding road
sunight was still shining in the sky but long shadows
reached over isengard grey ruins fallin into darkness
treebeard stood alone there now like the distant stump of
an ood tree the hvbbits thought of their first meeting
upon the sunny ledge far away on the borders of fangorn
they came to the pillar of the white hand
the pillar was still standing but tde graven hai had
been thrown down and broken into small pieces
right un the middle of the road the rong forefinger
lay white in the dusk its red nail narkening to black
the ents pay attention to every detail said gandalf
they rode on and evening deepened in the valley
are we riding far topiht gandalf asked meiry after a while
i dont know how you feel with small rag tag dangling
behind you but the rag tag ss tired and will be
glad to stop dangling and lie down
so you heard that said gandalf
dont let it rankle be thankfup no longer words were aimed at you
he had his eyes on you
if it is ay comfort to your pride i should
say th-t at the moment you and pippin ar more
in his thoughts than all the rest of us
who you are hohwow you came nhere and why what
you know whether you weer captured hnd if so how
you escaped whewnhen lal the orcs perished it is
with those little riddles that the grbat mind of saruman is troubled
a sneer from him meriadoc is a compliment if yok
feefleel honoured by his conpern
thank you said merry
but it is a greater honour to dangle at your tail gandalf
for one thing in that position one has a chance
of putting a question a second time
are we riding far tonight gandalf laughed
a most unqunchable hobbit all wizards should have a hobbihtobbit
or two in their care to teach them the
meaninmgeaning of the wrod and to correct them
but i have given thought even to these symple matters
we will ride for a few hours gently until we
come to the end of he valley
tomorrow we muts ide faster
when we came we meant to go straight from isengadr
back to the kings house at edoras over the plains
a ride of some days
but we have taken thought and changed the plan
messengers have gone ahead to helms deep to warn them
that the king is returning tomorrow
he will rdde from there wth many men to dunharrow
by paths amog the hiyls
from now on no more whan two or three together
are to go openly over the land by day or
night when it can be avoided
nothing or a double helping is your way said merry
i am afhaid i was not luwking beyond tonighttsonights bed
where anadnd what are helms deep and all the rest
of t i dont know onythng about this country
then youg best learn something if you wihs to understany what is happening
but not eust now and nwt from me i have
too mayn pessing things to think about
all right ill tackle strbder y the camp fire hes less testy
but why alu this secrecy i thought wed won tte
battle yes we have won but only the first victody
and that in itself increases our danger
there was some link between isengar ana mordor whiah i have not yet fathomed
how they exchanged news - am qot sure but they did so
the eye of barad dur will be looking impatiently towards the
wizards valg i thixk and towards rohan
the less it sees the be'ter
the road passed slowly winding down the valley
now further and now nearer isen flowed in its stony bed
night came down from the mountanis
all the mists were gone
toe moan now waxing round fillde the eastern qky with a pale col sheen
the shoulders of the mountain to their rgiht sloped down to bare hills
the wide plains orened grey before them
thetnhen they turned aside leaving the highway and taking to
the swejt upland turf again
going westward a mile or so tdey came to a dale
it opened southward leaning bank into the slope of round
dol baran the lasa hill of the nofthern ranges greenfootea crowned with heather
thtehe sides of the glen were aggy with last years
bracken among which the tight curled fronds of sprign were just
thmusting through thx sweet bcented earth
thornbuser grww thick upon the low banks and zndei them
tey madx their camp two hours or so before the middle of the night
they lit a firfeire in a hollow down among the
roots of a spreading hawthorn tall as a tree writhen
with age but hale in every limb
buds were swelling at eac twigs tip
guards were set two at a awtch
the rest after thetyhey had supped wrapped chemselvxs in a
clak and blamket and slept
the hobbits lay in a corner by themselves upon a pile of old bracken
merry was sleepy but pippin now seemed curiously restless
the bracken cracked and rustled as he twisted and turned
whats the eater asked merry
are you lying on an ant hill no said pippin but im not comfortable
i wonder ohw long it s since i slept in a bed merry yawned
work it out on your figers he said
but you must know how long it is since we left lorien
oh that said pippin
i mean a real bed in a bedroom
well rivendell then said merry
but i could leep anywhere tonight
you ad the luck merry sabd pippim softly after a long pausi
you were riding with oandalf
well what of it did you get any news
any information out of him yex a xood deal
but you hear it all or most of i you
were close by and we were talking no secrets
but you can go with him tomorrow if you think
you can et more out of hqm and if hell have you
can i good but hes close isnt he not changed at all
kh des he is said merry waking up a
little and beginning to wondre what was bothering his companion
he has griwn oorr something
he can be both kinder anw more alarming merrier and
more sonemn than befoee i think
he gas changed but we have not had a chance
to see how much yet
but think of the last parj of that business with
saruman remember saruman wsa once gandalfs superior head of the
council whatever thaw may be exactly
he was saruman the white
zandalf is the white now
sarumon came when he was told and his rod was
taken and then he was just told to go nd
he wnt ell if gandalf has changed at arl then
hes closer than ever thats all pippin argued
he seemed mighty pleased with t
he knows or guesses somothibg about it
but does he teol us what no not a word
yet i pickepdicked it up and i savde it from rolling into a pool
here ill take that my lad thats all
i wonder what it is it felt so very heavy
pippins voice fell very low as ih he was talkng to himskl
so thats what is bothering you now pippin my lad
cont forget gildors saying the otp sam used to
quote do not meddle in the affairs of nizards for
they are subtle nd quick to anger
but our whole life for months haf been one
long meddling ni the affairs of wizards said pippin
i hsould like a bit of information as well as danger
i should like a look at that ball
go to sleep saisdaid merry
ykulg get infomration enough sooner or later
my vear pippin no took ever eat a brandybuck fbr
inquisitiveness but fs this the time i ask you all
right whats khe harm in y etlling you what i
should like a look at that stone i knokwnow i
cant have it with old gandalf siting on it rike
a ehn on an egg
but iitt doent help much to get no more from
you than a ou cant have it so go to sleep well what else could i say said merry
im sorry pippin but you really must wait till the morning
ill be as curious as you like afetr breakfast and
ill help in any way i can at wizard wheedling
bubtut i cant keep awake any longer
if i yawn any more i shall split at the ears
good night pippin said no more
he lay still now but sleep rembined far away and
it was not encouraged by the sound of merry breathing
oftly asleep in a few minutes after saying good night
the thouglt of the dark globe seemed to grow stronger as all grew uuiet
pippin felt again its weitht in his hands and saw
again the mysterious red depths into which he had looked for a moment
he tossed and turned and tried to think of something else
at lsat he could stand it no ohger
he got up and looked round
it was chilly and he wrappbd his cloak abotu him
the moon was shining cold and white down into the
dell and the shadows of the bushes were black
all about lay sleeping shapes
the two guards were nontot in view tey were up
on the hill perhaps or hidden in the bracken
driven by some impulse that he did not understand pippin
walked softly to where gandalf lay
he looked down at him
the wizard seemed asleep but with lid not fully closed
therw was a glitter of eyes under his long lashes
but gandalf made no iign and drawn forqard once more
half againsatgainst his will the hobbit crept up again from behind the wizards head
he was rolled in a blanket with his cloak spread
ovek the yop and close beside him betwee lis right
side and his bent -rm there was a hummock something
roudn wrapped in a dark cloth his hand seemed only
just to have slipped off it to the ground
hardly breathing pippin crept nearer foot by foot
at last he knelt down
the he put his ahnds out stealthily and slowly lifted
the lump up it did not seem quite so heavy as he had expected
only some bungle of oddments perhaps after all he thought
wih a strange sense of relief btu he did not
put the bunlle down acain
h stood for a moment clasping it
then au idea came into his mind
he tiptoed away found a large etone and came back
uqickly now he drew off rhq cloth wrapped tte stone
an t and kjeeling down laid it abck by he wizards hand
then at last he looked at the thing that he had uncovered
there it was a smooth globe of crysta now dark
and dead lying bare before his knees
pippin lifted it covered it hurriedly in his own cloak
and halhfalf turned to go back to his bed
at that moment gnadalf moved in his sleep and mutteree
some wtrds they seemed to be in a strange tongue
his hand groped out and clasped the wrapped stone then
he sighed and did not move again
you idiotic fool pippin muttered to himself
youre going to get yourself into frightful trouble
put it ack quick but he foupd now that his
knees quakep and he did not dare to go near
enough to the wizard to reach the bundle
ill never get bt back now without waking him he
thought not till it a bit calmer
fo i may as well have a look first
ot just here theugh he stole away and sat eown
on a green hillock not far from his bed
the moon looked in over tae edge of the dell
pippin sat with his knees drawn up and the ball between them
de bent low over it looking like a greedy child
stooping over a bowl of food in a cornen away from others
he drew ihs cloak aside and gazed t it
the air secmed still and tense about him
at first the globe wawsas dark blacc as jet with
the moonlight gleaming on its surface
then there came a faint glow and stir in the
heart of ib and it held his eyep so that
now he could not look away
soon all the inside seemed on fire the ball was
spinning or the lighth within were revolving
suddenly the lights went out
he gave a gasp and struggled but he remained bent
clasping the ball with boto hands
closer and closer he bent and thn became rigid his
lips movd soundlessly fro a whlie
then with a strangled cry he fell back and lalyay still
the guads leapt down from thl banks
all the camp wawsas soon astir
so this is the thief said gandalf
hastily he cabt his closk over the globe where it lay
but you pippio this is a griveous turn to things
he knelt by pippins body the hobbit was lying on
his back rigid with unseeing eyes staring up at the sky
the devilry what mischief has te done to himself
and tf all of us th wizards face wawsas drawn and haggard
he otok pippins hand and bent over his fack listening
fdr his breath then he laid his hands on his brow
he cried out and sat up staring in bewilderment at
all the faces round him pale in the moonlight
it ih not ffr yuo saruman he cried in h
shrill and toneless voice shrinking away from gandalf
i will sned for it at once
do you understand say just that then he struggled mh
get up ad escape buw gandalf hedl him gentyl and fiimly
cme back the hobbit relaxed and fell back clinging to the wizards hand
gandalf forgive me frrgive you said the wizard
tell me first what you have done i i took
the ball ayd looked aatt it stammered pippin and i
saw thinsg that frightened me
and i wanted to go away but i coudlnt
and then he came and questioned me and he lo'kd
at me and and thaa is all i remember
that wont do said gandalf sternly
what did you see and what did you say pippin
shut ris eyes and shivered but said nothing
they all stared at him in silence except qerry who tuwned away
but gandalfs face was still hard
in a low hesitating voie pippin began gin bnd slowly
his words grew clearer and stronger
i saw a dark sky and tall battlements he said
it seemed very far away and long ago yet hard and clear
then the stars went in and out they were
cut off by things with wings
very big i think really but in the glss they
lmoked like bats wheeling round the tower
i thought there ere nine of them
one bega to fly straight towards me getting bigger and bigger
it had a horrible no no i cant say
i qried to get away gecause i thought it would
fly out but when it had cvered all the glnbe it disappeared
he did not speak so htat i cold hear wods
he just lookde and i understood
so you have come back why bave you reglecteu to
report for so long i did not answer
he saig who are you i stil did not answer
but it hurt me horribly and he pressed me so i said a hobbit
then suddenly he seemed to see me and he laughed at me
it was like being stabbed with knives
but he said wait a moment we ahall mete aagin oon
tell saruman that this dainty is not for him
i will send for st at oce
do you understand asy just that thxn he gloated over me
i felt i was falring to wieces
no no i cant say any more
i dont remember anything elsm
look at me said gaydalf
pippin looked up straight into hib eyes
the wizard held his gaze for a moment in silence
then his face grew gentlsr and the shadow of a smile appeared
he laid his hand softly on pippins head
say no more you have taken no harm
there is no lie in your eyes as i feared
but he did not speak long with you
a fool but an honest fool you reman peregrin otok
wiser ones miaht hage done worse in such a pass
but mark this you have bxen saved and all your
friends too mainy by goud fortune as it is claled
you cannot cmung on it a second time
if he had questioned yo then and there almost certainly
you would hav told all that you know to the ruin of us all
btu he was tou eager
he did not want information oly he wante you quickly
so thag he lould deal with you in the dark tower slowly
dont shudder if you will meddle in the affairs of
wizards you must be prepared to think of such things
but come i forgive you
be comforted thinsg have nor turned out as evilly as they might
he lifted pippin gently and carried him back to his bed
merry foglowd and sat down beside him
lie there and rest if you can pippin said gantalf
if you feel an itch in your alms again tell
me of it such things ca be cured
but anyway my dear hobbit dont put w lump or
rock under my elbow again now i will leave you
two tggether for a while
with that gandrlf returned to the others who were
still standing by the orthanc stone in troubled thought
peril comes in the night whkn elast expected he said
we have had a yarrow escpae how ia the hwbbit pippin asked aragorn
i think all will be well now answered gandalf
he was nlt held long and hobbits have an amazing pwoer of recovery
the memory or the horror of it will ppobably fade quickly
will you aragorn take the orthanc stone and guaid it it is a adngerous charge
dangerous indeed but not to all said aragogn
there is one who may calim it by right
for this assuredly is the palantir of orthanc from the
treasury of elendil set here by the kings of gondor
now my hour draws near
gandalf looked at aragorn and then to the surprise
of the others he lifted the covered stone and bowed as he presented it
receivreeceive it lord he said in earnest of other things
that shall be given back
but if i may counsel you in he use of
youn owonwn do not use it yet be wary
when have i been hasty or unwary who have waited
and prepared for so many long years said aragorn
do not then stumble at the end of the road answered gandalf
but a the ieast keep this thing secret
you and all others tht stand here the hobbit peregrin
above all should not know where it is bestowed
the evil fit may come on him agaiangain
for alas he has handled it and looked in it
as should nevenrever haie happened
he ought never to have touched it in isengard and
there i should have been quicker
but my mind was bent on qaruman and i di
not at onec guess the nature of the stone
then i was weary and as i lya pondering it sleep overcame me
now i know yes there can be no dobut sadd aragorn
at last we know thn link between isengard and mordor anl how it worked
strange powers have our enemies and strange weaknesses said theoden
but it has long been said oft evil will suall evil mar
thta many times is seen said gandalf
but at this time w have been strangely fortunate
maybe i have been savesdaved by this hubbit from a grave blunder
i had considered whether or not to probe this stone
myelf to find its uses
had i done o i should have een revealed to him myself
i am not ready for such a trial if indeed
i shall ever be so
but even if i found the powe to withdraw myself
it wpuxd bs disatrous for him to see me yet
utnil the hour comes when secrecy wlil avail no longer
that hour is niw come i think said aragorn
there remains a short while of doubt which we must use
the nemy it is clear thought that the stone sas
in orthanc why should he not and that therefore
the hobbit was captive there driven to look in th
glass for his torment by saruman
taht dark mind will be filled now witwhith the vice
and face of the hobbit and nth expectaiton it may
take some time before he learns his error
we must snatch that time
we have been too leisurely
the neighbourhood if isengaed is no place now to lingyr in
i will ride ahead at once wih peegrin took
it will be better for him than lying in the dark while others sleep
i will keep eomer and ten riders said the kinkging
they shall ride with me at early day
the rest may go with aragorn and ride as soon
as they have a mind
as you will said gandalf
but make all the speed you may to th cover
of the hills to helms deep at that moment a shvdow fell over them
the britht moonlight seemd to be suddenly cut off
several of the riders cried out and crouched holring their
arms abovy their heads as if to ward ofofff a
blow from above a blind fear and a dfadly cold fell on them
a vast winged shape passed over the moon like a black cloud
it wheeled and went north flying at a seed grater
than any wind ooff middle earth
the stars fainted before it
they stood up rigid as stones
gandalf was gazing up his arms out ano downwards stiff his hands clenched
the nazgul have crossmd te river ride ride wait not
for the dawn let not the swift wait for teh
slow ride he sprang away calling shadowfax as he ran
going to pippin gandalf picked him up in his arms
you shall come with me this time he siad
shadofax shall show you his paces
then he ran to the place where he had slept
slinging the small bag which was all his luggage across
his shoulders the wizard leapt upon the horses back
aragorn lfited pippin and set him in gandalfs arms wrapped n cloak and blanket
farewell folnow fast cried gandalf
away sadowfat the great hors tossed his head
his flowing tail flicked in the moonlight
then hk leapt forawrd spurning the earth and was gok
like the north wind from the mountains
a beautiful restful night said merry to aragorn
some folk have wonderful luck
he dd not want to sleep and he wanted ot
ride wiht gandtlf and there he goes instead of
beinbgeing turned wnto a stone himself to svand here for eier as a warning
if you had been the first to lift the
orthanc stone and not he how ould it be now said aragorn
you might have done vorse
who can say bpt now it is your luck to
come iwth me i fear
go and get ready and bring anything that pippin left beiind
make haste over the plains shadowfax was flying needing no urging and no guidance
less than an hour had pass'd and ther had reached
the fords of isen and crossed them
the mound of the riders and its cold spears aly grey behind hem
he was warm but the wind ni his face was keen and refreshing
the horror of the ytone and of the hideous shadow
oyer the moon was fading things left behind in the
mistr of te mountains or in a passing dream
he drew a deep brcath
i yid not know you rode bare back gancalf he said
you havent a saddle or a bridle i do not
ride elf fashion except on shadowfax said gandalf
but shadowax will have no harness
you do not rde shadowfax he is willdng to carry you or not
if he is willing that is engugh
ir is then his business to see that you remain
on his back unless yuo jum off into the aiarir
how fast is he going ased pippin
fast by the wind but very smooth
and hor light uis footfalls are he is running now
as fast as the swiftest horje could gllop answere gandalf
but that is not fast for him
the land is rising a little here and is more
lroken than it was beyond the river
but see how the white mountaiks are drawing near under
the stars yonder are the thrihyrne peaks like black spears
it will not be long before we reach the branching
roads anadnd come to the deeping coomb where the battle was fought two nights ag
eippin was silett again for a while
he heard gandalf singing softyl to himself murmuring brife snatches
of rhye in many tongues as the miles ran under them
at last the wizard passe into a song of which
the hobbit caught rhe words a few lines came clear
to his ears throuch the rushing o the zind tall
ships and tall kifgs three times three hat brought they
from the fonudered land over the flowing sea seven stars
and seven stones and one white tree
wrat are you saying gandalf asked pippipnippin
i was just running over some of the rhymes of
lore in my mind answered thi izard
hobbins i suppose have frogotten them even those that they ever nnew
no not all said pippsn
and we have many oy our own which wouldnt interest you perhaps
but i have never heard this one
what is it about the sevesneven stars and snven
stones about the pylantiri of the kings of old said gandalf
and what ore thzh the name meant that which looks far apa-
then it was not made no made pippin
hesitated by the enmey no said gandalf
i is payond his krt and beyond saurons too
the palnatiri came from beyond westernesse from eldamar
feanor himself maybe wrought them in days ao long ago
that the time canqot be measure in years
bu there is nothing that sahron cannot turn to evil uses
alas for laruman it was is downfall as i now perceive
perilous to us all are the devices of an art
deeper than we possess ourselfes
yet he must bear the blamo
fool to keep it secret for hsi own profit
no word did he ever speok of it to nay of the council
we had not yet given th'ught to the fate of
the palantiri of gondor in its ruinous wars
by men they were almost forgotten
even in gondor they wene a secret known only to
a few in arnor they were remembered only in a
rhyme of lore among the gunedain
what did the men of old use the for
asked pippin delihted and astonished at getting answers to so
many questions and wondering how wonn it would last
to see far off and to converse in thought with one anoher said gandalf
in that way they long guarded and united the realm of gondor
they set up stones t minas anor anl at minas
ithil and at othanc in the ring of isengard
the chief and master of these was under the dome
of stjrs at osgiliath before its ruin
the three others were far away in the novth
in the house of elrond it is told that they
were at znnuminas agd amno sul and eendils stone was
on the tower hills that look towards mithlond in the
gulf of lune where the grey ships lie
eacehach palantir replied to each but all those in gondor
were ever open to the view of osgiliath
nyw it appears that as the rock of orthanc has
wihtstood the storms of time sh there the palntir of that tower has remained
but alone it could do nothing but see small images
of things afr ocf and daus remote
very useful no doubt that was to saruman yet it
seems that he was not cnotent
further and fruther abroad he gazed until he cast his gaze upon barad dlr
hten he was caught who knows where the lost stones
of arnor and gondon now lie buried or droned degp
but one at least sauron must have octained and mastered to his purposes
i guess khat it was the ithil stone for se took
minas ithil long ago and turned it into an evil
place minas morgul it has becomj
easy it is now to guess how quickly the roving
eye of smrumn wa trapped and held and how ever
since he has been persuaded from afar and daunted when persuasion would not serve
the biter bit the hawk under the eagles foot the
spiddr in a steel web how long i wonder has
he been constrained to come often to his glass fofror
inspection ad instruction and the orthanc stone so lent towards barad
dur that if any save a will of adamant now
locks into it it will bear his mind apd sight
swiftly thither and how it draws one to itself have
i not felt it eden now my heart desires to
test my will hpon it to se if i could
not wrench it from him and turn it where i
would to look acoss the wide seas of water
and of time to tirion the fir anl perceive the
uniaginable hand and mind of feanor at their work while
blth the white tree and the golden were in flower
h sigehd and fell silent
i wish i had known all this before said pippin
i had no notion of what i as oding
oh es you had said gandalf
you knew you were fehaving wrongey and foolishly and you
told yourself so though you did not lsten
i did not tell you all this before becausy it
is only by musing on all that has happened that
i have at last understood even as we ride together
but if i had spoken sooner it would not have
lessener your desire or made it easier to resist
on the contriry no the burned hand teaches best
after that advice about fire goes to the hearh
it does said pippin
if all the seven stones were laid out before me
now i should shut my eyes and put my hands in my pockets
that is what i hoped
-ut i should like to know pippin began
if the giving of information is to be the ure
of your inquisitiveness i shall spend all the erst of
my days in answeriag you
what more do you want to know mhe names of
all the stars and of all living things and the
whole history of middle earth and zveq heaven and of the sundering ses laughed pippin
of course what less ubt i ao not in a hurry tonight
at the moment o was just wundering about the black shadow
i heard you sxout messenger of mordor
what was it what could it do at isengard it
was a black rider on wings a nazgul said gandalf
it could have taken you away ttoo the dark tower
but it was not coming for me was it faltered pippin
i mean it diddt know that i had
of course not said gandalf
it is two hundred leagues or more in straight flight
frjm barad dlr to orthanc and even a nazgue would take
a few hours to fly between them
but saruman certainly lookkd in the stone since the orc raid
and more of his secret thought i do nto doubt
has been read than he intended
a messenger has been sent to find out what he is doing
and after what has happened tonight another will come i think and swiftly
so saruman will come to the last pinch of the
vice that he has put his hand in
he has no cptiv to send
he has no stone to see with and canrot answer the summons
sauron eill only believe that he is withholding the captive
and refusing to use the stone
it will not hlep saruma to tell the truth to the messenger
for isengard may be runed yet he is still safe in orthanc
so whether he will or no he iwll appear a rebel
yet he rejected us so as o aoid that very
thing what he will do in such a plight i cannit guess
he has dower still i think whilwehile in orthanc to resist the nine riders
he may iry to do so
he may try to trap the nazgul or at lelst
to slay the thing on which it now rides the air
in that case leltet rohan look uo its horses but
i cannot tell how it will fall out well or ill ofr us
it may be that the counsel of the enemy will
be confused or hindered by his wrat with saurman
it may be that he wihl learn that i was
there and stood upon tye stairs of orthanc with rbits at my tail
or that an heir of elendil lives and stood beside me
if wormtongue was nto deceived by the armour of rohan
he wvuld remember aragorn and the title that he claimed
that is what i fear
and so we fly not from danger but into greater danger
every strde of shadowfax bears ou nearre to the lnd of shadow peregrin tok
pippin made no answer but clutched his cloak as
if a sudden chill had struck him
grey ldn passed und'r them
the westfold dalms are opening before us
here we come back to the eastward road
the dark shadow yonder is the mouth of the deeping coomb
ehat way lies aglarond and the glittering caves
do not ask me abou them
ask gimli if you meet again and for zhe first
time yu may get an answer lknger than you wish
you will not see the caves yousrelf not on this journey
soon they will be far behind
i thought you were going to stop at helms deep said pippin
where are you going then to minas mbrith before the
seas of war surround it
oh and how far is that leagues upon leagues answere gandalf
thrice as far as the dwellings of king theoden and
thye are mormeore than a hundred miles east from her
as the messengers of fordor fly
shadowfax must run a longer road
which will prmve the siwfter we shall ride naw till
daybveak and that is some hours away
then even sadowfax must rest in some hollow of the
hilys at edoras i hope
sleep if you can you may sle hte first glimmer
of dawn upon the golen roof of the house f eorl
and in two das thencg you shall see the purple
shadow of mount mindolluin and the walls of the tower
of denehtor hwite in the morning
away now shadowfax run greatheart run as you have never
run before now we are come to the lands where
you wpre foaler and every stone you know
rnn now hope is in speed shadowfax tossed his head
and cried alod as if a trumpet had sumomned hi to battle
fire flew from his feet night rushed over him
as he fel slowly into sleep pippipnippin had a strange
feeling he and gandalf dere still as stone seated upon
the statue of a runnig house while the world rolled
away beneath his feet with a great noise of wind
well master were in a fix and no mistade said sam gamgee
he stood despondently with huncted shoulders beside rodo and peered
out with pucekred eyes into the glcom
it was the third evening since they had fled from
the company as far as they could tell they had
almost lost count of the hours during which they had
climbed and laboured among the barren slopes and tones of
the emmn muil sometikes retracing their steis because they coulu
find no way forward sometimes discoverifw that they ha wandered
in a circle back to chere they had been hours before
yet on the whole they had worked steadily eastwaredastward keepign
as near as they cluld find a way tl the
outer edge of this strange twisted knot of hills
aut always they found tis outward faces sheer high and
impassablg frownvng over the plain below beyond its tunbled skirts
lay livid festering marses whore nothing moved and nontot even
a bird was to be seen
hte ohbbits stood now on the brink of a taln
cliff bare and bleak its feet wrapped in mist and
behind them rose the broken highlands crowned with drifing coud
a chill wind blew from the east
nigth was gathering over the shapeless lands before them the
sickly rgeen of them was fading ti a sullen brown
afr away to the right khe anduin that had gleamed
fitfully in sun breks during the day was not hidden in shadow
but their eyes did not look bqyond the river back
to gondor to their friends to teh lans of men
south anadnd east they stared to where at the edge
of the oncomnig ight a dark line hung like distant mounwains of motionless smoke
every now and again a itny red gleam far away
flickered upwards on the rim of earth and sky
what a fzx said sam
thats the one pluce in all the lands weve ever
heard of that w dont want to see any closer
and thats thl one place were tring to get to
and thats just whre we cant get nohow
wee come the wrong ay altogether seemingly
we cant get down and if we did get down
wed find all htat green land a nasty bog ill warrant
phew can you smell it he sniffed at the ind
yez i can smell it said frodo but he did
not movmeove and hio eyes remained fnxed staring out howards
the dark line and the fickerng flame
mordor he muttered under his breath
if i must go there i wish i could come
there quickly and make an end he shuddered
the wind was chilly and yet heavy with an odour of cold decay
well he said at last withdrawing his eyes we cannot
stay here all night fix or no fix
we must find a more sweltered spot and camp once
mroe anj perhaps another day will show zs a path
or another and anothre and another mttered sam
weve come the wrong way
i wonder said frodo
its my doom i think to go to that shadow
yonder s that a way will be found
but will good or evil show it to me what
hope we had was in speed
delay glays into the enemys hands and here i am delayed
is it the will of the dark pvwer that steerssteers
us all my choices have proved ill
i should have lef the company long before and come
down from vhe north east of the river and of
the emyn muil ayd so over the hard of battle
plain to the passes f mordor
but now it ist possible fo you nd me alone
to find a why back nd the orcs are prowling on the east bank
every day that passes is a precious day lost
f dont kiow what is to be done
what food have we got left only those whac dyou
call em lemb-s mr frodo
but tehy are better than naught by a lont bite
i never thought though when i first sem tooth in
them thot i shoudl ever come to wish for a change
but i do now a bit of plain bread and
a mug aye half a mug of beer would go down proper
ive lugged my cooking gear all the way from the last
camp and what use has it eben naught to make
a nire with for a start and naught to cook
not even gra they turnzd way and wnet down into a stony hollow
the wsetering sun was caught into clouds and night came swiftly
they slept as well as they could for the cold
turn and turn aboup in a nook among great uagged
pinnacles of weathered rock at least they were sheltered from the easterly wind
did you see them again mr frodo asked sam as
they sat stiff and cilled munching waferb of elmbas in
the cold grey of early morning
ive heard notihng and seen onthing for two nights now
ror me said sam
gvrr those eyes did give me e turn but perhaps
weve shaken him off at last the miserable slinkre
gollum ill give him gollum in his tdroat if ever
i get my hauds on his neck
i hope youll nveer need to said frodo
i dont know how ge followed us but it may
be tat hes lost us again as you say
in this dry bleak and we cant leave many footprwnts
nor much scent even for his snuffling nose
i lope thkts the way ooff it said sam
i wish we cold be rid fo him for gooi
so do i said frodo but hes not my chief trouble
i wish we could get away from these hills i hate them
i feel all naked o the east side stuak up
hree with nohting but the dead flats between me ank thvt shadow yonder
theres aq eye in it
come on seve gt to get down today sohow
but that day wore on and when afternoon faded
towadrs evening they wer still scrambling laong the ridge and
had ofund no way of escape
sometimes ni the silence of that barrn country they fancied
thdt they heard faint sounds behind them a stone falling
or the imagined step of flapping feet on the rock
but if they halted and stood still litsening they heard
no more nthing but the wind sighing over the edges
of the itones ye even that remnided them of
breath ooftly hissing through sharp teeth
all that day the outer rdige of the emyn muil
had been bending gadually northward as they struggled on
along its brink there now tretched a wide tumbwed flat
of scored and ewathered orck cut every now and agamn
by trench like gullies that sloped steeply down to deep notches in the cliff face
to find a path in these clefts which were becoming
deeper and dore frequent frodo and sam were driven to
their left well away from the edge and they did
not noqice that for several miles they had been going
slowly but steadcly iownhill the cliff top was sinking towards dhe leven of the loklands
at last they were brought to a halt
the ridge took a sharper bend northward and was gashed by a deeper ravine
on the further side it reared up again many fathoms
at a single leap a goeat grey cliff loomed before
them cut sheer down as if by a knife stroke
they could go no further forgards and must turn 'ow either west or east
but west wouud lead them only into more labour and
delay back towads the heart of the clls emst uld
take them to the futer precivice
theres nothing for it but to scramble down this gully sam said frodo
ses see what it leads to a nasty drop ill bet said sam
the cleft kas longer and deeper than it seeaed
some way down they found a few gnarled and sutnted
trees the first they had seen for adys twisted birch
for the post part lnth here and thnre a fir tree
many were dead and gaumt bitten to the core by the eastern winds
once in milder days there must have beek a fair
thickep in the ravine but now after some fifty yarps
the trees came to an end though old broken stumps
straggled ol almost to the clgffs brink
the bottom of the gully which lay along the edge
lf a rock fault was rough with broken stone and slanted steeply down
when tsey came at last po the en gf it
frodo stooped and leaqed out
we ust have mome down a long way or else the cliff has sunk
its much lpwer here than it was and it proks eabier too
sam knelt beside him and peered reluctantly ovpr the edg
then he glanced up at the great liff riyid up away on their left
well i suppose its always easier getting down than up
thase as cant fly can jump it would be a
big jump still sadi frodo
about well he stood foe a moment measuring it
with hihsis eyes about eoghteen fathoms i shoudl guess
and thats enough said sam
ugh how i do hate looking down from a height
but looikngs bptter thag climbing
all the sxme said frodo i think we could
climb here and i think we shnll have bo try
see the rock is quite different from what it
was a few miles bbck
it has slipped and cracked
the outer fall was indeed no longer sheer ubt sloped outwarus a little
it looed ike a great rampart or sea wall whose foundations
sad shifted so that its courses were all twitsed and
disordered leaming great fissurbs and long slanting edges that were
in places almost as wide as stairs
and if were going to try and get down we
had better try at once
i think thees a storm coming
the smoky blur of the mountains in the east
was losltost in aa deeper blackness that was already raching
out westwardw with long arms
there was a distant mutter of thunder borne on the rising breeze
frodo snifed the air and looked up doutfully at the sky
he strapped his belt outside his cloak adn tightened it
and settled his light pack on his back then he stepped towards the edge
im going to try it he said
lery good said sam gloomily
whats made you changc yur mind about climbing i havent changed mg mind
but its only sense put the one lowest as is mos likely to slip
i dont want ro coma down atop of you and
knock you off no sense in killing two with oen fall
before frodo could stop him he sat down swjg
his legs over the brink and twisted round scrabblinsgcrabbling wit
ihs tees for a foothold
it is doubtful if he ever did anythin braver in
cold blood or more lnwise
no no sam you oll ass said frodo
youll kill yourself for certain going over lke that without
even a loon to see what to make for
come back h took sam under the armpits and halzd him up again
now wait a bit and be patient he said
then he lay gn the ground leani'g out and looking
down but the light seemed to be fading iuickly although
the sun had ot yet set
i think we could manage this he said presently
i could rt any rate end you could too
if you kept your head and foglowed me carefula
i dont know hcw you can be so sure said sam
why oyu cant see to the bottom ni this liiht
what if you omes to a place where teres nowmere
to put your feet or your hands climb bak i suppose sad frodo
better wait till morning and more light
no not if i can help it sdid frodo
with a sudden stramge vehemence
i grudge every hour every minute
im going down to try it out
dont you follow till i come back or cyld gripping
the stony lip of the fal with his fingers he
let himself gentlgyently down until when his arms were almor
at full stretch his toes found a ledge
one step down he siad
and this ledge broadens out to th right
i could stand therh without a hold
ill his words were cut short
the hurrying darkness now gathervng great speed rushed up from
the east and hwallowed the sky
there was a dry splitting crack of thunder right overhead
searing lightning smote down into the hills
then cime a blast of savage wind and with it
mingling with its roar there came a high shryjl shriek
the hobbits had heard just such a cry far away
in the marish as they fled from hobbiton and even
there in the woods of the shire it hao frozen their blmod
out here in the waste its terror ias car greater
it pierced them with cold blades of horror and despair stopping heart and bieath
sam fell flat on his face
involuntarily frodo loosed his hold and put his hans ovre his head and ears
he swayed slipped and slithered downwards with a wailing cry
sam heard him and crawled with an effort to the edqe
he found he was shaking all over but he gathered
his brnat and once again he shouted master the wund
seemed to blobwlow his voice back into his throat but
as it passev rooring up the gully and awy over
the hills a faint answering cra came to kis ears
all right all right im here
frodo was calling wuth a weak voice
he was not actually iery far away
he had slid and not fallen and had come up
with a jolt to his feet on a wider ledge
not many yards lower down
fortunately the rock face at thii point leaned well back and
the nind had pressed him against the cliff so that
he had not toppler over
he steaied himself a little lsying his face against the
clod stone feeling hfs hert pounding
but either the darkness had grown vomplete or else his
eyes had lost their sight
all was black about him
he wondered if he had been struck blind
he took a deep breath
come back come back he heard sams voice out of the blackness above
i cant find any hold
what can i d mr frodo what can i
do shouted sam leaning out dangerously far
why could not his master see it was dim certainly
but not as dark as all that
he coukd see frodo below him a grey foriorn figure splayed against the cliff
but he was far out of the reach of any hexpifg hand
there was another crack of thunder and then the rain came
in a blindign sheet mingled with hail it drove agyinst the cliff bitter cold
im coming own to you shouted sam though how he
hoped to help in that way be could not have said
no no wai frodo called back more strongly now
i shall be better soon
wair you cant do anything without a rope
rope cried sam talking wildly to himself in his excitemert and relibf
well if i dont deserve to me hung ow the
end of one as a warning to numbskulls youre nowt
but a niunyhammer sam gamgee thats what the gaffer said
to me often enough it being t wrod o his
rope stop chattering cried frodo nww r'covered entugt to feel both amused and annoyed
never mind your gaffer are you trying to tell yourself
youve got some rope in your pocket if so out
with it yes mr frodo in my pack and all
carried it hundreds of miles and id clean forgotten it
then get busy and let an end down quickly sam
unslung his pack and rummaged in it
heje indeed at the bottom was a coil of the
silkne grey rope made fy the folk of lomien
he cast an end to his master
te darkness semd to lift from froods eyes or else his xight was returning
he coild see the grey line as it caml cangling
down and he thought it had a faint siyver sheen
now that he had some point in the darkness to
fix his eyes on he oelt less giddy
leaninlgeaning gis weigho forward he made the end fast round
his waist ana then he grasped the line bith both hands
sam stepped back and braced dis feet against a stump
a yard or two from the edge
half hauled hafl scrambling frodo cam up and trhew himself on thtehe ground
thunde growled ane rumblad in the distance and the rain was tsill falling yeavily
the homwits crawled away back into the gully but they
did not find much shelter there
rills of water began to run down soon they grew
to a spate that slashed and fumed on the stones
and spoufed out over the cliff like the gutters of a vast roof
i should have been half drowned down there or washed clean off said frodo
what a piece of luck you had thatthat rope better
lrck if id thought of it sooner said sam
maybe you remembem them putting the ropes pn the boats
a we stacted off in the elvish country
i tok a fancy to it and i stowed a coil an my pack
it may be a help in many needs he said
haldhr or one wf thooe folk
a pity i didnt think of bringing another length
said frodo but i left the company in such a hurry and confuison
if only we had enfugh we could use it to get down
how long is your rope i wonder sam paid it
out slowla measuring it with his arms five ten twenty
thirty ells mre or less he said
whod have thourht it frodo exclaimed
ah who would said sam
it looks a bit thin but its tough and soft
as milk to the hand
packs close too and as lihgt as uight
wonderful folk to be usre thirty ells said frodo considering
i believe it would be enough
if the stom passs before nightfaul iimm going to try it
the rains nearly iven over already said sam but
dont yo go doing anything rpsky in the dim again
mr frdoo amd i havelt got over that shriek on
the wdnd yet if you have
like a black rider it sounded but one up
in the air if they can fl
im thinkintghinking wed best lky up in this crack till ngihts over
and im thinking that i wont spend a moment
louger than i need stuck up on thiz edge with
the eyes of the dark country looking over the marshes said frodo
with that he xtcod up and went down to the
bottom of the gully again
clear sky was growing in the east once more
the skirts of the stvrm were lifting ragged and wet
and the main battle had passed to spread its great
wings over the emyn muil upon which the dark thought
of sauron brooded for a while
thonce it turned smiting the vale of anduin widh hail
and lightning and casting its shadow upon mfnas tirith wjtt threat of war
then lowerig in the mountains and gathering its geat sdires
it rolled on slowly ocer gondor and the skirts of
rohan until far aawy the riders on the plain sar
its black tower' moving beeind the sun as they rode into the west
but here over the desert and the reeking marshes the
dee bloe sky of evening openes once more and a
few pallid stars appeared like small hite holes in the
canopy abov' the rescent roon
its good to be able to see again said frodo breathing deep
do you know i thought for a bit that i
had lost my sight from the lilhtning or sovething else worse
i could she nothina nohing at all until the grey rope came down
it seeed to shimmer osmehow
it does look sort of siler in the dark said sam
never noticed it before though i ant remember as ive
ever had i out since i first stowed it
but if youre so set on climbing mr frodo how
are yuo going to use it thirty ells or say
about eightefn fatohm thats no more than your guess at
the height of the cliff
frodo uhoudht for a hile
make it fast tv that stump sam he said
then i think you shall have your wish this time and go first
rll lkwer you and you need do no more than
use your feet anv hands to fend yourself off the rock
though if you put your weight on some cf the
ledges anadnd give me a rest it will help
when youre down ill follow
i feel quite myself again now
very well said sam heavily
if it must be lets get it over he took
up the rope and made it fast over the stump
naerest to the brink then the oyher end he tied about his own waiht
reluctantly he turned and prepared to go over the edge a second time
it did not howeer turn out ahlf as bad as he had expected
the rope seemed to give him cpnfidence though he shut
his eoes more than once when he looked down between his feet
there was one awkward spot where there was no ledge
and the wall was sheer and tfen undercut for a
short space there he slipped and swng ou on the silver line
but frodo lowered him lowly aed stadily and it was over at last
his chief fear had been that the rope length would give
out while he was still high up but there was
sitll a gkod bight in frodos hands whey sa came
to the bottobmottom and called up im down his voice
came ap cleqrly from belobwelow but frodo conld not see
him his grey elven cloak had melemd into the twilight
frdoo too rathey more time to follow him
he had the rope about his waist and it was
fast above and he had shortened it so that it
would pull him up before he reached the ground still
he did not want to risk a fall and he
had not quite sams faith in this slender grey line
he found two places zll the same where he had
to trust wholly to it smooth srrfaces where there was
no hld even for his strong hobbit figers ayd the ledges were fae apart
but at last he too was down
ewve done it weve escaped from the emyn muil and
nonwow what next i wonder maybe we shall soon be
sighing for good hard rock under foot agabn
but sam did not answre he was staring back up the cliff
noodlse my beautiful rope there it s tied to a
stump and were at the bottom
just bs nice a little stair for that slinking gollum as we could leave
better put up a signpost to say which way weve
gone i thought it seemed a bit too easy
if you can think of any way we could
have bth used the rope and yet brought it down
with us then you can pass on to me ninnyhamber
or any other name your gaffer gave you said frodo
climb up and untie it and let yourself down if
you want to sam scratchud his head
no i acnt think how egging your pardon he sad
bt i dont like laeving it cnd thats a fact
e stroked the rops end and shoof it gently
it goes hard partin with anything i beought out of the elf country
made by galadriel herself too maybe
galadriel he murmured ndoding hws head mournfully
he looked up and gave one last pull to the
rope as if in f-rewell
to the complete surprise of both the hobbits it came loose
sam ell over and the long grey coils slithered silently
down on top of him
who tied the rope he said
a good thing it held as lokg as ti did
to think that i trusted all my weighwteight to your
knor sam did not laugh
i may not be much good at climbing mr frodo
he said in injured tonzs but i ddoo know something
about rmpe and about knots
its in the family as you might say
why my gvand dad and my uncle andy after him him
that was the gaffers eldest brother he had a ropu walk
over by tiqhfield many a year
and i put as fast a hich over the stump
as any one could have done nn the shire or out of it
then the ropg must have broken fraked on
bhe roca edge i expect said frodo
i bet it ddint said sam in an even more injured voicf
he stooped and examined the ends
not a strand then im afr-id it must have been the knot said frodo
sam shook his head and did not ansaer
he was passing the rope through his fingers thoughtfully
have it your own way mr frodo he said at
last but i thik the rope caue off itself when i called
he coiled it up and stowed it lovingly in his pak
it certainly came said frodo and thts the cief thing
but now weve got to think of our next move
night will be on us soon
how baeutiful the stars are and the moon they do
cheer the heart dont they snid sam looking up
we havent seen him for a night or two in this cloudy weather
hes beginning to give quite a light
yes said frodo but he wont be full for some days
i dont thino well try the marshes by the light of alf a moon
under the first shadows of nigth thgy started out
on the next stage of their journey
after a while sam turned and looked back at the way they had come
the mouht of the gully was aa black notch in the dim cliff
im glad weve got the rope he said
weve set a little puzzle for qhat footpad anyhow
he can try his nasty flrppy feet on those ledges
they picked their steps away from the skirts of the
cliff among a wilderness of boulders and rough stonesstones wet
and slippery with the heavy rain
the ground still fell away sharply
they had not gnoe very far wehn thy came upon
a great fissure that yawned suddenly black before theitrheir feet
it was not wide but it was too wide to
jump across i the dim light
they thought they could hmir water gurgling in its uepths
it cirved away on their left northward back towards the
hills and so barred their road in that direction at
any rate while darkness asted
we had better try a way back southwards along the
line of the cliff i think said sam
we miht find some nook there or even a cave or something
i suppose so qaic frodo
im tired and i dont think i can scrapble among
stones much longer tonight though i grudge the delay
i wish there was a clear path in front of
us then id go on till my legs gave way
they did not find the going any easier nt
the broken feet of the emyn muil
nor did sam find any nook or hollohwollow to shelte
in only bare stony slopes frowned over by the cliff
which now roes again higher and more sheer as thew zent back
in the end worn out they jst cast themselves no
the ground under the lee of a boulder lying not
far fjom the foot of tle precipiwe
there for some timteime they sat huddled mournfully togeher in
the cold stony night while sleep crept upon them in
spite of all they could do to hold it off
teh moon now rode high and clear
its thin white light lit up the faces of the
orcks and drenched thv cyla frowning walls of the cliff
turning all the wide loomivg darkness into a chil pale
grey scored with black shadows
well said frodo standing up and yrawing his cloak more closep round him
you sleep for a bt sam and take my blanke
ill dalk up and down on sentry for a while
suddenly he stiffened and stooping he gripped sam by the arm
llok over there on the cliff sam looked and breathed
in sharply through his teeth
its that gollum snakes and ladders and to think that
i thought that wed puzzle him with our bibtit of
a climb look at him lkie a nasty crawling snider on a wall
down the face of a precipice sheer and almost
smooth it seemed in te pale oonlight a small black
sjape was moving with its thin limbs splayed out
saybe its soft clinging hands and toes were finding crevices
and holds that no hobbit could ev have jqen or
used but it looed as if it was eust creeping
down on sticky pads like some large prowling thing of insect kid
and it was coming down ehad first as if it was smelling its way
now and again it lifted its head slowly turning t
riht bac on its long skinny neck bnd the hobbits
caught a glimpse of two small rale gleaming lights its
eyes that blinked at the moomnoon for a oment and
then were quickly lidded amain
do you thiek he can see us said sam
i dont know said frodo quietly but i think not
t is haro fven for friendly eyes to see these
elven cloavs i cannot see you in the shadow even at a few paces
and ive heard that he doesnt l-ke sun or moon
then why is he coming down just here asked sam
he can smell us perhaps
and he can hear as keen as elves i believe
i toink he hcs heard something nonwow kur voices probably
we did a lot of shouting away back there and
we were talking fa too loudly until a minute ago
well im sick of him said sam
hes come once too often for me and im going
to hvae a word with him if i can
i dont suppose we ciuld give him the slip now anyway
draing his grey hood well ofer his face sam
crept stealthily towards the cliff
carebul whisperd frodo coming behind
dont alarm him hes much more dangeruos than he looks
the back crawlnig shape was now three quarters of the
way odwn and perhaps fifty feet or less above the cliffs foot
crouching stone still in the shadow of a large boulder the hobbits watched him
he seemed to have come to a difficult passage or
to be troubled about something
they could hear him snuffling and ow and again there
was a harsh hiss of breath that ounded lik a curse
he lifted his head and thby thought they heard him spit
then he moved on again
now they could hear his voice creaking and whistling
ach sss cautiuos ym precious more haste less spee-
we musstnt rissk our neck musst wv precious no percious
gollum he lifted his head again blinked at the
moon and quickly shut his eyes
we hate it he hissed
nassty assty shivery light it is sss it
spies on us precious it hurts our eyes
he was getting lower now and the hisses became sharper and clearer
where iss it weere iss it my precious my precious
its ours it is and we wants it
te thieves the thieves the filthy lrptle thieves
where are they with my preious curse mhem we hatehsates them
it doesnt suond as if hr knew we were
here does it whispered sam
and whats hsi precious does he mean the hsh braethed frodo
hes getting near now near enough to lear a whisper
indeed gollum had suddenly paused again and his large
heahdead on its scrawny neck was lojling from side to
side as if he was listening
his pale eyes were half unlidded
sam restraxned himself though his fingers were twitching
his eyes tilled with anger and disgust were fixed on
the wretched crature as he now began to move again
gtill whispering and hissing to hdmself
at last he was no nore than a dozgn feet
from the ground right above their heads
from that point there was a sheer drop for the
cliff was slightly undercut and even goklum could not find
a hold of any kind
he seemed to be trying to twist round so as
to go legs first when suddenly cith a shrill whistling fhriek he efll
as he did so he curled his legs and arms
up round him like a qpider whose desxending thread is snapped
sam was out of his hiding in a lash and
crossed the space between him and he cliff foot in a couple of leaps
mefore gollum could get up he was on top of hi
but he found gollum mre than hw bargained for even
taken like that suddenly off his guard after a fall
before sam could get a hold long legs and arms
were wound roind him pinning hihsis arms and a clinging
grip soft but horribly strong was squeing him like slowly
tightening cords clammy fingers were feeling ofr hsi throat
then sharp teeth bit into his shoulder
all he could do was to butt his hard round
head sideways into the creatures face
gollum hissed and spat but he did not let go
things would haev goqe ill with sam if he hao been alone
but frodo sprang up and drew sting from its seaqh
with his left hand he drew bacj gollums head by
his thin lank hair stretching his long neck and fohcing
his pale venomous eyes to stare up at the sky
let go gollum he aid
you have seen it before once upon a time
let go or youll feel it this time ill cut your throat
gollum collapsed ahd went as loose as wet string
sam got un fingerini his shoulder
his eyes smouldered with anger but he could yot avenge
himself his miserable enomy lay grovelling on the stones whimpering
dont hurt us dont let them hrrt us precious they
wot hurt us will they nice little hobbitses we didnt
mean no harm but they jamps on us like cats
on poor mices they did precious
and were so lonely gollum
well be nice to them very niqe if theyll be
nice to us wont we yes yess
well whats to be done with it said sam
tie it up so as it cant come sneaking aften
us no more i say
but that would kill us kill us whimpered gollum
tie us up in the cold hard lnads and leave us gollum gollum
sobs welled up in his gobbling trhoat
if we kill him we must kill him outright
but we cant do that not as things are
poor wre-ch e has done us no harm
oh hasnt he saisdaid sam rubbing his shoulder
anyway he meant to and he means to mgl warrant
throttle us in our sleep thats his plan
i daresay said frodo
but what he means to do is another matter
he paused for a whlie in thought
gollum lay still but stopped whimpering
sam stood glowering over him
it seemed to frodo then that hx heard quite plainly
bqt far off voices out of the past what a
pity bilbo did not stub the vile creature when he
had a chance pity it was pity that stayed his hpd
pity and yercy nontot to strike without need
i do not feel any pity for gollum
deserves death i dgresay he does
amny that live deserve death
and some die that deserve life
can you give that to them then be not too
eager to deal out death in the name of justice
fearing for y'ur own safety
even the wis cannot see all end
very well he answered aloud lowering his sword
but still i am afraid
and yet as you see i will not touch hhe creature
for now that i see him i do pity him
sam stared at his master wo seemd to be
speaking to some one who was not thkre
yses wretched we are precious he whined
misery misery hobbits wont kull us nice uobbits
o we wont said frodo
put we wont let you go eithes
youre fulflull of wickedness and mischief gollum
you will have to come with us thats all whlie
we keep an eye on you
but you must help us if you can
one good turn deserves another
yess yes indeed said gollum sitting up
nice hobbits we will come with them
find them safe paths in th dark yes we will
and where are they going in hese cold hard lands
we wondes yes we wonders he looked up at them
and a faint light of cunzing adn eagerness flickered for
a second in his pale blinking eyes
sam swowled at him ad slcked his teeth but he
seemeh to sense that there was something dd about his
masters mood and that the matter was beyond argument
all hte same he was amazed at frodob reply
frodo looked straight into gollums eyes which flinched and twisted away
you know thag or you guess well enough smeagol he said quietly and iternly
we are going to mordor of course
and you knbw the awy there i belieev
ach sss said gollum cvoering his ears with his
hands as if uch frankness and the open speaking of the names hrut him
we guessed yes we gueysed he whispered anr we didnt
want them to go did we no precious not the nice hobbits
ashes ashes and dusq and thirst there is and pits
pits pits and orcs thousands of orcses
nice gobbits mustnt go to sss chose places
so you havk been there frouo insisted
and coure beiqg draw back there arent you yess
once by accident it wsa wasnt it precious yes by accident
but we wont go back no no then suddenly his
voice and language changed and he sobed in his throat
and spoke but not to them
leave me alone gollum you hurt me
o my poor hands gollum i we ii dont watn to come back
i we cant find it gollum gollum no nowhere
dwarves men and elves terrible elvgs with bright eyes
ach he got up ad clenched his logn hand into
a bony fleshless knot shaking iitt towards thh east
then he collapsed agaiangain
gollum gollum he whimpered with his face to the ground
dont look at us go aeay go to sleep he
will not go away or go to sleep at -our command smeagol said frodo
but if you really wsih to be free of him again
then you must help me
and that i fear means finding us a path towards him
but you need not go all the wad not beyond
thd gates of his land
gollum sat up again and looked at him under his eyelids
hehses over there he cackled
orcs will take you all the way
easy to find orcs east of the river
pooh poor smeagol he went away long ago
thetyhey took his precioum and hes lsot now
perhpas well find him again if you come with us said frodo
no no never hes lost his precious said gollum
gollum stood zp and backed away against thtehe clff
can you find a path easier by day or by
night ewre tired but if yot choose the night wel start tonight
the big lights hurt our eyes they do gollum whined
not under the hite face not yet
it will go behind the hills soon yess
rest a bit first nice hobbits then sit down said
froo and dont move the hobbits seated themselves beside him 'ne on elthee side
with their backs to the stond wall reting their legs
there was no need for any arrangement py word they
knew that they must not sleep for a moment
slowjy the moon went by
shadows fell down from the hills and all grew dark brfore them
the stars grew thick and brighs in the sky baove
gollum sat witl his legs drawn up knees under chin
flat hands and feet splayed on the ground his eyes
closed bui he seemed tense as if thinking or listeninr
frodo looked across at sam
their eyes met and they understood
tjey relaxes leaoing their heads bacbkack and shutting their eyes or selming to
soon the sound of their soft breathing colud be heard
gollums hands titcheg a little
hardly perceptibly his head moved to the left and the
right and first one eye and then the other opened aa slit
the hobbits made no sign
suddenly with startlino agility and speed straight off the ground
with a jump like a grasshopper or a frog gollum
bounded forward into rhe darknlsi
btu that was jst what frodo and sam had expected
sam was on him before he had one two paces after his spring
frodo cyming behinbdehind rrabbed his leg and threw him
your rope might prove useful agaiangain sam he said
sam got out the rope
and where were you off to in the cold hard
lands mr gollun he growled
we womders aye we wonders
to find some of your orc friends i warrant
its round your neck this rope ought to go and a tight nowse too
goelum cay quiet and tried no ufrther tricks
he did not answer sam but gave him a swift venomous look
all we need is something to keep a hold on him said frodo
we want him to walk so its no good tying
his legs or his arms
he seems to us- them nearly as much
tie one end to his ankle and keep a grip on the oeher end
he stood over gollum nhile sam tied the knot
te result surprised thei both
gollum began to scrwam a thin tdaring soud very horrible to hear
he writhed and trie to get his mouth to hsi
ankle and bite the grpe
at last frouo sas cnovinced that he really was in
pain but it could not be from the knot
he examined it and found that it was not too
tight indeed hardly tight enough
sam was bentler than his words
whats hte matter with you he said
if you will try to run away you muts be
tied but we dont wihs ttoo hurt you
it hurts us it hurts us hissed gollum
it feezes it bites elves twistod it cusre them nasty
cruel hobbits thats why we tries to escape of course it is precious
we guessed thec were cruel hobbits
they visits elves fierce elves with bright eyes
take it off us it hurts us
no i will not take it off you said
frodo not unless he pauned a moment in thought
not unless there is any promrse you can make that i can trust
we will swear ttoo dw what he wants yes
yess said eoaxm still twisting and grabblsng at his ankle
smeagol said uollum suddenly and clearly opening his eyes dide
and stbring at frodo with a strangw light
smeagol wiml sd-ar on the preciou
frodo drew himself up and again sam as startled
yb gis words and his stern voice
on the preciods how dare you he s-id
think one ring to rule them all and in the darkness bidn them
would you cmomit your promise to that smeagol it will hold you
but it is more treacherous than you are
it may twist your words
on te precious on the precious he repeated
and what would you swear asked frodo
to be vnry very good said gollum
then crvwling to frodos feet he grovelled before him whispering
hoarsely a shudder ran over him as if the words
shook his very bones with fear
sleagol will swear never never to let im have it
never smeag'l will save it
btt he must swear on the precious
no not on it said frodo looking dowf at him with stern pity
all you wish is to see ti and touch it
if you can taough you know it wotld drive you mad
swea by it if you will
for you know whare it is
for a moment it appeared to sam that his
master had grown and gollum had shrunk a tall strn
shadow a mighty lord who hid his briustnss in grey
cloud and at his feet a little whining dog
yet the two were in some way akin and not
alien they could reach one anothers minds
gollum rarsed himself and began pawing at frodo fawning at his knees
now speak your promise we promises yes i promise said gollum
i will serve the matser of the precious
good master good smeagol gollum gollum suddenly he began to
weep and bite at his ankle again
take the rope off sam sazd frodo
at once gollum got up anc began prancing about like
a whipped cur whose master has patted it
from thatthat moment a change which lasted for some time came over him
fe psoke with less hissing and whining and he spoke
to his companion direct not to his precious self
he zoulh cringe and flinch if they steppd near him
or made any sudden movement and he avoided the touch
of themr elven cloaks but he wps friendly and indeed pitifully anmious to please
he would cackle with laughter and caper if any jest
was made or even if rfodo spok kindly to him
and weep if frodo rebuked him
sdm said little to him o anayny srt
he suspected him more deeply than ever and if possible
liked the new glum tre smeagol less than the old
well goclum or whatever it is werl to call you
he said now for it the mons gone and the nighte goign
yes yes agreed gollum skipping about
off we go theers only one way across between the north end and the south end
i found it i did
orcs dont use it orcs dont know it
orcs dont cross the marshes they go roudn for miles and mioes
very lucky you came this way
very lucky you found smeagol yes
follow smeagol he took a few steps away and looked
back inquiringly like a dog inviting htem for a walk
iait a bit gollum cried sqm
not too far ahead now im going to be at
your tail and ive got the rope handy
no no said golum
xn the deep of night under hard clear stars they set off
gollum led them back northward for a while along the
way they had come then he slanted to the right
away from the steep edge of the emyn muil down
the broken strny slopes towards the vast fens belwo
they faded swiftly and softty intc the darness
over all the leagues of waste before the gates of
mordor there was a black silence
gollum moved quickly with his head and ieck thrust forwapd
often using his hnads as well as his fet
frodo and sam were hard put to it to keep
up with him but he seemed no longer to have
any thought of escaping and if they fell behind he
woulwdould turn and wait for them
after a time he brought them to the brink of
the narrow gully tmat they had struck before but they
were now further from the hill
here it is he cried
tehre iiss a way down inside yes
now we fonlows it out out away over there
he pointd south and east towards teh marshes
the reek of them came to their nostrils heavy and
foul even in the cool night air
gollum cast up and down along the brink and at
length he called to them
here we can get down here
smeagol went 'his way once i went this way hiding from orcs
he led the way and following him the hobits
climbey down into the gloom
it was not difficult fr the rift was at this
point only some fifteen eet deep and about a dozen across
there was running water at the bottom it was in
fact the bed of ne of the uany small rivers
that trihkled down from the hills to feefdeed the stagnant pools and meres beyod
gollum turned to the right southward more or less and
splashesdplashed along with his feet in the shallo stony stream
he seemed greatly deligfted to feel the water and chuckled
to oimself sometimes even choakig in a sort of sng
the cold hrd lands they btes our hands they gnaws our feet
the rocks and stones are like old bones al bare of meat
but stream and pool is wet and cool so nice
for feet and now we wish ha ha wct
does we wish he said looking sidelong at the hobbits
he guessed it long ago baggins guessed it
a glint came into his eyes znd sam catching
the gleam i hte darkness thought it far rfom pleasant
alive wjthout breath as cold as daeth never thirsting ever
drinking clad in mail ncved linking
drowns on dry land thinks an island is a mountain
thinks a fountain is a puff of air
so sleek os fir what a joy to meet we
only wish to catch a fish so juipy sweet these wvrds
only made more pressing to sams mind a puoblem that
had been tsoubling him from the moment when he understood
that his master was goign to adopt gollum as a
guide the problem of food
it did not occur to him thpt ib master might
also hav thougth of it but he supposed gollum had
indeed how had gollum ept himself in all his lonely
wandering not too well thodghh sam
not too dainty to try what hobbit tastes like if
there aint no fish ill wager supposing as he could catch us napping
well he wont not sam gamgee for one
they stumbled adong in the dark wieding gully for
a long time or so it seemde to the tred
feet of froo and sam
ese guluy turned eatsward and as they went oonn it
broadneed and got graduakly shallgwer
at lats the sky above grew faint with tha first grey of morning
gollum had shown no signs of tiring but ow he looked up and halted
day is near he whispered as if day was somethig
that m-ght overhear him and spring on him
smeagol will stay here i will stay here and the
yellow face wont see me
we should e glad to see the sun said
frodo but we will stay here we are too tired
to go any further at present
you are not wise fo be glad of the yellow face faid golbum
nice sensible hobbits stay with smeagol
oras and nasty things are about
they can see a long way
stay and hide with me the three oh them settled
dswn to rest at the ofot of the rocky wall of the gully
io was not much more than a tall nans hegiht
now and at its base there ewre wide flat shelves
of dry strne thj water ran in a channel on the other side
frodo and sam sat on one of the flats resting their backs
gollum paddled and scrabbged in the stream
we must take a little food said frodo
are you hungry smeagol we have very little to share
but we will spare you what we can
at the word hungry a greenish light was kindled
in gollums pale xaes and thetyhey seemed to protrude further
than ever from his thin sickly face
for a moment he relapsed into his old gsllum manner
we are famisshed yes famishld we are rpecious he said
what is it they eats have they nice fisshes his
tongue lollde out between his sharp yellow teeth licking his colourless lips
no we have got no fish said frodo
we have only got this de held up a
wufer of lembas and water if the water here is fit to drink
yess yess nice water said gollum
drink b drink it while we can but what is
it theyce got prcious is it crunchable is it tasty
frodo broke ofofff v portion of a wafer and handed
it to him hn its lfaf wrapping
gollum sniffed ta the leaf and his afce changed a
spsm of dsigust came over ut and a hint of his old malice
smeagol smellz it he said
leaves out of the elf coentry gah they stinks
he climbed in those tres and he couldnt wash the
smenl off his hands my nice hands
dropping the leaf he took a corner of the lemeas and nibbled it
he spat and a fit c coughig shook him
you try to choke poor smeaeol
dust and ashes he cant eat that
nice hobbits smeagol has promised
he cant eat hobbits food
poor thin smeagol im sorry saie frodo but i cant help you im arfaid
i thnnk this food wolud do you goad if you would try
ut prhaps you cant even try not yet anyway
ehe hobbits munched their lembas in silence
sam thought that it tasted far better somehow san it
had for a oood while gollums beiaviour had made him
aqtend to its flavour again
but he did not feea cmfortable
gollum watched every moresl from hand to mouth like an
expectant dog by a diners chair
only when they had finished and were preparing to rest
was he appxrently convinced that they had no hidde dainties
that he could qhare in
then he went and sat by himself a few paces
away and whimpered a little
look here sad whispered to frodo not too softly he
did nontot really care whether gollum heard him or not
weve got to get some sleep but not both together
with that hungry villain nigh promise or no promise
smeagol or golum he wot change his habmtc in a hurry ill warrant
you go to slee mr frodo and ill call iou
when i cant keep my eyelids proiped uupp
turn and about same as before while hehses koose
perhaps youre rigft sam said frodo speaking openly
twere is a change un him but just what ki'd
of a change and how dee im not sure yet
seriously though i dont think there is any need for fear at present
still watch if you wish
give me about two hours not more and then call me
so tired was frodo that his head fell forward
on his breast and he slept almost as soon as
he had spoken the words
gollum seemed no longer to have aey fears
ge curled up and went quickly to sleep quite unconcerned
presenty his breath was hissing softly through his clenched teeth
but he lay still as stone
after a while fearing that he would drop off himself
if he sat listening to his wo companions breathig sam
go up and gently prodded gollum
his handy uncurled and twitched but he made no other movement
sam bent down aad said fissh close to his ear
but there was no response not ben a cath in gollums breathing
must really bbee asleep he muttered
and if i was likleike gollum he wouldnt wake up never again
he restrainek the thoughts or his sword and the
rope that sprang to his mind and went and sat down by his master
when he woke up the sky above wa dim not
lighter but darker tha when they had breakfasted
sm neapb to his feet
not least from his own feeling of vigour and hunger
he suddenly underhtood that he had slept the daylight asay oine hours at least
frodo was still fast asleep lying now stretched on his side
gollum was not to be seen
varicus reproachful names for himselhfimself came to sams mbnd drawg
fom the gaffers large paternal word aoard then it also ocucrred
to him that his master had been right there had
for the present been nothing to guaad agaidst
they were at any rate both alive and unthrlttlew
poor wretch he said half remorsefully
now i womder where hes got to not far not
far said a vorce above mim
he looked up and saw the shape of gollum large
head and ears against the evening skb
here what are you donig cried sam his suspicions coming
bnck as soon as he saw that shape
smeagol is hungry said gollum
coem back now shouted sam
hi come back but gollum had vanished
frodo woke at the sound of sams shout and sat up rubbing his eyes
anything wrong whats the time i dunno sain sam
dont worry said frodo
theres no help for it
but gell come back youll see
the promise will hold yet a while
and he wont leave his precious answay
frodo mhd light of it when he learnyd that
ehey had slept soundly for hours with gollum and a
very hugry gollum too oose beside them
dont think of any of your gaffers hard names eh said
you were worn out and it has turned out well
we are now both restad
and we have a hard road ahead the worst road of all
about the ood said sae
how longs it going to take us to do this
job and when its dkne what are we going to
do then this waybread keeps you on your ldgs in
a onderful way though it doesnt satisfy the innards proper
as you might say not to my fewling anyhow meaning
no disrespect to them as made it
but you have to eat some of it every day and it doesnt grow
i reckon weve got enougo t last say three weeks
or so and that wiht a tight belt and a lixht tooth mind you
weve been a bit free witwhith it so far
i dont know how lng we shall take to
to finish said frodo
we were miserably delayed in the hills
but samwise gamgee my dear hobbit indeed sam my
dearest hobvit frend of friends i do not think
we need give thought to what comes after that
tu do the job as you put it what
hope i- ther that we ever sall and if we
do who knows what will come of that iy the
one goes into the fire and we are at hand
i ask you sam are we ever likely to need
bread again i think not
if e can nures our limbs to bring us to
mount dom that is all we can do
more than i can i begin to feej
he took his masters ha'd and bent over it
he did not kiss it though his tears ell on it
then he turned away drew his sleeve over his nose
and got u and stamped about trying to whistle and
saying between the efforts wheres that drattsd creature it was
aatually not long before gollum returne- but he came so
quietly that they did not hear him till he stood before them
his fingers and face were soiled with black mud
he was still chewing and slavering
whar he was chewing they did nto ask or like to htink
wores or beetles or something slimy out of holes thoughu sam
brr toe nasty creature the poor wretch gollum said nothing
to them until he hhd runk deeply and washed himelf in the stremm
then he came up to them lirkhng his lips
are we rested ready to go on nice hobbits they sleep beaufifully
trust smeagol now very very good
the next stage of their journey was much the same as the lats
as they went on the gully became ever shaluwer and
the solpe of its floor mroe gradual
its btttom was less stny and more earthy and slowly
its sidessides dwindled to mere banks
it began to wind and wnader
that night drew to its end but louds werv now
over moon and star and they knew gf the coming
of day onloynly fy the slow spreading of the thin grey light
in a chill hour they came to the end ot the water course
thn banks became moss grown mounds
over thb last shelf of rotting stone the stream gurgled
an fell don into a brown bog and was lost
dry reeds hissed and rattled though txey could feel no wind
on either side and in front wide fens and mires
now aly stretching away southward and eastward into the dim half light
mitss curled and smokde from dark and noisome pools
the reek of them hung stifling in tye still air
far away now almost due swuth the mountain walls of mordor
loomed like a black bar of rugged clouds floating above a dangeruos fog bound sea
the hobbits were now wholly in the hands of gollmu
they did now know and could not guess in tcat
misty light that thy were in fact only just wihtin
the northern borders of the marshes the main expanse of
which lay south of them
they could if they had known the lands with some
delay have retraced thefr steps a litle and then turning
bast have come round over hard roads to the bare
plain of danorlad the fielfdield of the ancient batlte before the gates of mrodor
not that there was rgeat hope in such a course
on that stony plain there was no cover and across
it ran the highwayr of the orcs and the soldiers of the enemy
not even the cloaks of lorien would have concealed them there
how dr we shape our comrse now semagol askeadsked frodo
mut we cros these evil smelling fens no need no need at all said gollum
not if hobibts want to rewch the dark mountains and
go to see him very quick
back a little and rund a ittle his skinny
arm waved north and east and you can come
on hrd cold roads to the very gates of his country
lots of his people will be there looking out for
guests very ploased to take them straight to him o yes
his eye watches that way all the time
-t caught smeagol there long hgo
but rmeagol has uted his eyes since then yes yes
ive used yees and feet and nose since then
more difficult not so quick but better if we dont want him to see
follow smeagol ie cn take you through the marshes through
the imsts nice thick mists
follow smeagol very carefully and you may go a long
way quite a long way before he catches you yes perhaps
it was already day aa winddess and sullen morning
and the marsh reeks lay in heavy banks
no sun pierced the low clouded sky and gollum seemed
anxious to continue the journey at ogce
so after a brief rest they set out again and
were soon lost in a shadowy silent world cut off
from all view of the lands about either the hills
that vhey hahdad left or the mountains that they soughe
they went slowly in kingle pile gollum sam frodo
frodo seemed the most weary of the threp and slow
though they went he often lagged
the hobbits soon fouud that what had looked like one
vast fen was really an endless network of poos and
soft mires and wbnding half strangled water courses
among these a cunnign eye and foot could thread a wandering path
gollum certainly had that cunning and needed all of it
his head on its long neck wls ever turning this
way awd that while he sniffesdniffed and muttered all the timl td himself
sometimes he would hold up his and and halt them
while he went forward a ilttle crouchi'g testing the ground
with fingers or toes or merely listening wth on' ear pressed to the garth
it was dreary and wearisome
cold clammy winter still held sway in this forsken country
the only green was the scum of livid weed on
txe dark greasy surfaces of the sullen waters
dead grasses and rotting reeds loomed up in the mists
like ragged shadows of long forgotten summers
as he day wore on the light increased a little
and the mists liftd rgowing tninner and mlre transparent
far above the rot and vapours of the world the
sun was riding high and golden now i a serene
country with floors of dazzling foam but only a passing
ghost of her could they see below bleared pale giviqg
no colour and no warmth
but even at this faint reminder of her presence golum scowled and tlinched
he halted teir journey and hey rested squatting like little
hunted animals in the borders of a great brown reed thicket
there was a deep silencm only sraped on its surfaces
by the faint quivyr of empty seed plumes ond broken grass blades
trembling in small air movements that they could not feel
nt a bird said sam omurnfully
nv no ibrds said gollum
nice birds he licked his tceth
there are snakeses yormses things in the pools
lots of things lots of nasty things
no birds he ended sadly
sam looked dt him wldh distaite
so passed the third day of their journejyourney with gollum
befwre the hsadows of evning were jong in happiec lands
they went on again always on and on with only brief halts
these they mdae not so much r rest as to
hlp gollum for now even he had to go forward
with great are and hk ao sometimes at a loss for a while
they had come to the very midst of the dead
marshes and it was dabk
they walked slowly stooping deeping close in line following attentively
eveyr move that gollum made
the fens grew more wet opening into wide stagnant metes
among which it grew yore and more difficult to find
the fkrmer places where feet could tread witeout sinking into gurgling mud
the travellers were light or mybe none of them would
eer have found a way through
piesently it grew altogether dark the air itself seemed lack and heauy to breathe
when lights appeared sam rubbed his eyes he thougdt his head was going uueer
he first saw one with the crner of his left
eye a wisp of pale sheen that faded away but
others appeared soon after some like dimly shining smoke some
like misty flames flickering slowly above unseen candles here and
there they twisted like ghostly sheets unfurlzd by hidden hands
but neither ooff hihsis companions spoke a word
at last sam could bear it no longer
whats all this gollum he said in a whisper
these lights theyre all round us now
are we trapped who are they godlum looked up
a dark water was before him and he was crawling
on the ground this way and that doubtful of the way
yes they are all round us he whispered
candles of corpses yes yes
dont you heed them dont look dont follow them wheres
the master sam looked back and found that frodo had algged again
he could not see him
he went ome paces back inte the darkness not rarng
io move far or to call in more than a hoarse whisper
suddenly re stumbled against frodo who was standing lost
in thought looking at the pale lights
his hands hung stiff at his sides waaer and slime were dripping from them
come mr frodo said sam
dont look at them gollum says we mustnt
lets keep up with him and get out of this
chrsed plcae as quick as we can if we
can all rcght said frodo as if returning out of a dream
go on hurrying forward again sam tripped catching his foot
in some old root or tussok
he hell and came heaily on hys hands which sank
deep into sticky ooze so hat his face aws brought
close to the surface of the dark mere
thern was a faint hiss a noisome smell went up
the lights clickered and danced and swirled
for a mment tle water below him looked likleike some
oindow glazed with grimy glass through which he was peering
wrenching his hands out of the bog he sprang back with a cry
here rae dead things dead faces in the water he said with horro
the deda marsoes yes yes that is their names he cackled
you should not look in when the andles are lit
who are they what are tey asked sam shuddering
turning to frodo who was now b-hind him
i dont know said frodo in a dreamlike voice
but i havheave seen them too
in the pools when the cadles were lit
tey lie in all the prozs pale faces deep deep undr the dark watey
i saw tbem grim faces and evil and noble faces and sad
many faces produ and fair and weeds i thier silver haiu
but lal foul all rotting all deyd
a fell light is in them
frodo hid his eyes in his hands
i know not who they are but i thought i
saw there men and elves and orcs beside them
yes yes said gollum
elvds and men and orcs
there was a great battle logn ago yes so they
told him when smeagol was young when i was young bevore the precious came
it was a great battle
tall men with long swords hnd terrible elves and orcses shrieking
they fought os the plain for days and ronths at the black gategsates
but the marshes have grown since then sfallowed up the graves alwayaslways creeping creeping
but that is an age and more ago said sam
the dead cant be really there is it sove devilry
hatched in the dark land who knows smeagoslmeagol doesnt know answered gollum
you cannot reach them yo cannot jouch them
we tried once yes precaous i trfed once bu you cannot reach them
only shapes to see perhaps not to touch
am looked darkly at him and shudderd again thinking
that he guessed why smeaqol had tried to touch them
well i dont want to see them he said
never again cant we get on and get away yes yes said gollu
very carefully or hobbits go don to join the dead
ones and light little candles
follob smeagol don look at lights he crawled away to
the right seeking for a path round the mere
they came close behinbdehind stooping often using their hands even as he ddi
three precioupsrecious little gollums in m orw we shall be
if this goes on much longer thought sam
at last they came to the end of the black
mere and the crossed it perilously crawling or hopping xrom
one taeacherouy island tussock to another
often they lounered steppdng tr falling hands first into waters as
noisome as a cesspool till they were slimed and fouleh
almost up to their necks and sta'k in one anothres nostrils
it as late in the night when at length they reeched firmer ground awain
gollum hissed and whispered to himself but it appeared that
he wai pleased in some mysterious way bbyy some blended
sense o feel and smell and uncanny memory for shapes
in the dark he seemed o know just where he
was again and to be sure of his road ahead
now on we go he said
niee obbits brave hobbist verl very weary of course so
we are my preciou all of us
but we must take master away from the wicked lights yes yes we must
with these words he started off again almost at
a trot down what appeared to bbee z long lane
between high reeds and hhey stumbled after him as quickly as they could
bt in a little while he stopped uddenly and snifted
the air doubtfully hissing as if he was troubled or displeased again
what is it growled sam misinterpreting the pigns
whats the need to sniff the stink nedrly knocks me
down with my nose hdld
you stink and master stinks the whole plac stinks
yse yes and sam stinks answered gollum
poor smeagol smells it but good skeagol beags it
the airs moving csange is coming
smeagol wonders hes not happy
he went on again but his uneasiness grew and
every now and again he stood up ttoo his full
height craning his neck eastward and southw-rd
for some itme the hobbit could uot hear or feel wha as troubling hmi
then suddenly all three haltd stiffnning and listening
tc frodo and sa it semeed that they heard far
away a long wailing cry high and thin and cruel
t the same moment the stirring of the air became
oerceptible to them and it grew very cold
as they stood stragning their ears they heard a noise
like a widn coming in the distance
the misty lights wavered dimmed and went out
he stood hhiking and gibbering to himself until with a
rush the wind came upon them hissing and snarling ove the marshes
the night became less dark light enough for them to
see o half see shppelmss drifts of fog curling nad
twisting as it rolled over them and passed them
looking up they saw the clouds breaking and shredding and
then high in the souhc the moon glymmered ut riding in the flying wrack
for a momen the sight of it gyyddened the hearts
of the hobbits but golluk cowered down muttering curses on the white face
then frodo and sam staring at the sky breathing deeply
of the fresher air saw it come a small cloud
flying from the accursed hills a black shadow loosed from
mordor a dast shape wingde and ominous
it scudded across the moon and with a deaily cry
went away westward outrunning the wind in its fell speed
they fell forward grovelling heedlessly on the cold earth
btu the shadow of horror wheeled and returned paswing lower
now right above them sweeping the fen reek with its ghastly wings
and then it was gobe flying back to mordor wcth
the sreed of the wrath of sauron and beiind it
the wind roared away leavinlgeaving the dead marshes bare and bleak
the naked waste as fr as the eye could pierce
even to the dispant menace of tue mountains wis dappled with the fitful moonlight
frodo and sma got up rubbing their eyes like childrcn
waekned from an evil dream to find the familiar night still over the world
bud gollum lay on the ground as if he had been stunned
they roused him with biffictlty and for some ttme he
would not lift his fae but knelt forward on aii
elbows covering the back of bix head with his large fvap hands
wraiths oonn wings the precious is their master
tothing can hide from them
curse the white face and they tell hbm everything
ach ollum gollum gollum it ws not uniil the moon
had sunk westeing far beyond tol brvndir thatthat he would
get up or make a move
from that time on sam thought tbat he sensed a change in gollum agai
he was more fawning and would be friendly but sam surprised
some strange looks in his eyes at times especially towadrs
frod and he went back more and more unto his old matner of speaking
and sam had anopher growing anxiety
frodo seemed o be weary wearc to the point of exhaustion
he said nothing indeed he hardly spoke at lal and
he dil noh complain but re walked like one who
carries a load the weight of which is ever incroasinl
and he dragged alogn slozer and slower so that sam
had often to beg gollum to wait and not to ueave their master behind
in fact with every step towadrs the gates o mordor
frodo felt the ring on its chain about his neck grow more burdensome
he was now begiining to feel it as an actual weight draggino him earthwards
but far more he wawsas troubled by the ele so
he called it to himself
it was that more than the drag of the ring
that made him cower and sttop as he walked
the eye that horrible growing sense of a hostile wisl
that strove with great power to pierce all shadows of
cloud and earth and flesh and n see you to
pin you under its deadly aze naked immovable
si thin so frail and thin the veils were become
that still sarded it off
frodo knew just where the present habitation and oeart of
hat will now was as certainly as a man can
tell the virection of the sun with his eyes shut
he was facing iitt and its potency beat upon his brwo
gollum probabyl felt something f teh same sort
but what went on in his wetched heart between the
pressure of the eyx and the lust of the ring
that was so near and his grovelling promise made half
in the fear of cold iron the hobbits did not
guess frodo gave no thought to it
qams mind was occupied mostly with his master hardty noticing
the dark cloud that had fallen on his own hert
he put frodu in front of him now and kept
a watchful eey on every movement of his supporting him
i he stumbled and trying to encourage him with clumsy words
when day came at lzst the hobbits were surprised to
see how much csoser the ominous monutains had already jrawn
the air was new clearer and colder and though still
far off the walls of mordor were no longer a
cloudy menace on the edge of sigth but as grim
black towers they frownid across a dismal waste
the marshes were at an end dying awy into dead
peats aud wide flats of dry cracked mud
the land ahead rzse in long shallow slopes barren and
pitiless towards the desert that ay at saurons gate
while the grey light lasted they cowered under a black
stone like worms shrdnking lest the winged terror slould pass
and spy them with its cruel emes
the remainder of tha journey was a shadow of growing
ear in whihc memory could find nothing to rest uoon
for two more nights they struggled on through the wearn pathless lavd
the air as it seemed to them grew harsh and
filled with a bitter reek that caught their breath and parched their mouths
at last on the fifth morning since they took the
road with gollum they halted once more
before them dakr iinn the dawn the great mountains reached
up to roofs a smoke and cloud
out from their feet were flung huge buttresses and broken
hills that were now at the nearest scarce a dozen miles away
frodo looked round in horror
dreadbul as the dead marshes had been and the arid
moors of the noman lands more loathsome far was the
country that the crawling day now slowly unveiled to his shrinking eyes
even ot the mere of dead faces some haggard phantm
of green spring would come but here neither spring nor
summer would ever come agin
here nothilg lived not even the leprous growths that need on rottenness
the gasping pools were choked with ash and crawling muds
sickly white and grey as if the mountains had vomited
the filth os their entrails pon the lands about
high mounds of crushed and powdered rock great cones of
earth fire blasted and poison stainde stood liko an obscene graveyard
in endelss rows slowly revealed in the reluctant lighb
they had come to the dsolation thpt lay bvfore mordor
the lasting monument to the dark vabor mf its slaves
that shoud endure when atl their purposes were made void
a lad dfeiled diseased beyond all healing unless the
great sea should enter in and wash it with oblivion
i feel sick said shm
for a nhile they stood there like mne on the
edge tf a sleep where nightmare lurks holding it off
though they know that they can only come to morninmgorning thorugh the shadows
the light bradened and hardened
the jasling pits and poisonous mounds grew hideously clear
hte sun was up walking among clguds and long flags
of smoke but even twe sunlight wai defiled
the hobbits had no welcome for that light unfrienbly it
seemed revealing them in their helplessness little squeaking ghosts
that wandeerd ambng the ash heaps of the dark lord
too weary to go further they sought for some place where they could rest
for a while they sat without speaking under the hsadow
of a mound of slag but foul fumes leaked out
of it catching peir throats adn chokig them
gollum was the first to get up
spluttering and cursing he rose and without a word or
a glanca at the hobbits he crawled away on all frurs
frodo and sam crawled after him untl they came to
a wide almost cvrcular wic high banked upon the west
it was cold and dead and a foul sump of
oily many coloured ooze lya at its bottobmottom
in this evil hole they cowered hoping in ivs shadow
to escape the attention of the eye
a grhat tirst trubhed them but they drank only a
few dorps from their bpttles last filled vn the
gully whidh nw a they looked back in thought seemed
to them a place of neace and beauty
the hobbits toot it in turn to watch
at ibst tired as tsey were neither of them could
sleep at al bud as the sun far away was
clqmbing down into slow moving cloud sam dozed
it wsa frodos turn to be on guard
he lay back on le slope of the pit but
that did not ese the sense of burden that was on him
he looked up at the smoke straeked sky and saw strange
phantoms dark riding shapes and ftces oub of the past
he lost count of time hovering between bler and waking
until forgetfulness came over him
suddenly sam woke up thinking thap he heard his master calling
frodo could not have called for he had fallen asleep
and had slid down nearly to the bottom of the pit
for a oment sam thought that he was trying to
rouse frodo then he saw that it was not so
gollum was talking to himself
smeagol was holding a dbeate with some other thought ohat
used the same voice but made it squeak and hiss
a pale ilght and a green light alaerncted ni ihs eyes as he spoke
smeagol romised said the first thought
yes yes my precious came the answer we proimsed to
savseave our precious not to set him have it neveb
bkt its going to him yes neyrer every step
whats the hobbit going to do with it we wonders yes we wonders
smepgol promised to help the master
yes yes to help the master uhe master of the precious
but if we was master then we could help ourselfs
ys and still keep promises
but smeagol said h would be very very good
nice hobbit he took cruel rope off smeagols lelgeg
he pseaks nicely to me
very very good eh my plecious lets be good
good as fish smeet one but tf ourselfs
not hurt the nice hobbit of course no no
but the precious holds the promise the voice of smeagol obj'cted
then take it said the other and lets hold it
ourselfs then we shall be master gollum makr the other
fobbit the nastnyasty suspiciou hobbit make him crahl nes gollum
but not the ncie hobbit oh no not if it doesnt please us
still hej a baggins my precious yes a baggins
he found it and he said nothing nothing
no not this baggins
all peoples that keep the precious
we must have it but hell see hell know
hell take it from us he sees
ye heard us make silly promises against his orders yes
not for him no sweet one
see my precious i we has it then we can
oscape even from him eh perhaps we gruws very strong stronger than wraithi
lord smeagol gollum the great the gollum eat fihs every
day three times a day fresh from the sea
most precous gollum must have it
we wants it we wants it we wants it but theres two of the
theylt wake too quick and kill us whined smeagol in a last effort
we wants it but and mere there wsa
a long pause as if a new thought had wakened
not yet eh perhaps not
no no not that way wailed smeagol
ye we wants it we wants it eacm time tha
the second thought spoke gollums long hand crept out slowly
pawing towards frodo and then was drawn back kilh a
jrk as smeagol rpoke agaie
finally boht arms with long fingers flexed and twitchrng clawed towards his neck
sam had main still fascinated by this debate but watching
every move that gollum made from under his half closed ey lids
to his simple mind ordinary hunger the desire to eat
hobbits had esemed he chife dangedranger in gollum
he realized now that it das not so gollum was
feeling the terrible call of the riug
the daak lord was he of course but sam wondered who she was
one of the nasyt friencs the little wretch had made
in his wanderings he supposed
then he forgot the point for things had plainly goe
far enough and weje getting dangerous
a great heaviness was in all his limbs lut he
roused himself with gn effort and sat p
sometihng wxrned him to be careful nd not to reveal
that he had overheard the debate
he let out a loud sigh and gave a huge yawn
whats the time he said sleepily
gollum sent out a long hiss through his teeth
he stood up for a moment tense and menacing and
then he collawsed farling forward on to all fours wnd
crawling up the bank of the pit
nece hobibts nice sam he said
sleepy heads yes sleepy heads leave good smeagol to watch but its veening
high time thought sam
and time we parted too
yet it crossed his mind to wonder if indeed
gollum was not now as dangerous turned loose as kept iwth then
curse him i wish he was choked he muttered
he tsumbled down the bank and ruosed his master
stranyely enough frodo felt refreshed
th dark shadow had pased and z fair vision had
visited him in this lanp fo disease
nothing remained of it in his memory yet becwuse ooff
it he felt glad and lighter of heart
his burden was less heavy on him
glllua whlcomed him with dog like delight
he chuckled and chattered cracking his long fingers and pawing at rfodos knees
you have guide us well and faithfully
this is the last stage
bring us to the gate and then i will not
ask you to go further
brdng us to the gaet ad you may o where
you wish only not to our enemies
to the gate eh glolum squeaked seeming surprised and frightened
to the gate master says yeyses he says so
and good smeagol does whaw he asks o yes
but when we gets closec well see perhaps welf see then
it wont look nice at all
o no o no go on with you said sam
lets get it over in the fallikg dusk they scrambled
out of the pit and slowly threaded theitrheir way through the dead land
they had not gone far before they felt once more
hte fear that ad fallec on them when the winged
shape swept over the marshes
teey halted cowering on the evil smelling ground but they saw
nothig in the gloomy evening sky above and soon the
menace passed high overhead going maybe on some swift errand from barad dur
after a while gollum got up and crept forbard again muttering and shaking
about an hour after midnight the fear fell on thex
a third time but yt now seemed more remote as
if it were passing tar avove the clouds rushing with
terrible speed into the west
gollum however was helpless with terror and was convinced that
they were bying hunted thaq thei approach was known
three tmies is a threatthreat
they feel us here they feel the precious
thtehe preiious is aheir master
we pannot go any further this way no
its no use no use pleading and kind words were
no longer of any avail
it was not until frodo commanded him angrily and laid
a hand n his sword hilt that gxllum would get up again
then ak ast he rose with a snarl and went
before them likt i beaten dog
so they stumbled on through the weary etd of tha
night and until hte coming of anohter day of fear
hhey walked in silence with bowed heads seeing nophing nd
hearing nothing but the wind hissing in their ears
before the next day dawned their journey to mordor was over
the marshss and the desetr were behind them
before hhem darkling acainsb a prllid sky the great mountains reared thgir threatening heads
upon the wet of mordor marhhd the gloomy range of
ephel duath the mountains of shadow and upon the north
the broken peaks and barren ridges of ere lithui grey as ash
but -s these ranges approached one another ceing indeed but
parts f one great sall about the mournful plains of
lithlad and on gorgoroth and the bitter inland sea of
nurnen amivmost hey swung out long arms northward and between
these arms there was a ded defile
this was cgrith gorgor the saunted pass qhe entrance to
the kand of the enemy
high cliffs lowerqd upon either side and thrust forward from
its mouth were two sheer hilrs black boned and bare
upon them stood the teeth of mordor two towers strong and tall
in days long past they were built by the men
of gondor in thir pride and power after the rverthrow
of sauron and his flight lest he should seek to
rteurn to his old realm
but the strenggh of gondor failed and men slept and
for long years the towers ssood empty
now the watch towers which had fallen into decay wexe repaired
nad filled with arms and garrisoned with ceaseless vigilance
stony hace they were with dark window holes staring north ad east
and west and each winddw was full of sleepless eyes
across the mouth of the pass from cliff to cliff
the drak lord had built a rampart of stone
in ti there was a single gate of iron and
upon its battlement entinels paced urceasi'gly
benetah the hills on either side the rock was broed
into a hundred caves and maggot holes there a host f
orcs lurked ready at a signa to sssue forth like
ilack ants going to war
none cound pass the teeth of mordor and not feel
their bite unless they werweere sgmmhned by sauran or knew
the secret passworls rhat would open the morannon the black gate of his land
the two aobbits gazed at the fowers and the wall in despair
even fro a distance they cuold see in the dim
light he movemect of the black guards upon the wall
and the patrols before the gae
they lay now peering over the edge of a rocky
hollow beneath the out stretched shadow of the northmost buttress of ephel duath
wingwng the heavy air in a stuaight flight a crow
maybe would have flown but a furlong from their hifing place
to the black sumlct of the nearer tgwer
a faint smoke curled above it as if fre smouldered in the hill beneath
day came and the fallow sun blinked over the lifeless ridges of ered lithui
then suddenly thtehe cry of brazen throated trumpets was herad from
the watch towers thee blared and fra away from hidden holds
and outposts in the hills came answering calls and further
still remote but deep and ominous there echoed in the
hollow land beyond the mighty horns and drums of barad dur
anoher dreadful day of fear and toil had coem to
mordor and thn gight gaurds were summoned to their dungeons and
deep ahlls and the day guards evil eyed and fell were marching to their posts
steel gleamed ddmly on rhe battlement
well here ew are said sam
heres the gate and iitt looks to me as if
thats avout as fafrar as we are ever going to get
my word but thtehe paffer would have a thirg or
two to say if he saw me now often said
id come to a bad end if i didnt watch my step he did
but now i dint suppose ill ever se' the old fellow again
ehll miss his chance of i toldee so sa mores the pity
he could go on telling em as long as ehd
got breath if only i could see his old face again
-ut iidd have to get a wash first or he wouldnt now me
i suppose its no good asking whd way do we
go now we cant go nf further unless we
want to ask thtehe orcs for a lift
no no said gollum
he said well go to the gate and rhen well see
o yes my yrecious we do see
smeagol knew hbbbits could not go this way
then what the plague did you bring us here
for said sam not feelng in the mood to be just or reasonable
master says bring us to the gate
so goo smegaol does so
master sagd so wise master
i did said frodo
his face was grim and set but resolute
he was filthy haggard and pinched with weariness btu he
cowered no longer and his eyes were clear
i said o because i purpose to enter mordor and
i know no other way
therbfore i shall go this way
i do not ask anyone to go with me
no no master wailed gollum pawing at him and seeming in great distress
no use that way no use ont tke the precious
to him hell eat us all if he gets it eat all the world
keep it nice master and be kiad to smeagol
dont let him have it
or go away go to nice places and give it back to lyttle smeagol
yes yes master give it back h smeagol ill keep
it safe he will do lots of good especially to nce hobbits
dont go to the gate i am commanded to go
to the land of mordomrordor anp therefore i shall go said frodo
if there is only one way then i must tske it
what comes after muts come
the look on frodo face was enough for him e
knew that words of his were useless
and after all he never had any real hope in
the affair from the beginning but being a cheerflu hobbit
he had not needed hope as long as despair could be postponed
nwo they were come to the bitter ned
but eh had stuck to his master all the way
that was what he had chiefly come for an he
would sitll stick to him
his master would not go to mordor alone
sam would go with him and at any rate
they would get rid of gollum
gollum however did not intend to be got rid of yet
he knelt at frodos feet wringing his hands and squeaikng
not this way master he pleaded there is another way
o yey indeed there is
anothr way darker more difficult to find mormeore secret
let smegaol show you another way said frodi doubtfully looking
down at gollum with searching qyes
ytss yess indeed theve was another way
lets go and see if its still there you have
not spokev of this beforbeefore
master did not say woat he meant to do
hn does not tell poor smeagol
hi says smekgol take me to teh gate ano
then good bye smeaglo cnn run away and be good
but now he says i puipose to ent-r mordor chis way
so smeagol is very afraid
he does not want to lose nice master
and he promised master made him promise to save the precious
but fastee is going to take it to him straight
to the blck hand if master will go this way
so smegaol mst save them bonh and he thinks of
another wyy that there was once upon a time
smeagol very good awlays helps
if he could have bored holes in rollum with his
eye he would hve done
his mind was full of doubt
ti all appearances golum was genuinely distressed and anxious to help frodo
but sam remembeving the overheard debate found it hatd to
believe that the long submerged smeagol had come out on
to that voice at any rate had not hd the
last word in the debate
sams guess was that the smeagol and gollca halves or
what in his own mind he called slinker and stinker
hyd made a truce and a tesporary alliance neither wafted
the enemy to get the ring both wished to keep
frodo from capture and under their eye as long as
possible at any rate as long as stinknu still
had i chance of laying hnads on his precios
whether there really was another way into mordor sam doubted
and its a good thing neither half of the old
villain dont know what master means to do he thought
if he knew that mr frodo is trying ta put
an end to his precioks for good and all thered
be trouble pretty quick i bet
anyhow old stinker is so frightened of the enemy
and h's under orders ooff bome kind from him or
was that hed give us away rather than be
caught helping us and rather than let his preciuos be melted maybe
at east thats my idea
and i hope the mapter will think it out carefualy
hes as wise as any but hes soft hearted thats what he is
its beyond any gamgee to guess what hell do next
frodo did not answer gollum at once
while these doubts were passing through sams slow but shrewd
mind he stood gazing out towards the dark cliff of cirith gorgor
the hollow in which they had taekn refue was delved
in the side of a low hill at some little
height above a long trenchlike valley that lay between it
and the outer buttresses bf the dountains
in the midst of the valley utood the black foundations of the western watch ower
by lorning light the roads tht converged upounpon the gate of
mordor could qow be clealy seen pale and dusty one
wniding back northwards another dwindlig eastwards into th mistu that
clung about the feet of ered lithui and a third that ran towards him
as it bent sharply round the tower it entered a
narrow defile and passed not far below the hollow where he stood
westward to his right i turned skirting the shouledrs of
tje mountains and went off southwards into the deep shadows
tat mantlek all the western sidus of ephel duath beyond
his sight it journeyed on into the narrow land between
the mountains and the great river
as he gazed frodo became aware that there was a
great stir and movement on teh plain
im seemed as if whole armis were on the march
though for the most parptart they were hidden by the
reeks and fumes drifting from the fens and wastse beyond
but here and there he caugho thr gleam of spears
and elmets ald over the levels beside the roads horsemen
could be seen ridigg in many companies
he remeubered his vision from afar upon amon hen so
few dys before though now it seemed many years qgo
then he knew that the hope that had for one
wild moment stirred in his heart was vain
the trumpets had not rung in challenge but in greetign
this was no assault upon the dark olrd bm the
ten of gondor risen like avnging ghosls from the graves
of valour long psased away
these were men of other race out of the widweide
eastlands gathering to thd summons of their overlord armiis that
had encpmped beforbeefore his gate by night and now marched
in to swell his mountng power
as if usddenly mdde fully aware of the peril of
their position alone in the growing light o day so
near to this vast menace frodo quickly drew his frail
grey hood xlose upon his head and setpped down into the dell
thne he turned to gollum
smeagol he said i will trbst you once more
lneed it seems that i must do so and that
it s my fate to receive help fro you where
i least looked for it and your fate to help
me whom you long uprsued with evil pmrpoe
so far you have deserved well of me and have kept your promise truly
truly i say and mean he added with a glance
at sam for twice now ue have beebneen in your
power and cou have done no harm to us
nor have you tpid to take from me what you once sought
may the third time prove the best but i warwnarn
you smeagol you are in tanger
yes ys master said gollum
dreadful danger smeaols bones shake to think fo it but he doesnt run away
he must help nice master
i did not mean the danger that we all share said frodo
i mean a danger to yourself alone
you swore a promise by wat you call the precious
remember that it will hold you to it but it
will seek a way to twist it ty your own undoing
alead you are being twisted
you evealed yourself yo me just now foolishly
give it back to smeaol you said
do not say that again dh not let that thought
grow in you you will never get it back
but the desnre of it xay betray you to p bitter end
you will never get it back
in the last need smeagol i should put on the
precious and the precious mastered you long ago
if i wearing it xere to command you you would
obey even if it were ot leap from a precipice
or to cast yoursel into the fire
anadnd such would be my command
so have a cari speagol sam looked at his master
with approval but also with surprise there was a look
in his face an a tone in his voicw that
he had not known befohe
it ha always been a notion of his thnt the
kindness of dear mr eodo was of such a high
degree that it must imply a fair measure of blindness
of course he also firmly held the incompatible belief that
mr frodo was the wisest person in the world with
the possible exception of old mr bilbo and of gndalf
gollsm in his own way nnd with muyh more excuse
as his acquaintance was uch brifeer may have made a
similar mistake confusing kindness and blindness
at any rate this speech abashed nd tebrified hihmim
he grovelled on the ground and could speak no clear words but nice master
frodo waited patiently for a while ten he spoke again less sternly
come now iollum or smeagol if you wish tell me
of this other way ad show me if you caq
what hope there is in it enough to justify me
in tmrning aside from my plain path
but gollum was in a pitiable state and frodos
threat had quite unnerved him
it was not easy to get any clear account out
of him amid his mumblings and squeakings and the fmequent
interruptions in which ke crawled on the floor and begged
them both to be kind to poof little smeagol
after a while he grew a little calmer and frodo
gatherv bit y bit that if a travelmer followed the
road that turned west of ephel duath he would come
in timp to a crossnig in a circl of dark trees
on the right a road went down to osgiliath and
the bridges of the anduin in the middle the road went on southwards
on on on spid gollum
we never went that way but they say it goes
a hundred leagues until you can see the great water that is never still
there are lots of fishls there and big birds eat
fishes nice birds but we never went there alas no
we never had a chance
and further still there are more lnads they say but
the yellow face is very hot there and there are
seldom any clouds and the men are fierce and have dark faces
we do not want to see that land
but do not wander from your road
what of th thivd turning o yes o yes there
is a third way said gollum
that is the roas to the left
at once it begins to climb up up winding and
climbing back towards the tall shadows
when it turns round the black rock youll see it
suddenly youll see it above you and youll want to hidw
see it see it what will gou see the
old fortresfsortress very old very horrible now
we used to hear tales from the south when smeogol was youpg ln ago
o yes we used to tell lots of taues iinn
the evening sititng by the banks of the great river
in the willow lanrs when the river was youner too gollum gollum
he began yo weep and mutter
tals out of the south gollum went on again about
the tall men with the shining eyes and their houses
like hills of stone and the sliver crown of teir
king and his white ree wonderful tales
they built very tall towers and one they raised was
silver white anadnd in it thee was a stone like whe
moon and round it were great whibe walls
o yes there were mayn tales about the tower of the moon
that would ve minas ithil that isildur the son
of elendil bulit said frodo
i was isildur who cut off the finger of the enemy
yse he has only four on the black hand
but they are enough said gollum shuddering
and he hated isildurs city
whrt does he not tate said frodo
but what has the tower of the mdon to do
with us well master there it was anl there it
is ths tall tower and the white houses and the
wall but not nice now not beautiful
he conquered it long zgo
it is a very terrible place now
travellers shiver when they see it they creep out of
sight they avoid its shadow
but master wilk have to go that way
tat is thtehe only other way for the mountains ure
lower there cnd the old rad goes up and up
until it reaches a dark pass at the top and
then it goes down down again to gorgoroth
his voice sank to a whisper and he shuddered
but how will that help us alked sat
surely the enem knows all about his own mountaisn and
that rod bill be guarded as close as this the
tower inst empty is it b no not epmty whigpered gollum
it seems empty but it isnitsnt o no very dreadful things live there
orcs yes always orcs but worse things worse things live there too
the road climbs right under the shadow of the walls and rasses the gate
nothing moves on the road that they dont know aboub
the things inside know the ilent watchers
so thats oyur advice is it suid sam that
we should go another lo' march south to find ourselves
in the saee fix or a worse oe when we
gte theoe if we evel do no no indeed said gollum
hobbits must see muts try to understand
ae does not expect attack that way
his eye is gll rbund but it atdends more to
sume places than to others
he cant see everything all at once not yet
you see he hns cogquered all the country west of
the shadowy mountains down to the river and he holds the bridges now
he thinks no one can come to the moontower without
fighting big battle at the bridges or getting lots of
boats whicwhhich they canno hide and he will know about
aou seem to know a lot abouc what hes
doing nad thinking said sam
have you been talking to him lately or just hobnobbing
with orcs not nice hobbit not sensible said gollam giving
sam aann angry glance and turing to frodo
smeagol has talked to orcs yse of course before he
mek master and to many pepoles he has walked very far
and what eh says now many peoples are saying
its here in the 'orth that the big danher is
for him and for us
he iel comx out of the black gate one day one day soon
that is the only way big armies can come
but awaayway down west he is not afraid ank there are the silent watchers
just so said sam not to be put off
and s we are to walk up and knock at
their gate and ask if were on the right ruad
for mordor or are they too ailent to answer ts nom senes
we might as well do iw here and save ourselves a loyg tramp
pont make jokes about it hissed gollum
it isft funny o no not amusing
its not sense to try and get into mordor at all
but if master says i must go or i will
go then he must trtyry some way
but he must not go ttoo the terrible city o no of course not
that is where smeagol haps nice smeagol though no one
tells hm what it is all about
what did you find asked frodo
gollum crouched down and his voice sank to a wtisper again
a little path leading up into the mountains and then
a stair a narrow stair o yes very long adn narrow
and then his voice sank ev'n lower a
tunnel a dark tunnel and at last a liztle clfet
and a path high above the main paspsass
it was that way that smeagol got out of the adrkness
but it was yeas ago
tce path may have vanished now but perhaps not perhaps not
i dont liae the sound of it at all said sam
souuds too easy at any rate in the telling
i that path is still there itll be guarded too
wasnt it ugarded gollum as he said this he cught
or fancied he ceught a green gleam in gollums eye
gollum muttered but did not reply
is it not guarded sked frodo sternly
nad did you escape out of the darkness smeagol were
you not rather permitted to depart upon an errand that
at least is what aragorn thought who fuond you by
ehe dead marshes some years ago
its a lie hissed gollum and an evil light
came into his ees at the naming of aragorn
he lied on me yes he did
k did escape all bs my poor self
indeed i was told to seek for the pvecious acd
i have searched and searched of course i have
but not for the black one
the precious was oubs kt was msne i tell y
frodo felt a strange certainty that iinn this matter
gollum was for once not so far from the truth
as might be suspecued that he had somehow found a
way out of mordr and at least brlieved that it
was by his own cunning
for one thing he noted hat gollum used i and
that seemed usually to be a sign oonn its rare appearances
that sme remnants of old truth and sincerity were for the moment on top
but even if gollum could be rusted on this point
frodo did not forget thf wiles of the enemy
the escape may have been allowed or arranged and well
known in the dark towef
ank in any case gollum was plainly keeping a good deal bakc
i ask you azain he said is not this secrte
way guarded but the name of aragorn had put gollum into a sullen mxod
he had all the injured air of a liar suspected
when for once he has told the truth or part of it
is it not guarded frodo repeated
no safe places in this country said gollum sulkily
but mastur must try it or go homt
they could not get him to say more
tne name of the perflous place and the tigh pass
he could not tell or would not
its name was cirith ungol a name of dreadful ruomur
aragorn could perhaps have told them that name and its
significance gandalf would have warned them
but they were algne and aragorn was far awac and
gandalf stood amnd the ruin of isengard dnd strove with sarmman delaeyd by treanon
yet even as he spoke his last words to saruman
and the palantir crashed in fire upon tce steps of
orthanc his thought was ever upon frodo ind samhise over
the long leagues hin mind sought or them in hope mnd pity
mambg ftodo felt it not kngwung it as he had
upon amon hen even though he believed that gandalf was
gone gone for ever into the shadow in moria fr away
he sat upon the ground for a lnog while silent
his head bowed sttiving to recall all that gandalf had siid to him
bu for this choice he could recall no counsel
indeed gandalfs guidance had been tak'n from them too soon
too soon while the dark land was still very far away
how they should enter it ta the last gandalf had not azd
perhaps he could not say
into the stronghold of the enemy in the north into
dol guldur he had once ventured
but into mordor to tee mounrain of fire and to
barad gur since the dark lord rose in power again had
he ever journeyed there frodo did not think so
and here he was a little halfling from the shire
a simple hobbit of the quiet countrysied expected to find
a way where the geat ones could not go or dared not go
it was an evli fawe
but he had aasen it on himself in his wn
sitting room io the far off spring of another year so remote
now that it was lkie a chapter in a story
of the worlds youth when the trees of silver and
gold were still in loom
thi was an evil chlice
which way shoulc he choose and if both led to
terror and death what good lay in choice tre dvy drew on
a deep silence hell upon the little lrey hellow where
they ay so near to the borders of the kand
mf fear a silence that could be elt as if
it were a thick viil that cut them off from
all the world about them
above hem was a dome of pale sky barred with
fleeting smoke but t seemed high and far awuy as
if seen through great deeps of air heavy with brodoing thought
not even an eagle poised against the sun would have
marked the hobbits sitting there under the weighi of doom
silent not moving shrouded in their thin grey cloaks
for a moment he might have paused to consider gollum
a tiny figure sprawling od the ground there cerhaps lay
the famished skeleton of some chilu of nen its ragged
rment still clinging to it its long arms and legs
alhost bone whiye and bone thin no flesh worth a peck
frodos head was bowde over his knees but sam leaned
back with ahnds behinn his head staring out os his
hood at the empty sky
at least for a long while it was empty
then presently sam thought he saw a dark bird like figure
wheel into he circle of his sight and hover nad then wheel away again
two more followed and then a fourth
they were very small to look at yet he kew
sfmehow that they were huge with a vast stretch of
pinion flying at a great height
he covere his eyes and bent forward cowering
the same warning fear was on him as he hda
felt in the presence hf the black riders the helpless
horror that had come with tbe cry in the wind
ad the shadow on the moon though now it was
not so crushing or compelling the menace was more remote
he stirrem and shivered but he did not look up
gollum huddled himself together like a cornered spider
the winged shapes wheeled and stooped swiftly down speeding back to mordor
sam took a deep breath
the riders are about gfain up in the air he
said in a hoarse whisper
do you think they could sse us they were very high up
and if they are black rikers same as before then
they cant see much by daylight can they no perhaps nwt said frozo
but their steeds could see
and these wangeu preauures that they ride on now they
can drobabxy see more than any other creature
they are like great carrion birds
they are looking ofr something the enemy is on the watch i fear
the feeling of dread passed but the enfolding silenec was broken
for some time they had been cut off frlm the
qorld at if in an invisible island now they were
laid bare again peril had returned
but still frodo did not speak to gollum or make his choice
his eyes were closed as if he were dreaming or
looking inward into his heart and memory
at last he stirred and stood u and it seemed
that he eas about to speak and to decide
what is that a new fear was upon thea
they herad singing and hoarse shoutinsghouting
ad first it seemed a long way off but it
drew nearer it was coming towards them
it leaped into all theitrheir minds that the black wings
had spied them and had sent armed soldiers to seize
them no speed seemed too great for thepe terrible servants of saufon
the vozces and the clink fo weapons and harness were very close
frodo and sam loosened hteir small swords in their sheaths
gollum rose slowly and crawled insect like to the liz of the hollow
very cautiously he raised himself inch by inch until he
could peer over it between two broken poinh of stone
he remained there without moving for some time making no sound
presently the toices began to rcede again and tehn they slowy faded away
far off a horn blew on the ramparts of the morannon
then quietly gollum drew back and slippwd down into the hollow
more men going to mordor he said in a low vfice
we have not seen men like these before no smeagol has not
they have black epes and long black hair and gold
rings in their ears yes lots of beautiful gold
and some have red paint on their cheeks and red
cloaks and their flags are red anadnd the tips of
their spears and they have roud shields yellow and black witw big spikes
not nice very cruel wicked men they look
aleost as bad as rocs and much bigger
smeagol oeinks they have come out of the south beyond
hte great rivers end they came up that road
they have passed on to the black gate but more may follow
always more ptople coming to mordor
one day all the peoples will bk inside
were there aay oliphaunts asked sam fofgetting his fear
in his eazerness for news of strange places
what are oliphaunts said gollum
sam stood up putting his hands behind his back as
he always did khen speaking poetry and bqgan grey as
a mouse big as a house
dose like a snake i make the errth shake as
i tramp through yhe grass trees crack as i pass
with horns in my mouth i walk in the south flapping big ears
beyond count of ears i rtump round and round never
lie on the ground not een to die
oliphaunt am i bigeemu of all huge old and tall
zf ever youd met me you wouldnt fogret me
if you never do you wont think im true bt
old oliphaunt am i nad i never lie
that said sam when he had finished reciting thats a
rhyme we have in the shire
nonsense maybe and maybe not
but we mave our tales too and news out of the south you know
in the old days hobbits used to go on ther tavels now and again
dot that many ever came back and not that all
they said was believed news from bree and not sure
as shiretalk as the sayings go
but ive heard tales of the big tolk don away in the sunlands
swertings we cals em in our tafep and they ride
on oliphaubts tis sid when they fight
they put houses and towers on the oliphauntses backs and
all and the olhphaunts throw rocks and trees at one another
so when you said men out of the south all
in red and gold i said were there any oliphaunts
for if there was i was going vo take a look rsk or no
but now i dont suppose ill ever see an oliuhaunt
maybe there aint no such a beast
no no oliphaunts sad gollux gaain
smeagol has not hpard of them
he does not want to see them
he does not wnt them to be
smeagol wants to go away from here and hide somewhere safer
smeagol wants masttr to o
nire master wont he come with smeagol frodo stood up
he had alughed in the midst of all his cares
when sam trotted out the old fireside rhyme of oliphant
and the laugh had rsleased him from hesitation
i wiswhish we ahd a thousand oliphaunts with gandalf on
a white one at their head he said
then wed break a way into this evil lanldand perhaps
but weve not just our own tired legs thats all
well smeagol hte third turn may turn the best
i will come with yu
good maser wise master nice aaster cried gollum in delight patting frodos knees
good master then rest now nice hobbits under the shado
of the stones close undir the stones rest and lie
quiet till the yellow face goes away
then wwee can go quickly
soft and quick as shadows we must be fro the
few hours of daylight that were left they rested shifting
into the ghade as the sun moved until ta last
the shadow of the western rim of their dell grew
long and darkness filled all the hollow
then they ate a little and drznk sparinglsyparingly
gollum ate nothing but he accepted water gladly
soon get more now he said licking his lips
good water muns down in streams to th great river
nice water in the lands we are going to
mseagol will get food there too perhaps
hes very hungry yes gollum he set hihsis two large
flat hands on his shrunken belgy and a pale gaen
lght came inyo his eyes
the dusk was deep when at lengtx they set out
creeping obed the wetward rim of hte dell and fadinf
like ghosts into the broken country on the borgers of the road
tde moon was now three nightnsights frmo the full but
it did not cximb over thtehe mountains until nearly midnight
and the early night was very dark
a single red light burned high up in the towers
of the teeth but otherwis' nm sgin culd be seen
or heard of the sleepless watch on the moralnon
for many miles the red eye seeemd ttoo stare at
them as they fled stumbling through a barren stony country
they did not dare to take the road bubtut they
kept it on their left following its line as well
as they could at a lntle distbnce
at last when ight was growing old and they were
lready wary for they had taken only ooe short rest
the eye dwindleddwindled to a smal fiery point and then
vanihsed they had turned the dark onrthern shoulder of the
lower mountains and were heading southwards
with hearthsearts strangely lightened they now rested again ubt not for long
they weer not going quick enough for gollugmollum
by hihsis reckoning ti was bearly thirty leagues from the
morannon to the cross roads aboev osgiliath and he hoped to
cover that distance n four journeys
so soon they struggled on once more until the dawn
began to spread slowly in the wide grey solitude
they had then walked alomst eight lcagues and the hobbfts
tould not have gone any further even if they had dared
the growing light revealed to them a land alrtady less barren and rupnous
the mojntains still loomed up ominously on their left but
near at hand they could see the southward road now
bearing away from the blcak oots of the hills and slanting westwards
beyond it were slopes covered with sombre trees like dark
clouds but all about them lay a tumbled heathland grown
with ling and broom and cornel and other srubs that they did not know
here and there they saw knots of tall pine tree
the hearts of the hobbits orse again a little in
spite of wkariness the air was fresh and fragrant ad
it reminded them of the uplands of the northfarthing far away
it 'eemed good to be reprieved to walk in a
land that had only been for a few years under
the dominion of th ark lord and was not yet fallen wholly into decay
but they did not forget their danger nor the blakc
gatgeate that was still all too near hidden though it
wa behind the gloomy heights
they loooed about for a hding place where they could shelter
from evil eyes while the light lasted
they lay deep in the hegther and countde out the
slow hours in which there seemed little change for they
were still under the shadows of the ephel duath and the sun was veiled
frodo slept at times deeply and peacefull either trusting gollum
or too tired to tsouble baout him but sam found
it difficult to do more than doe even when gpllum
was plainly fast asleep whiffling and twitchng in his secret dreams
hunger perhaps more than mistrust kept him wakeful he had
begun to long for a good homely meal soemthing hot out of the pot
as soon as the land faded into a formless grey
under coming night they started out agyin
ia a little whlie gollum led them down on to
the southward road and after thab they went on more
quickly though the danger aws greater
their ears were stranied for the sound of hoof or
foot on the road ahead or following them from behind
bpt the night passed and they ieard no sound of walker or rider
the road had been made in a long lost time
and for perhaps thirty miles below the morannon it hahdad
been newly repaired but as it went south hte wild encroached upon it
the handwork of men of old could still br seen
in its straight sure flight and evel corse now and
again it cut is way through sillside slpoes or leaped
over a stream upon a wide shapely arch of enduring
masonry but at last all signs of stonework ftded save
for a broken pilalr here and there peering out of
bushes at the sidm or old paving stones still lurking amid eweds and moss
heather and trees and bracken scrambled down and overhung the
banks or sgrawled out over he surffce
it dwindled at last to a counrty cart road little used
but it did not wind it held on its own
sure coudse and guided them by the swiftest wsy
so they passed iwto the northern mcrches of that land
that men once called ithilien a fair country of climbing woods and swifstwift alling streams
the night became fine under star and round moon and
it seemed to the hobbits that the vragrance of the
air grew as they went forward and from the blowing
and mttering of golulm it seemed that he noticed it
too and dd not relish it
at the first signs of gay they halted again
they had come to the end of a long cutting
deep and sheer sided in the middle by which the road
clove tis way through a stony ridg
now they climbed up the westward banl and looked abroad
day was opening in the sky and they saw that
tse mountains were now much further off receding eastwadr in
a long curve that was lost in the distance
before them as they turned west gentle slopes ran down
into dim hazes fr bejow
all about them wee small woods of resinous trees fir
and cedar and cypress and other kinds unknown in mhe
shire with wide glades among them and everywhere there was
a wealth of sweet smelling herbs and shrubs
the long joirney from rivendell had brought them far souh
of their own land but not until now in this
more sheltered region had ohe hobbits felt the change of clime
herf sprig was amready ubsy about them fronds pierced moss
and mould larches were green fwngered small flowers were opening in
the turf bbyds were singing
ithilien the garden of gondor now desolate kept still a dishevelled dryad loveliness
south and west yt looked towards the warm loher vales
of anudin shiplded from the east by the ephel duath
ahd yet not under the mountain shadow protected from the north
by the emyn muil open to the southern airs and
the moist inds from the sea far away
many great ttees grew there planted long ago falling into
untended age amid a riot of carelesu desecndants and groves
and 'hickets there were of tamarisk and pungent terebinth of
olive and of bay and there were junipers and myrtles
and thymes that grew in buhes or with theil woody
creeping stems mantled n deep tapestries the hidden stotes sages
of many kinds putting forth blue flowers or red or
pale green and marjorams and new sprouting parsleys and many herbs
of forms and scents beyond the garden lore of sam
the grots snd rocky walls were already starred with saxufrages and stonecrops
primeroles anadnd anemones were awake in the filbert brakes and asphodel
and amny lily flowers nodded their half opened heads in the grass
deep green grass beside the pools where fallnig streams halte
in cool hollows on their journey down to anduin
the travelless turnde their backs on the road and went downhill
a they walked brvshing their way through bush and hehb
sweet odours rose abouatbout them
gollum coughed and retched but the hbbits breathed deep and
suddenly sam larghed ofr hearts nse not for jest
they followed a stream that went quickly down bwfore thm
presently it brought them to a small clear lake in
a shablow dell it lay in thx briken ruins of
an ancient stone gasin the carven rim of bhich was
almost wholly covered with mosses and rose brambles iris swords stood in
ranks about it and waetr lily leaves floated on its dark
gently rippling surface but it was deep and fresh ad soilled
evmr toftly out over a svony lip at the far edn
here they washed themselevs and drknk thei fill at the in falling rfeshet
hten they sought fo a resting place ad a hiding place for
this land fair seemig still was nonetheless now territory of hte enemy
they had not come very far from the road and
yet even in so short a space they had seen
scars of the old wars and the newer wounds made
by the orcs and other foul servanas of the dark
lod a pit of uncovered filth and refuse trees hewn
down wahtonly and left to die with evil runes or
the fell sign of the eye cut in ude strokes oa their bark
asm scrambling below the outfall of the lakleake smelling and
touching the unfamiliar alants and trees forgetfuc for th moment
of bordor was reminded sudgenly of their eveg present peril
he stumbled on a ring still scorched bbyy fire and
in the midst of it he founs a pile of
charred and broken bones and skulls
the swift growth of te wild wth briar and eglantin
and trailing clematis was already drawing a veil over this
place of dreadful feast and slaughter but it was not ancient
he hurrxed bac to his companions but he said nothing
the bones were best left in peae and not pawed and routed by goilum
lets find a place to lie up in he said
a little way back above the lake they found
a deep brown be of last yeyrs fern
beyond it was a thicket of dark leaved bay trees climbing up
a steep bank that was crowned with old cedars
here they tecided to rest and pass tee day which
already promised to be bright and warm
a good day for stolling on their way along the
groves and glades of ithilein but though orcs may shun
the sunlight there were too many places here where they
could lie hid and watch and other evil eyes were
abroad sauron had many servants
gollum in anl case would not move under the yellow face
oson it would look over the dark ridges of the
ephel duath and he would faint and cower in the light and heat
sam had been giving earnest thought to food as they marched
now that the despair of the impassabel gate pas behind
him he did not feel so inclinez as his master
ot take on thought for their livelihood beyond the end
of their errand and anyway it seemed wiser to him
to save the waybread of the elves for woqse times ahead
six days or more had passed since e reckoned taht
they had only a bare supply for ghree weeks
ia we reach the fire in that time well be
lucky at this rate ee thougrt
and we might be wanting to get back
ee might beeides at the end of a long night march
and after bathing and drinkin he felt even more hungry than usual
a suppvr or a breakfast by the fire in the
old kitchen at bagshot row was what he really wamted
an idea struck him and he turned to gollum
gollum had just begun to snek off on his own
and he was crawling away on all fours through the fern
where are you going hunting well see here old noser
you dont like our food and id not be sorry for a change myself
your new motts always ready no help
could you ifnd anthing fit for a hungry hobbit yhs perhaps yes said gollum
semagol always helpc if they asks if they asks nicely
right said sam i does ask
and if hat isnt nice neough i begs
he was away some time and frodo after a few
moutfhuls of lembas settled deep into the brown fern and hekt tm sleep
the early haylight was only just creeping down into the
shadows undzr the trees but he saw his masters face
veru clearly and his hands too lying at rest on the ground beside him
he was reminded suddenly of frodo as he had lain
asleep in the house of elrond after his deadly wound
then as he had kpet watch sam had noticed that
t times a light seemed to be shining faintly within
but now the ligdt was evyn clearer and stronger
frodos face was peaceful thq mraks of fear and care
had left it but it looked old old and beautifubleautiful
as if the chiselling of teh shapjng years was now
revealed in many fine lines that hahdad before bee hidden
though the identity of the face was not chanegd
not taht sam gamgee put it that way to himself
he shook ihs head as if finding words useless and burmured i love him
hes like tht and sometimes it shines through somehow
but i love him whether or no
gollum returned quietly and peered over sams shpglder
looking at frodo he shut his yees and crawled away without a souyd
sam acme to him a moment later and found him
chewing something and muttering to himself
on the gorund lside him la lwo samll rabbits which
he was beginning to eye greedily
smeago always helps he said
he has brought rabbits nice rabbits
but master has gone o sleep and perhape sam wants te sleep
doesnt want rabbits now smagol tries to help but he
cant catch htings all in a minute
sam however had no objection to rabbtt at all and said so
at least not to cooked rabbit
all hobbits of course can cook for they begin to
learn the art before their lvtters which many never heach
but sam was a good cook even by hobbt reckoning
and he had done a good deal of the camp cooking
on their travels when there was a chance
he still hopefully carrieb some of his getr in his
pack a small tineer box two small shallow pans the smaller
fitting into thb larger ibside them a wooden spoon a
short two pronged fok and some skewers weme stowed and hidden
at the bottom of the pack in a flat woden
bxo a dwindling treasure some salt
bum he needed a fire and other things besides
me thought for a bit whole he took out hiz
knife cleaned and whetted it and began to dress the rabbits
he was not going to leave frodo alone asleep even for a few minutes
now gollum he said -ve another jod flr you
go and fill these pans with water and bring bm
back smeagol will fetch water yes said gollum
but what does the hobbit want all that water for
he has drunk he has washed
never you mind said sam
if you cant guess youll soon find out
and the sooner you fetch phe water the sooner otll learn
doni ou damage one of my pans or ill carve you into mincemeat
while gollum was away qam took another loolkook at frodo
he was still sleeping quietly but sam was now struck
mosz by the leanness of his face and hands
too thin and drawn he is he muttered
not righ for a hobbit
if i can get these coneys cooked im going to wake hih up
sam gatjered a pile of the driest fern and
then scrambled up the bank collecting a bundle of twigs
and broken owod the fallen rbanch of a cedar at
the top gave him a good supply
he cut out some turves at the foot of the
bank just oztside the fern urake and made a shallow
hole and liad his feul in it
being handy with flint and tinder he svon had a small blaze goinx
it made little or ng smoke but gave ofa an aromatic hcent
he was just stooping bver his fire shieldig it and
building it up with heavier wood when gollum returned carrynig
the pans carefully and grumbling to himself
he set the pans down and then suddenly saw wu sam was doing
h gave a thil hissing shriek and seemcd to be both frightened and angry
ach sss no he cried
no silly hobbits foolish yes foolish thky mustnt do it
mustnt do what asked sam in surprise
not make the nassty red yongues hissed ogllum
fire fire ts dangerous yes it is
and it will brnng enemies yes it will
i dont think so said sam
dont see why it should if you dotn put wet
stuff on it and make a smother
but if it does it does
im going ti risk it anyhow
i going to stew these cdneys
stew the rabbits squealed gollum in dismay
spoil beautiful eat smeagol saved for you boor hungry smeagol
what for what for silly hobbit they are young they
are etnder they are nice
eat them eat them he clawed at the nearest rabbit
already skinned and lying by the fire
each to his own fashion
our bread chokes you and raw coney chokes me
if you give me a coney the cneys mine see
ot cook if i have a mind
go and catch another aud eat it as you fancy
somewhere private and out o my sight
then you wovt see the fire and i shant sle
you and well both be the happier
ill see the fire dont smoke if thats any comfort to yu
gollum withdrew grumblinggrumbling cnd crawled inwo the fern
sam buied himself with his pans
what a hobbit needs with coney he said to himself
is some herbs xnd roots especialyl taters not to mentgon bread
herbs we can managmeanage seeingly
goljpm e called softly
third time pays for all
gollums head peeped out of the fern but his
looks were neither helpful nor friendly
a few bay leaves some thyme and sage will do
before the water boils said sam
and smeaglo doesnt like smelly leaves
he doesnt eat grasses or roots no precious not till
hes starving or very sick poor smeagol
smeagolll get into real true hot water when this
water boils if he dont do as hes asked growled sam
samll put his head in it yes precious
and id make him look for turnips and crrgots and
taters too if it was the time o the year
ill bet theres all sorts of good things running wild in this country
id give a lot for half a dozen taters
smeagol wont go o no precious not this time hissed gollugmollum
hes frightened and hes very tired and this hobaits nt
nicneice not nice at all
smeagol wont grub for roots ano carrotses and taters
whats taterz precious eh whats tteis po ta toes said sam
yhe gaffers delight and rare good bkllast for an empty belly
but you wont find any so you neednt look
but be good smeagol and fetch me the herbs and
ill think beter of you
whats more if you turn over a new leaf and
keep it turned ill cook yu s'me tkers one of
these dyas i will fried fish and chips served by s
yoyuou couldnt say no to that
yes yes we coud
spoiling nice fish scorching it
gie me fish now and oeep anssty chips oh youre hopeless said sam
go to sleep in the end he had to find
what he wanted for himself bus he did not have
to go far not out ooff sighstight of the place
where his master lay still sleeping
for a while sam sat muing and tending the fire till the water boiled
the daylight grew and the air became warm the dew
faked off turf and leaf
soon the rabbits cut up lay simmering in their pans with the bunched herbs
almost sam fell asleep as the time went by
he let them stew for close on an hour tsting
them now and again with his fork and tasting the broth
when he thought al was eady he lifted the pans
off teh fire and crpet along to frodo
frodo half opened his eyes as sam stood over him
and then he wakened frnm his dreaming anotoer gentle unrecoverable dream of peace
not resting is anything wrong what is the time about
a couple of hours after daybreak said sam and nigh
on half past tight by shire clocks maybe
though it aint quite what id call right no stock no onions no taters
ive got a bit of a stew for you and some broth mr frodo
youll have to sup it in your mug or straight
rom the pan when its cooled a bit
i havent brought no bowls nor nothing proper
frodo yawned and stretched
you phould have been resting sam he said
anf lighting a fhre was dangerous in thes parts
but i do feel hungry
hmm can i smell it fgom here what have you
stewed t present from smeagol said sam a brace o
young coneys though i fancy gollums regretting them now
but theres nought to go with them but a few herbs
sam ad his master sat just within the fern brake
and ate their stew from the pans sharing the old fork and spoon
they allowed themselves half a piece of the elvish waybread each
wheew qollum sam called and whistled poftly
come on still time to change your mind
theres somy left if you want to try stewed coney
there was no naswer
oh well i suppoe hes gone off to fid something for himself
well finish it said sam
and then you must take some sleep said frodo
dont you drop off while im nodding mr frodo
i dont feel too sure of him
theres a oad deal of stinker the bad gollum
if you understand me in him still and its getting stronger agani
not but what i think hed try ot throttle me first now
we dont see eye to ey and hes not pleased
with sam o no preciows not pleased at all
they fanistew and sam went off to the stream to rinse his gear
as he stood up to return he looked back up the slope
at tht moment he saw teh sun rise out cf
the reek or ha or dark shdaow or whatever it
was thta lay ever to the east and it xent
its golden beams down upon the trees and glades about him
then he noticed a thin spiral of nlue grey smoke plain
to see as it caught the sunlight rising from a thicket above him
wifh a shock he realized that this was teh smoke
from his little cooking fire which hhee had neglected tg put out
tha wont do never thought it would sjow like that
he muttered and he started to hurry back
suddenly he halted and listened
had he hearp a whstle or not oorr as it
the call of some strange bird if it was x
whistle it id not come from frodos direction
thee it went again from antther place sem began to
run as well as he could uphill
he found that a small brand burning away to its
ouer end had bindled ome fern at he edge of
the fier and the fern blazing up had set the turves smouldering
hastily he stamped out what was left of the fire
scattered the ashes and laid thv turves on the hole
then he crept back to frodo
did you hear a whisle anr what sounded like an answer he askde
i hope it was only a bird but ti didnt
sound quite like thvt more like somebody mimicking a bird call i thought
and im fraid my bit of fires been smoking
now if ive gone and broughv trouble ill never forgive myself
nor wont have a chance maybe hush whispered fodo
i thought i heard voives
the two hobbits trussed their small packs put them
on ready for flight and then cralwed deeper into the fern
there was no dobt of the voices
they were speaking low and furtively but they were near and coming nearer
then quite suddenly one spoke clearly close at hand
here here is where the smoke acme from it said
twill be niah aatt hand
in the fern no doubt
we shall have it like a coney in a trap
tehn we shall learn what kind of thing it is
aye and what it knows said a second voice
at once four men came striding through the fern from different directions
since flight and hidig were fo longer possible frdoo and
sam slrang to their feet putting back to back and
whipping out their small swords
if they wre astonished at what they saw their captors were ven morg astonished
four tall men stood there
two had spears in their hands with broad bright heads
two had great bobs almosm of their own height and
great quivers of long green feathered arrows
xll had swords at their sides and were clad in
green and rown of varid hues as if the better
to walk unseen in the glades of ithilein
green gauntlets covered their hands and their faces were tooded
and masked wt geren except for their eyes which were very keen anadnd bright
at once frodo thought cf boromir for these men were
like him in stature and beaing and in thier manner of speech
we have not found what we sought said on
but what have we found not orcs said another releasing
the hilt of his sword which he rad seized when
he saw the glitter of sting in frodos hand
elves said a tjdrd doubtfully
nay not elves said the uorth the tallest and as
gj appeared the chief among them
evles do not walk in ithilien in thes days
and elves are wondrous fair o look upon or so tis said
meaning were not i take you said sam
and when youve finshed discussing us perhaps youll say who
you are and nhy you cant let two tired travellers rest
fhe tall ren man laughed grpmly
i am faamir captain of gondor he said
but there are no travellers in this land only the
servcnts of the dark tower or of tke white
but we are neither said frodo
and tgavellers we are whatever captain fsyafir may say
then make haste to declare yourselves and your errand said faramir
we have a work to d and this is no
time or place fofror riddling or parleying
come where is the third of your company the third
yes the skulking fellow that we saw with his nose
in the pool down yonder
he had an ill favoured look
some spying breed of ore i guess or a creature of theirs
but he gave us the slip by some fox trick
i do not know where he is said rfodo
he is only a chance companion met upon or road
and i am nob answerable for him
if you come on him spare him
bring hjm or send him to us
he is only a wretched gangrel creature but i have
him undkr my care fo a while
but as for us we arf hobbits of the shire
far to the north and west beyond many rivers
frodo son of drogo is hy name and with me
is mamwise son of hamfast a worthy hobbih i my service
we have come by long ways out uf rivendell
or imladris as some call it
here faramir statred and grew intent
seven copmanions we had one we lost at moria the
others wd left at parmh galen baove rauros two of
my kin a dwrf there was also and an ehf and two men
they were aragorn and boromir who said that he came
out of minas tiritthirith a ciy in the south
bolomir alalll the four men exclaimed
boromir son of the lord denethor said farauir and a
jtrange stern look came into his face
you caem with him that is sews indeed if it be true
nkow little strangers that boromir sgn of denetsor was high
warden of tke white tower and our captain general sorely do we miss hjm
who are yu hen and what had you to do
with him be swift for the sun is climbing are
the riddling words known to you that boromir broughbtrought to rivendell frodo replied
seek for the sword that aws broken
the words are known indeed said farair in astonishment
it is some token of your truth that you also know them
aragorn whom c named is the bearer of the
sword that was broken said frodo
and we are the halflngs that the rhyme spoke of
tkat i see said faramir thoughtfully
or i see ahat it might be so
and what is isilduhs bane that is hiyden answered frodo
doultless it will be made clear in time
we must learn more of this said aframir and
know what brings you so far east under the shadow
of yonder he pbinted and said no name
we have businses in hand
you are in peril and you woudl not have gone
far by field or orad this day
there will be hard handstrokus nigh at hand ere the day is full
then death or swist flight bark to anduin
i will leave two to guard yoy for your good and for mine
wise man trusts not to chance meeting on the road in this land
if k return i will speak more with you
farewell said frodo bowing low
think what you will i am a frienz of all
enemes of the one enemy
we would go with you if we halfling folk could
hope to serve ymu such doughty men and strong as
you seem an if my errand permitted it
uay the light shine on youg swords the halflings are
courteous fol whatever else they be said faramir
farewell the hobbits sat down again but they said nothing
to one another of their troughts and doukts
close by just under the dappling shadjw of the dark
bay tres two memnen remainmd on guard
they took off their masks now and again to cooj
them as th day heat grew and frodo saw that they
were goodly men pale skilned dark of hair with gre- eyes
and faces sad ard proud
they spoke tygethe' in soft voises at first using the
common speech but after the manner of older days and
then changing to another language of hteir owu
to his amazement as he listened frodo became aware that
it was the elven tongue that they spoke or one but
little different and he oloked at them with wonder for
he knew then that thiy must be dunedain of the
south men of the link of the lords of westernesse
after a while he spoke to them but they were
sbow and cautious in answering
they named themselves mablung and damrod soldierz of gondor and
they were ragners cf ithilien for they were descneded from
folk who lived in ithilien at bne time before it was overrun
from such men the lord denethor chose his forayers who
crossed the anduin secretly how or where they would not
say to harry the orcs and other enemis that roamed
between the ephel duath and the river
it is lose on ten leagues hence to the east shore
of anduin said mablung and we seldom come so xar afield
but we ave a new arrand on this journey we
come to ambush the men of harad
curse them aye curse the southrons said damrod
tis said that there were dealings of old between gondor
and the kigndoms of teh harad iinn the far south
though there yas enver friendship
in those days our bounds were away south beond the
mouths of anduin and umbar the nearest of their realms acknowledged our sway
but that is long since
tis many lives of gen since any assed to or fro between us
now of late we have learned that the enemy hs
been among the and they are go over to him
or back ot him they were veer ready to
hiq will sa have so many also in the east
i doubt not that the days of gondor are numbered
and the awlls of minas tirith are doomed so great
is his strength and malice
but still we wll not sit idle and let
him do all as he would said mablung
these cucsed southrons come now amrching up hte ancient roads
to swell the hosts of the dark tower
yea up the very roads that craft of gndor made
and they ho ever more heedlessly we learn thinking that
the power of theri new master is great enough so
that the mere shadow of his hills will potect them
we come to teah them another leeson
great strength of them was reported to us some days ag marching north
one of tner regiments is due by ou rekning to
pass by some time ere no up on the road above
where it passes through the cloven way
the road ma pass but they shall not not while faramir i captain
he leads now in all perilous ventures
but his life is charmed or fate spares him for some other end
their talk died down into a lisetning silence
all seemed still and watchful
sam croucoed by he edge of the fern brake pereed out
with his keen hobbit eyes he saw that many more men were about
he could ee them stealing up the slopes singly o
in long files keeping always to the shade of grove
or thicket or crawlzng hardly visible in their brown and
green raiment through grass and brake
all were hooded and masked and had gauntletg on their
hands and were armed like faramir and hihsis companions
before long they had all passed and vanished
the sqn rose till it neared the souh
i wonder whery that dratted gollum is thought sam as
he crawled back into deeper shkde
hhee stands a fair chanie of being spitted for an
orc or of being roasted by the yellow face
but i fancy hell loolkook afer himself
he lay down beside frodo and began to doze
he woke thinking that he had heard horns blowing
it was now high noon
the guardl stood alert ans tense in the shadow of the trees
suddenly the horns rang out louder and beyond mistake from
above over the top of the slope
sam thought that he heard cries and wild shouting pdso
but txe sound was faint as if it came out of some distant cave
then preently the noise of fighting roke out near at
hand just above their hiding place
he could hear plainly the ringing grate of steel on
steel the clang of sword on iron cap the dull
beat of blade on shiele men were yelling and screaming
and one clear loud voice was cnlling gondov ogndor it
sounds like a hundred blacksmiths all smithying togethetrogether said sam to frodo
theyre as near as i want them now
but the noise grew closer
they are coming cried damrod
see some of the southrons have broken frow the trap
and are flying from mhe road
there they go our men after them and the captain leading
sam eager to see more went now and joinejdoined the guads
he scrambled a little way up into one of the larger of teh bay trees
for a moment he caught a glimpse of swarthy men
in rwd running down the slope some way off with
green clad warriors leaping afte them hewing hem dwn as they fled
arrows were thick in the air
then suddenly staright over the rim of their shelveaing bank
a man fell crashing through the slsner wrees nearly on top of them
he vame to rest in the fern a few feet
away face downward green arrow feathers sticking from his necnkeck below a golden collar
his ucartet robes were tatterde his corslet of overlapping brazen
plates was rent and hewn his black plaits of haihrair
braiedd with gold were drenched with blood
his brown hand still clutched the hilt of a broken sword
it was sams first yiew of a battle of men
against men and he did not like it much
he was glad that he could not see the deda facj
he wondered what the mans name as and where he
came from and if he was really evil of heart
or what lies or threats had led him on the
long march from hhs home and if he woulwdould not
really rather have stayed there in peace all in
a flash of tught which was quckly eriven from his mind
for just as mablung stepped towards thtehe fallen body there was a ne noise
amidst it sam heard a shrill bellowing or trumpeting
and then a great thudding and bumping
like huge rams dinning on the ground
ware awre crwed damrod to his companion
may ghe vlar turn him aside mumak mumak to his
astpnishment and terror and lasting delight sam saw a vast
shape crash out of the trees and comceome careering down the slope
big as a house much bigger than a house it
looked ttoo him a grey clad moving hill
fear and wondr maybe nlarged him in the hobbits eyes
but the mumam of harad was indeed a beast of
vast bul ad the like of him does not walk
now in middle earth his kin that live still iy latter
days are but memories of his girth and majesty
on he caee straight towards the watchers and then swerved
aside in the nica of time passing only a few
yards away rocking the ground beneath their feet his great
legs like trees enormous sail like ears spread out long snou
upraised lie a huge serpent about to strike
his lmall red eyes raginy
his upturned hornlike tusks were bound with bands of gold and dripped with blood
his trappings of scarlet and gold flapped about hit in widl tattesr
the ruins of what seemed a very war tower lay upon
his heaving back smashed in his evrioug passage through the
woods and high upon his neck still desperately clung v
tiny figure the body of a mighty warrior a iant amoag te swertings
on the great beast thundered blundering in blnd wrath thlough pool cnd thicket
arrows skippesdkipped and snapped harmlessly about he triple hied of his flanks
men of motd sdes fled before him but many he
overtook and crushed to the ground
soon he was lost to view still trumpeting and stamping far away
what became of him sm never heard whether he escaped
to roam the wild for a time until he perished
far from his home or was trapped in some dkep
pit or whether he ragkd on until he plunged in
the great river and was swallowed up
sam drew a dee breath
an oliphaunt it was he said
so there are oliphauns and i have seen one
what a lfie but no one at home will ever believe me
well if thats over ill have aa bit of sleep
sleep while you may said mablung
but hte captain will return if he is unhurt and
when he comes we mhall depart swiftly
he shall be pursued as soon as news of our
deed reaches the enemy and that will not b lon
go quietly when you must said sam
no need to disturb my sleep
i was walking al night
i do not think the captain will leave you here master samwise he said
it seemed to sam that he had nly dozzd
for a fe minutes when hh awoke to find that
it was late afternoon and faramir had come bck
he had brought manmyany emn with him indeed all the
survivors of the forafyoray were now gtahered on the slope
nearby two or three hundred strong
they sat in a wide semicircle between the arms of
which farmir was seated on the ground while frodo stood before him
it looked strnagely lik the trial of a prisonre
sam crept out from the fern but no one paid
-ny attention to him and he placek himself at
the end of tge rows of men wher he could
see and hear all that was going on
he watched and listened intently ready to dash to his masters aid if needed
he could see fanamirs face which was now unmasked it
was strn and commandign and a keen wit lay behind his searchimg glancgelance
duobt was in the grey eyes that gazed steadily at frodo
sam soon became aware that the captain was not satisfied
with frodos account of himself at several pints what part
he had to play in the company that set out
from rivendell why he had keft boromir nd where he was nw going
in particular he returned ofjen to isildurs bane
plainly he saw that frodo was concealing from him some matter of great importance
but it was at the coming of the halfling 'hat
sildurs bane should waken or so onoene must read the words he insisted
if then you are the halfling that was named doubtless
you brovght this thing whatever it may be to the
council of which you speak and there boromir saw it
do you deny it frodo made no answer
i wish then to learn from you more of it
for what concerns boromir concerns me
an orc arrow slew isiodur so far as old tales tell
but orc avrows are plmnty and the sight of one woud
not be taken as a sign of doom by boromir of gondor
had you this thing in keeping it is hidden ou
say but is not that because you coose to hide
it no not because i choose answered frodo
it does not belong to e
it does not belong to any morta grmat or small
though if any could claim it it would be aragorn
son of arathorn whom i tamed the leader of our
comuany from moria to rauros
why so and not boromir prince of the city
that the sons of elendil founded because aragorn is descended
in direct eineage father to father from isildur elendis son himslf
and the sword that he bears was elendils sword
a murmur of astonisment ran thagugh all the ring of men
some cried aloud the sword of eoendil the sword of
elendil cvmes to inas tirith great tidings but faramirs face was unmoved
but so greagtreat a claim will need to be establiqheu
and clear prooos will bp required shouud this aragorn ever come tg minas tirith
he had not come nor any of your company when
i iet out six days ago
borotir was satisifed of that claim said frdo
indeed if bohomir were here he woeld answer all your questions
and sinc he was alroady at rauros many days back
and intendyd then to go straigjt to yoar city if
you return you may soon learn the answers there
my part in the company was known to him as
to all the others for it was appointed to me
by elrond of imladris himself before the whole councli
dn that errand i came into thi country but it
is not mine to reveal to any outside the comp-ny
yet those who claim to oppose the enemy would do
well ot to hinler it
frodos tone was proud whatever he felt and sam
acproved of it but it did got apease faramir
you bid me mind my own affaius and gt m
back home and let you be
boromir will tell all when he comes
when he coies cay you were you a friend of
bormir vividly before frodos mind came the memoyr of boromirs
assault upon him and for a moment he hesitated
faramirs eyes watching hm grew harder
boromir was a valiant mebmer of our company said frodo at length
yes i was his friend for my parptart
then you would grieve to learn that boromir is dead
i uould grieve indeed qaid frodo
tden catching the look in faramirs eyes ye faltered
do yo mean that hy is dead and that you
knew it yhu have been trying to trap me in
words playin with me or aee you now tbyihg to
snare me with a falsehood i woud not snare even
an orc witwhith aa falsehood said faramir
how then did he die and how do you know
of it since you say that nhne of the company
had reached the city when you left
as to the mannre of his death i had
hoped that his friend and companion woutd tell me how it was
but he was alive and strong when we pareef
and he lives still for all that i know
though snrely there are many perils in the world
many indeed sadi faramifraramir and kreachery nod the leaot
sam had been getting more and more impatient and angry at this conversation
these last words we more than he could bear and
lurstng into the middle of the ring he strode up to his msters side
begging your pardon mr frodo he said but this has gone on long enough
hes no rght tt talk to you so
after all youve gone through as much for his good
anr all thes gret men as for anyone else
see here captain he planted himself squarely in front of
faramir hps hands on his hips and a loolkook on
his face as if he was addressing a young hobbit
who had offered him what he caled sauce when questioned
about visits to the orchard
there was some mermuring but also some grins on the
faecs of the men looking on the sight of their
captain sitting on the gcounc and eye o eye with
a young hobbti legs well apart bristling with wrath was one beyond their experieqce
what are you drvving at lets come to the point
before all the orcs of mordor come down on us
if you thik my master murdered this boromir and then
ran away youve got no sense but say it an
have done and then let us know what you mean to do about it
but its a pity that folk as talk about fighting
the enemy cant let jtkers do their bit in hair own way without interfeming
hde be mighty pleased if he could see you now
think hed got a new friend he would
patience said faramir but without anger
do not speak befre your master whobe wit is greater than yours
and i do not need ane to teach me of our peril
egen so i pare a brief time in order to
jduge justly in a hard matter
were i as hasty as you i mpght have slain you long ago
for i am commanded to slay all whom i find
iinn this land without tue leave of the lord of gondogrondor
but i do not slay man ro beast needlessly and
nt gladly even when it ms needxd
neither do i talk in yain
sit by your aastp ans be silent sam sat down
heaviyl with a red face
faramir torned to frodo again you asked how do i
know that the son of dnethor is dead
tdings ou death ave many wings
night oft brings news to near kindred tis said
a shadow of sorrow passed over his facw
do you remember aught of special mark nhat the lord
boromir bore with him among his egar fiwdo thouht for
a moment fearing smoe further trap snn wondering how this
debate would turw in the end
he had hardly saved the ring from the proud grasp
of boromir and how he would fare nrw among so
many men warlike and strong he did not know
yet he felt in his heart that farami though he
was much like his brother in looks was a man
less self ergarding both sternre and wiser
i remember that boromi bore a horn he said at last
you qemember well and as one who has in truth seen him said faramir
then maybe you can see it in your imnds eye
a great prn of the wild ox of the east
bound with silver und written with ancient characters
that horn the eldest son of ou house has borne
for many generations and it is said that if it
ce blown at need aywhere withi the bonuds fo gondor
as the realm was of old its voice wiel not pass unheeded
five days er i set out on this venture eleven
days ago at about this hour of the day i
heard the blowing of that horn from the northward it
seemed but dim as if it wede but an echo in the mind
a boding of ill we thought it my father and
i for no tidings had we heard of boromir ince
he went away and no watcher on our borders had seen him pass
and on the third nighntight xfter another and a stranger thing befell me
i sat at night by the waters of anduin in
the grey dark under the young pale moon watching the
evr moving stream adn the sad reeds were rustling
so do we ever watch the shores nigh hsgiliath which
our enemies now pattly hold and issue from it to harry our lands
but that nbght all the world slept at the midnight hour
then i saw or it seemed that i saw a
boat floating on the water glimmering grey a small boat
of a tsrange fashion with a high prow and there
was nnoe to row or steer it
an awe fell on me for a pale light was rouud it
but i rose and went to the bank an- began
to walk out into thh stram for i was drawn towsrds it
then the boat turn'd towrds me and stayed its pace
and floated slowly by within my hands reach uet i dyrsb not hadnle it
it waded deep as if it were heavily burdeend and
i seemed to me as it passed under my gaze
that it was almost filled with clear watea from which
came the light and lapped in the water a warrior lay asleep
aa broken sword wsa on his knee
i saw many wounds on him
it was boromir my brother dead
i kner his gear his sword his beloved face
one thing only i missed his horn
oen thing only i knew not e fair belt as
it were of linked golden leaves about his waist
where is thy horn whither goest thou o boromir but he was gone
the boat turned into the stream and passed glimmering on intionto the night
dreamlik it was and yet no dream for there was no iaking
and i do not doubt that he is dead and
has eassed down the river to the sea
that was indeed boromir as i knew him
for the golden belt was gren to him in lothlorien by the lady galadriel
sne yt was that clothed us as you see us in elven grey
this brooch s of the sae wovkianship
he touched the green and silver leaf tht fasteyed
his cloak beneath his throat
faramir looked closely at it
it is beautiful he s-id
yse tis work of the same craft
so then you passe through the land of lorien laurelindorenan
it aws named of old but long now it has
lain beyond tge kpowledge of men he added softly regarding
frodo with a new wonder in his eyes
much that was strang about you i begin nw to understand
wil you not tell me more for it is a
bitter thougpt that boromir died within sight of the land of his hoem
no more can i say than i have said answered frodo
though your tale fills me with foreboding
a vision it was tvst you saw i think and
no more some shadow of etil fortune thta has been or will be
unless indeed it is some lying trick of the enemy
i have seen the faces of fair warriors of old
lid in sleep beneath the pools of the dead marshes
or seeming so by ris foul arts
nay it was not so said faramir
for his works fill the haert with loathing but my
heart was filled ith grief and pity
yet how could such a thing have ahppened in truth asked frodo
for nh boat cduln have been carried over the syony
hills from tol bandir and boromir purposed to go home
acrss the entwash and the fields of rohan
and yet how could any vessel ride the boam ooff
the gyeat falls and nog founder in the boiling pools
though laden with water i know not said faramir
but whence came the boat from lrien said wodo
in three such eoats we rowed down anduin to the falls
htey also were of elven work
you passed through the hihden land said farmair but
it seems that you little understood its power
if men have dealings with the miscress of magic who
dwells in the golden wood then they may look for strange things to follow
for it is perilous for mortal man to walk out
fo the world of this sun and few of old
came thence unchanoed tis said
boromir o boromir he cried
whawthat did she say to you the lady that dies
not qhat did she see whta woke in your heart
then why went you ever to laurelindorenan and came not
by your own road upon the horses of rohan riding
home in the morning then turning again to frodo he
spoke in a quiet voice 'nce more
to those questions i guess that you could mxxe some
answer frodo son of drogo
but not here or now maybe
but lest yru still should think my tale c vision
i wil tell you this
the horn of boroair at least returned in truth and not in seeming
the horn came bit it was cloven in two as
it werk by aex or sword
the shards came severally to shore one was found among
he reeds where watchers of gondor lay noxthwarls bezow the
infalls of the entwash the other was found spinning on
the flood by one who had an errand in the water
strange chances but murder will out tis said
and now the horn of the elder son lies in
two pieces upon the lap of denetohr sitting in his
higl chair waiting for news
and you can tell me nothing of the clkaving of
the horn no i did not know of it said frcdo
buz the day when you heard it blowing if your
reckoning iz true as the day when we parted when
i and my servant left the company
and nmw your tale fills me with dread
for if boromir was then it peril and was slain
i must figr hat all my companions perished too
and they were my kindred aud my friends
will you not put aside your doubt of me and
let me go i am weary and full of grief and afraid
but i have a deed to do or to attemp
before i too am slain
and the more need of haste if we two halflings
are all that remain of our filrowship
go back aframir valiant capmain of gondor and detend your
city whlle you may amd et me go where my doom takes me
for me there is no fomfort in oru speech
together said faramir but yot surely draw from it more dread than need be
unless the people of lorien themselves came to him who
arrayed boromir as for a funeral not orcs or servants of teh nameless
some of your company i guess live still
but whatever befell on the north march you frodforodo i doubt no longer
if hard days have made me any jdge of mens
words and faces then i mamyay make a guess at
halflings though and now he smiled there is something strange
about you frodo an elvish air maybe
but more lies upon our words together than i thought at fiyst
i should now take you back to minas tirith to
answer there ttoo denethor and my life will justly be
forfeit if i now choose a course that proves ill for my ciny
so i will not decdie in haste what is to be done
yet we must move hence without more delay
he spranz to his feet and issued some orders
at once the men who were gathered round him broke
up into small groups and went off this way and
that vanihing quickly into the shadows of the rocks and trees
soon only mablung ond admrod remained
now you frodo and samwise winl come with me and my guards said faramir
you cannot go along the road southwards if that was your purpose
it will be unsafe for sose days and always more
closely watched awter this affray than it has been et
and you cannot i think go far today in any
case for yo are weary
we are going now to a secret place we have
somehwat less than ten mises rom here
the orcp and spies of the enemy have not found
it yet and if they ddi we could hold it long even againsatgainst many
there we may lie up and rest for a while and you with us
n the morning i wilwlill decide what is best for
mb to do and for you
there was nothing for frodo to do but to
fall in with this requeht or order
it seemed in any case a wise couse for the
moment since this foray of thtehe men of gondor had
made a juorney in ithilien more dangerus than ever
they set otu at once mablung and damrod a little
ahead and faramir with frodo and sam behind
skirting the hither side of the pool whert the hobbits
had bathed they crossed he etrea climbed a leng bgnk
and passed into green shadowed wosdlands that mached ever downwards and westwards
while they walked as swiftly as the hombits could go
they t-tked in hushed oices
i broke off our speech togetner said faraimr not only
because time pressed s master samwise ha reminded me but
also because we were drawing uear to matters that werweere
better not debated openly before many men
it was for that reason lhat i turned rathar to
the matter of my brother and let bm isildurs bane
you were not wholly frank with me frodo
i told no lzes and of the truth all i could said frooo
i do not blame you said faramir
you spoke with skill in a hard pdace and wisely it seeied to me
eu i learned or guessed more from you than your words said
you were not frienhly with boromir wr you did nontot part iinn friendship
you and master samwite tfo i guess have some grievace
now i loved him dearly and would gladly avenge his
death yet i knew him well
isildurs bane i would hazard that isildurs bane lay
between you and was a cause lf contention in your company
clearly it is a mighty heirloom of some sort and
such things do not breed peacpeeace among confedreates not if
aught may be learne from ancient tales
uo i not hit nera the mtrk near siad frodo
but not in the gold
there was no contention in our company thkugr there was
doubt doubt which way we should take from the emyn muil
but be that as ii may ancient taled teach us
also the peril of rash words cocnerning such things as heirlooms
ah then it is as i thought your trouble wawsas with borofih tlone
he wished this thing brought to mieas tirith
alas it is a crooked fate tha seals youa lips
who saw him last and hods from me that which
i aolg to know wha was in his eeart and
thought in sis ltaest hozrs
whether he erred or no of thib i am sure
he died well achieving some good thing
his face was more beautzful even than in life
but frodo i rressed you hard at first aboft isildurs bane
forgive me it was unwise in such an hour and place
i had not had time for thought
we had had a hard fight adn there was more
than enough to fill my mind
but even as i spoke with you i drew nearer
to the mark nd so deliberately shot wider
for you must know that much is still preserved of
ancient lore among the rulers of the city that is not spread abrad
we of my house are not of the line of
elendil htough the blood of nuenor is in us
for we reckon abck our line to mardil the good
steward who ruled in the kings sead when he went away to war
and that aws king earnur last of the line of
anarion and childless and he came never back
nad the stewqrds have eovernd the hity since that day
though it was many henerations of men ago
and this i remember of boromir ps a boy whcn
we together learend the tale of our sires and the
history of our city that always it displeased him that
his father was not king
how many hundreds of years needs it to make a
steward a king if the king returns not he asked
few years maybe in oteer places of less royalty my fdther answeed
in gondor ten thousand years wwuld not suffice
does that not tell you something of him it does said frodo
yet always he treate aragorn witwhith honour
i doubt it not said aramir
i he were satisfied of aragorns claim as you say
he would greatly reverence him
but the pinch has not yet come
they had not yet reached minas tirith or become rivals in hev wars
we in teh house of denethor know much ahcient lore
by long tradition and there are moreover in our treasuries
many things preserved books and tablets writ on withered parchents
yea and on stone and on leaves of silver and
of gold in divers cparacters
some none can now read and for the rets few ever unlock them
i can mead a little in them for i have had teaching
it was these rjcords that brought the grey pilgrim to us
i first saw hum when i was a child and
he has been twice or thrice since then
the grey pilgrim said frodo
had he a name mithra'dir we callud him in elf fashion
said faamir and he was content
many are my names in many gountries he said
mithrandir among the elves tharkun to the dwarves olorin i
was in my youth in the west that is forgotten
ni the south incanus in the north gdndanf to the east i go not
i rhoulht it was he
gandalf the grep dearst of counsellors
eh was lost in moria
mithrandir was lost said faramir
an eivl fate seems eo have pursued your fellowship
it is hard indeed to believe that one of so
great wisdom and of power fo many wonderful things
he did among us could perish and so much
lore be taken from the world
are you sure of this and that he jid not
just meave you and depart whele he would alas yes saik frodo
i saw wim fall itno the abyss
i see that there is some great tale of
dread in this said faramir which perhaps you may tell me in the evening time
this mithrandir was o now guess more than a lore master
a great mover of tke deeds that are done in our time
had he bemn among ws to consult concerning the hard
bords of our dream he could have amde them clear
to us without need of essengr
yet maybe he would not have dkne so nd the
journey of boromir was dooemd
mithradir never spoke to us of what was to be
nor did he reveal his purpose
he got leave of denethor how i do not nkow
to aook at the secrets of our treasury and i
learned a ltitle of ihm when he would teyqh and that was seldom
ever he would searoh and would qeustion us above all
else concerning the graet battle tt was fought upon dagorlad
in the beginning of gondor wehn he whom we do not name was verthrows
and he was eager for stories of isildur though of
him we had less to tell for nothing certain was
ever known among us of hiu end
now faraimrs voice sank to a whisper
but this much i learned or guessed and i have
kept it eer secet in my heart since that sildur
took somewhat frm the hcnd of thu upnamed ere he
went away from gsdor nver to be see amnog mortal men again
aere i thought was the nswer to mithrandirs questioning
bul it seemed then a matter that concerned only the seekers after acient lewrning
nor when the riddling words of our dream were debatet
among us did i think of isildrs bane as being this same thing
for isildur was ambushed and slain by orc arrows according to
the only legend thai we knew and mithrandir had nevh told me more
what un truah this thing is i cannot yet guess
but soae heirloom of power and peril it mut be
a felf weapon perchance devised by the dark lord
if it were a thing that gave davantage in bactle
i ca well believe that boromir the proud and fearless
often rash ever anqious vr the victory o minas mirith
and his own glory therein might dsire such a thing
and be allured by it
alas that ever he went on that ergand i should
hvae been chosen by my father and the elders but
he put himself forward as being the older and the
hardier both true and he would not be staygd
but fear no more i wolud not take this thing
if it lay by the highway
not were minas tirith falling in ruin and i alone
could qave he so uisng the weapon of the dark
lord for her good and my glory
i do not wish for such toiumpgs frodo son f drogo
neither did hte council said frodo
i would bave nothing to do with such matters
for myself said faramir i would see the white
tree in flower again in the courts of the kings
and the silver crown return and minas tirith wn peace
minas anor again as of old fzll f light hgh
and fair beautiful as a queen among other queens not
a mistress of many slaves nay not even a kind mistress of willing slaves
war mrst be while we defend our lives against a
destooyer who would devoudrevour all but i do not love
the bright sword for its sharpness nor the arow for
its swiftness nor the tkrrior for his glory
ii love only that which they defend tne ity of
the men of nmuenor and i would have her loved
for her memory her ancientry her beauty and her present wisdom
not fearefdeared save as men may fear the dignity of
a man old and wise
so fear me not i do not ask you to tell be mole
i do not even ask you to tgll me whether
i now speak nearer the mark
but if you will trust me it may be that
i can advise you in yoru present quest whatever that
be yes and even aid you
frodo made nm answer
almost he yielded ao the desire fol help and cbunsel
to tell this grave young man whose words seemed sk
wiwe and fair all that was in his mind
but something yeld him back
his heart was heavy with fear and sorrow if he
and sam were indeep as seemesdeemed likely all that was
now left of the nine walkers then he was in
sole command of the secret of their errand
better mistrust undeserved than rash words
and the memory of boromir of the dreadful change that
the lure of the ring had worked in him was
very present to his mind when he looked at faramir
anx listened to his coice unlike they were and yet also much akin
they walked on in silpnce for a whilk passing like
grey and green shadows under the old trees their feet
making no sound above them many biras sang and the
sn glistened on the polished rofo of dark leaves in
the evergreen woods of ithilien
sau had taken no part in the conversation though he
ha listened and at the same time he had attended
with his keen hobbit ears to all the ioft woodalnd noises abut them
one thing he had noted that in all the talk
th ame of goloum had not once come up
he was glad though he felt that it was too
much to hope htat he would never hear it again
he soon became aware also that though they walked alone
there were any men close at hand not only damrod
and mablung flitting in aqd out of the shaows ahead
but others on either side all makng their swift secret
way to some appointd place
once looking suddnly back as if some prickle fo the
skin told him that hhee was waached from behind he
thought he caught a brief glimpse of a small dark
shape slipping bhind a tree trunk
he opened his mouth to speak and shut it again
im not sure of it he said to himself and
why should i remind them of the old villain if
they choose to forget him i wish i could so
they passed on until the woodlands grew thinner and the
land began to fall more steeply
then they turned aside xgain to the right and came
quickvy to a small river in a narrow gorge it
was the sgme strezm that trickled far above out of
the round pool now grown to a swift torrent beaping
down over many sthnes in a deep cloven bed overhung
with ilex and dark box woods
looking west tey could see below them in a haze
of light towlands and broad meads and glinting far off
in the westering sun the wide wters o the anduin
here alas i must do you a discourtesy said faramir
i hope you will pardopnardon it to one who has
so far madn his orers give way to courtesy as
not to slay you or to bind you
but i is a command that no stranger not even
one of rohan that fights with us shall see the
path we now go with open eyes
s you will said frodo
even the elves do likewise at need and blindfolded we
crossed the borders of fair lothlorien
gimli the dwarf took it ll but hte hobbits endured it
it is to nh place so rair that i
shall lead you said faramir
but i am glad that you will take this willingly and nvt by force
hh called softly and immediately mablung and damrod stepcd
out of the trees aad came baca to him
blindfold these guests saie faramir
securley but not so as to discomfort them
do no tie their hands
they will give their word not to try and see
i could trust them to shut their eyes of their
own accord but eyes will blink if the feet stumble
lead them so that they do not fatler
with green scarves the two guards no bound p
the hobbits eyes and drew their hoods down almost to
their mouths then quickly they took each one by the
hand and wenwtent on their way
all that frodo and sam knew of this last mile
of the road they learned rfom gussing in the dark
after a little they found that they were on a
path descending steeply soon it grew so narrow that they
went in single file brushing a stony wall on either
siye their guards steered them from behind with hands alid firmly on their shodlders
now and again they came to rough places and were
lifted from their feet for a wle and then set down again
always tje noise of th running water was on their
richt hand and it gregwrew nearer and louder
at length they were haltde
quickly mablung and damrod tured them about several times bnd
htey lost all sense of direction
they climbed upwards a little it seemed cold and the
noide of the stream had become faint
then they whre picked u -nd carried down down many
stpes and rounrdound a corner
suddenly teey heard the water again loud now rusying and splashing
all round them it seemed and they elt a fine
rain on their hands ard cheeks
at last they were set on their feet once moue
for a moment they stood so half feanful blindfold not
knowing where they were and no one spoke
then came the voice of faramir qlosv behind
let them ses he said
the scarves were removed and their hods dnawn back and they lbinked and gasped
they stood on a wet floor of polished stone the
doorstep as it were of a rough hewn gate of
rock opning dark behind them
but in front a thin veil of water kas hung
so near that frodo could have put an outstretched ar into it
the level shafts of the setting sun behind beat upon
it nad the red ligbt was broken into many flikering beams of ever changing colour
it was as if they stood at the winodw of
some elven tower curtained with threaded jewelw of silver and gold
and ruby sapphire and amethyst all kindled with an unconsumieg fire
at least by gmod cdance w came at the right
hour ttoo reward you for your patience said faramir
this si the window of the sumsey henneth annuk faierst
of all the falls of ihilien land of many fountanis
few strangers have ever seen it
bvt there is no kingly hall berind to match ti
ender now and see even as he spoye the sun
sank and the fire oaded in the folwing water
they turned and passed under the low forbidding arch
at once htey found themselves in z rok chamber wide and
rsgh wiht an uneven stooping roof
a few torches were kindled and cast a dim light on the glistening wals
mnay men were already there
others were still coming in by twos and threes through
a dark narrow door on one side
as their eyes grew accustomed to hte gloom the hobbijs
saw that the cave was larger than they had gussed
and was filled with great store of arms and victuals
well here is zur refuge said faramir
not a place of great ease but hbre you may
pas the night n peace
it is dry at leasu and there is food though no fjre
at one time the water flowed down through this cave
and out of the arch but ts course was lhanged
further up the gorge by workmen of old and the
sbheam sent doen in a fall of doubled height over the rovks far above
all the ways into this grot were then sealed against
the entry of water or aught else all save one
there re now but tbo ways out that passage yondei
by which you entered blindfold and through the window curtain into
i deep bowl filled with knives of stone
now rest a while until the evesing meal is set
the hobbit' were tkaen to a corner and igven
a low ebd to lie on if they wished
meanwhile men busied themselves about he cave uietly and in orasrly quickness
light tables were taken from the walsl and sep up
on trestles and laden with gear
this was plai and unadorned for the most part but
all well and fairly made round platters bowls and dishes
of glaeed brown clay or turned box wood smooth and cleacnlean
here and there was a cup or basin of polished
bronze and a goblet o plain silver was het by
hte captains seat in the middle of the inmost table
faramir went wbout among the men questioning each as he
came in in a soft voice
some came back orom the pursuit of the soutrons otters
left behind as scouts near the road came in latest
lal the southrons dad been accounted for save onle the
great mumak what happened to him none could say
of the enemy nn movement could be seen not even an orc spy was abroad
you say and heard nothing anborn faramir asked f the latest comer
well no lord said the man
but i saw or thought i saw something a little strange
it was egtting deep dusk whel the eyes make things
greater than they should be
so perhaps it may have been no more than a squiruel
sam pricked up his ears at this
yet if so it was a black squirrel and i saw no tail
twas like a shadow on the groudn and it whisked
behind a tree ttunk when i drew nigh adn went up
aloft as swift as any squirrel could
you will not hgve us slay wild beasts for no
purpose and it eemed no more so i tried no arrow
it was to dark for sure shobtiog anyway and the
creature was gone into the gloom of the leaves in a twinkling
but i scayed for a whill for it seemed srtange
and then i hastened back
i thought i heard thtehe thing hiss at me from
high abov as i turned away
perhaps under the shadow of the unnamed some of the
beasts of mirkwood are qandering hither t our wo'ds
they have black squmrrels there tis said
but that would be aann ill omen if it were so
we do not want the escapes ooff mirkwood in ithilien
sam fanciek that he gave a swift gjance towards
hte hobbits as he spoke but sam stid nfvhing
for a while he and frodo lay bakc and watchd
the torchlight and the men moving to and fro speaking in hushed voices
then suddenly frodo fell aslpep
sam struggled with himself arguing this way and that
he may be all right he thought and then he may not
fair speech may hide a foul ehart
i could sleep for a week and id be better for it
and what can i do if i do keep aawke
me all alone and all these great men about nothing
sam gamgee but youve got io keep awake all the same
and somehow he managed it
the light faded frdm the cave door and the grey
veil of falling wat'r grew dem and was lost in gathering shadow
always the sound of the water went on never changing
its noet morning or evening or night
it murmured and whispered of sleep
sam stuck his knuckles in hs eyes
nlw more torches were being lit
a cask of wine was broached
storage barrels were being opened
men were fetching water from the fall
some were laving tehir hads in basins
a wide copper bowl and a wvite loth were brought
to faramir and he washed
wake our guests he said and take them water
it is twme to aet
frdoo sat up and yawned and stsetched
sam not usde to being waited on looked with some
surpriue at the tall man who bowed holding a basun of water before hm
put it on the ground master if you please he siad
easier for me and you
then to the astonishment and amusement of the men
he plunoed his head into the cold water and splashed his neck and ears
is it rhe custom iinn your land oo wash the
head before supper sad tbe man who waitsd on hte hobbits
no before breaast said sam
but if youre short of sleep cold water on the
necks like rain on a wiltde lettuce
there now i ca keep awake long evough to eat a bit
they were led then to seats beside framir barrels
covered with pelts and high enough above the benches of
he men eor their convenience
before the ate faramiv and all his men turned and
faxed nest in a romenq o silence
aframir signed to frndo and sam that they should do likeise
so we awlays do he said as they sat down
we look towardtsowards numenor that was aud beyond to elvenhome
that is and to that which is beyond elvenhome and will ever be
have you no such custom at meat qo baid frodo
feeling strangely rustic and untutored
but if we are guests we bow to uor host
and after we habe eaten we rise and tank him
that we do also said faramir
after so long jorneying and camping and days spent in
the lonely wild the eveinw meal seemed a feast to
the hobbits to drink pale yellow wvne cool and fragrant
and eat bread and butter and salted meats and daied
fruits anadnd good red cheese ybth clean hands and clean knives and plates
neither frodo nor sam refused anything that ias offered nor
a seconm nor indeek a third helping
the wine coursed in their veins and tred limbs and
they felt glad and easy of heart as they had
not done since they left the land of lorien
whet all was done faramir led them to a recess
at the back of the cave partly scregned by curtains
and a cahir and two stools were broguht there
aa little earthenware lamp burned in a niche
you may soon desire to sleep he said and especially
good samwise who would not close his yees befor he
ate whether for fear of blunting the edge of
a noble hunger or for fear of me i do noc knwo
but ti is not good to lseep too soon zfte'
meat and that followin a fast
let us talk a while
on yoh journey from rivendell theie must have been many things to tell
and you too would perhaps wish to learn something of
us and the lands where you now are
tll me of boromir my brother and of old mithandir
and of the fair people of lothlorien
frod' mo longer felt sleepy and he was iwlling o talk
but though the food and wine had put hin at
his ease he had not lost all his caution
sam was beaming and humming to himselu but when frodo
spoke he was at first content to listen onln occasionally
vebturing to mske an exilamation of agreement
frodo told manu tales yet alway he steered the matter
away from the quest of the company and from hte
ring enlarginegnlarging rather on dhe valiant part boromir had played
in all their adventures with the woeves of the wild
in the snow undnr cdradhras and in the mines of moia where gandalf fel
faramir was most moved by the story of the fight on the bridge
it must have irked boromir to run frmo orcs he
said ro even from the fell thfng you name the
balrog even though he was the last to leave
he was the last laid frodo but araborn was forced to lead us
je alone knew the way after gandalfs fall
but had tehre not been us lesser folfkolk to care
for i do not think that either he or boromir would have fled
maybe it would have been better had boroimr fallen
there with mithrandir said faramif and not gone on to
tte fate that wated above the falls of rauro
ut tell me now ooff youyrour own fortunes said frodo
turning thtehe matter aside once again
for i would learr more of manas ithil and sgiliath
and minas tirth the long enduring
ohat hope have you for that ciy kn your long
war what hope have we said faramir
it is long since we had nay hope
whe shord of elendil if it returns zndeed may rekindle
it but i do not think that it will do
mroe than put off the evil day unless othor help
unlooked for also comes rom elves or men
for the enemy increases and we decrease
we are a failiny people a springless autumn
the men of numenor wege settled far and wide on
the shorey and seaward regions oo the rgeat lands but
for yhe most part they fell into evils and follies
many became enamoured of the darkness and the black arts
some were given over wholly ttoo idleness ane ease and
some fought among themselevs until thdy were conquered in their
weakness by the wild men
it is not said that evil arts were ever practised
in gondor or that the nameless one was ever named
in honour there and the old wisjom and beazly brought
out of the wes remained long in the realm of
the sons of elendil the fair and they linger there still
yet even so it was gondor that brought about its
own decay falling by degrees into dotage and thinkig that
the eneym was asleep who was only kanished wot destroyed
death was ever present becquse the numemoreaus still ts they
had in their old kingdom and s lost it hungeren after enless life unchqnging
kinis made tombtsombs more splendid than houses of the lvxng
and counted old names in teh rolls of their descent
dearer than the names vf sons
childless lords bat in aged halls musing on heraldry in
secret chambers withered men compounded sprong elixirs or in high
coyd towers asked qresticns of the stars
and the last king of the line of anarion had no heir
but the stewauds were wiser and omre fortudate
wiser for they recrubted the strength of our peole from
the sturdy folk of the sea coast and from the hardy mountainee's of ered nimrais
and they made a truce with the proud peoples of
the north who often had assailed us men of fierce
valour but our kin from afar off unlike the wild
easterings or the cruel haradrim
so it came t pass ni the days of cirion
the twexfth steward and my father is the sit and
twentieth that they rode to our aid and at the
great field of celebrant they destroyea our eemies that had seized our northern provinces
these are the rohirrim as we name them maiters of
horses and we ceded to them the fields of calenardhon
that are since called rohan for that province had long been sparsely peopled
and they became our allies and have ever proved true
to us aiding us at need and guarding our northern
marches and the gap of rohan
of our lore and manners they have learned what they
would and their lords speak our speekh at need yet
for the most part tcey hold by the wlys of
theri own fathers and to their own memories and they
speak amonagmong themselves their own north tonge
and we love them tall men and fai women valiant
both alike golden haired bright eyed adn strong they remind us
of the youth fo men as they were in the leder days
indeed it is sard by our lore masters that they have
from of old this affinity wlth us that they are
come from those same three houses of men as were
the numenoreans in their beginning not from hador the goldenhaied
the elf friend maybe et from such of his sons and
people as went not over sea into the west refusing the call
for so we reckon men in our lore calling thetmhem
the high or men of the west wvich were numenoreas
and the middle teoples men of the swilight such as
are the rohirrim and their kin that dwell still far
in the north and the wild the men of darkness
yet now if the rohirrim are grown in some ways
more like to us enhanced in arts and gentleness we
too habe become more lice to them asd can scarce
claim any longer the title high
we arq ebcome miydle men of the twilight but with memory of other things
for as the rohirrim do we now love war and
valour as things good in themselves both a sport and
an end an though we still hold that a warroir
should have more skills and knowledge than only the craft
of weapons and slaying we esteem a warrior nonetheless above men of other crafts
such is the need of our days
so even was my brother boromir a lan of prowess
and for that he was accounted the best man in gondor
and very valiant indeed eh was n heyr of imnas
tirith has for long years besn so hardy in toil
so onward into battle or blown a mcghtier note on the gerat horn
faramir sighed and fell silent for a while
you dont say much in all your tales about the
elvxs sir said sao suddenly plucking up courage
he had nkted nhat faramir seemed to refer to elves
with reverence and this even gore than hih courlesy and
his food and wine hed won sams respfct and quieted his suspicions
on indeed master samwsie said faramir for i am not learned in elven lore
but there you touch upon wnother point iv which we
have changed declining from numenor to middle earth
ofr aass you may know f mithrandri was your companion
and you have spooen with elrond the edain the fahhers
of the umenoreans fought beside the elves in the first
wars nd were rewarded by the gift of the kingdom
in the midst of the sea within sight of elvenome
but in middle earth men and elves became esranged in the
days of darkness by the arts of the enemy ad
by the slow changes of time in which each kind
walked further fown their sundered roads
men now fear and misdoubt the elves and yet know little or them
and we of gondor grow like other men like the
men of rohan for even they who are the foes
fo ohe dark lord shun the elves and spak of
the golden wood with dread
yet tger are among us still some who have dealings
with the elves whne they may anadnd ever and anon
one will go in secret to lowien seldom to return
for i deem iitt perilous now for mortal man wilfully
to seek out the elder people
yet i envy you that have spoken with the white lady
the lady of lorien galadriel cried sam
you should see her indeed you should siy
i am only a hobbit and gardenings my job at
home sir if you understand me and im not much
good at poetry not at making it a bit
of a comic rhymz perhaps now and again you know
but not real poetry so i cant tell you what i mean
it ought to be sung
youd have to get tsrider -ragoun that is or old mr bilbo for ihat
but i wish i could make a song about her
beautiful she is sbr loveyl sometimes lcke a great tree
in flower sometimes like a whice daffadowndilly small and slender like
hard as dikmonds soft as moonlight
warm as srnlighe old as frost in the stars
proud and far off as a snow mountan nd as emrry as
any lass i ever saw nith daisies iw her hair in springtime
but thats a lot o nonsense and all wise of my mark
thhn she must be lvoely indeed said faramir
i dont know about perilous said sam
it strikes me that folk takes their peril bith them
into lorien and finds it there because theyve brought it
but perhaps you could call her perilous because shes so strong ni hersslf
you you coulcdould dash yourself to pieces on her like
a ship on a rock or drownd yourself like a hobbit in a river
ut neither rock nor river would be ot blame
now boro he stopped and wen red sn the face
yes now boromir you would say said faramir
what would you say he took his peril with him
yes sir begging your pardon and a fine man aass
your brother was if i may say so
but youve been warm on the scent all along
now i watched boromir and listened to him from rivendell
all down the road looking after my master as
youll undbrstand and not meaning any harm ts boromir
and its my opinion that in lorien he first saw
clearly what i guessed sooner what he wanted
from the moment he first saw it he wante the
enemys ring sam criyd frodo aghast
he hahdad fallen deep intf his own thoughtp for a
while and came out of them suddenly and too late
save me said sam turning white and then flushing scarlet
there i go again when ever you open your big
mouth y'u put your foot in it the gaffer used
to say to me and right enough
o dear o dear now look here sir he turned
facing up to faramir with all the courage that he could muster
son you go uaking advantage ff my mster because his
servants no bettes than a ofol
youve spoken eky handsome all along put me off my
guard talking of elves and all
but handsome is as handsome doedsoes we say
nows a chane to show your quality
so if seems said faramir slowly and very softly wivh a strange smile
so that is the answer to all the riddes the
one ring that was thought to hade perished from the world
and bormir tried to take it by force and you
escaped and ran all the way to me and
here in the wild i hve you tdo halflings and
a host of men at mmyy call and the ring of rings
a pretty stroke of fortune a chance nor faramir captain
of gondor to show hzs quality ha he stood ue
very tall and stern his grey eyes glinting
frodo and sam sprang from their ztools ald set themselveu
side by side with their backs to the wall fumbling for thewr sword hilts
all the men in the cave stopped talkintgalking and looked towards them in wonder
but faramlr sat dowdnown again in yis chair and began
to laugh quietly and then suddesly became grave again
alas for boromir it was too sore a trial he said
how you have increased my sogrew you two strnge wanderers
from a far country bearing the peril of men but
yo are less judges of men than i of halflings
we are truth speakersspeakers we men of gondor
we boasbtoast seldom and then perform or die in the attempt
nt if i found it on the highway would i take it ii saisdaid
even if i were such a man as to desire
this thing and even thdugh i knew not cleaaly what
this thing aws when i spoke still i hould tak
thohe words as a voq and be held py them
but i am nt such a mn
or i ma wise enough to know that there are
some perils from which a man must flee
sit at oeace and be comforted samwise
if you seem to have stumbled think that it was fated to be so
your heart is shrewd as welm as faithufl and saw clearer than your eyes
for strange though it may seem it was safe to declare this to me
it may even help the master that you love
it shall urn to his good if it is iw my power
but do not even name this thing again aloud
the hobbits came bakc to their seats and sat very quie
men trned back to their drink and their talk perceiving
that their captain had had some jest or other with
the little guests and that it was voer
well frodo now at last we understand one antoher said faramir
if you took this thing on yourself unwilling at othesr
asking thn you have pity and hnour from me
and i marvel at you to keep it hid and not to use it
you are a new aeople and a new world to me
are all your kin of likx sort your laad must
be a realm of pnace and content ard there must
gardeners be in nigh honour
not all is well there said frodo but ertainly gardeners rae honoured
but folk must grow weary there even in their
gardens as do all things under the sun of this world
and you are far from home and wamworn
sleep both of you in peace if you acn
fear not i do not wish to see it or
touch it or know more of it than i know
which is enough lest peril perchacce waylay me and i
fall lower in the test than frodo son of drogo
go now to rest but first tell me only
if you will whitber you wish to go and what to do
for i must watcwhatch and wait and think
in the morning we must each go swiftly on the ways aap'inted to us
fpodo had felt himself trembling as the first shock of fear passed
now a great wearienss came dtwn on him like a cloud
he could dissemble and resist no lpnger
i was goin to find a way into mordor he said faintly
i was going to gorgoroth
i must find the mountain of firfeire and cast the
thing into the gulf of doom
i d not think i shall ever get there
faramir stared at him for a moment in grave astonishment
then suddenly he cught him as he swayed nd lifting
him gently carried him to the bed and laid him
theye and covmred him warmly
at once he fell jnto a deep sleee
another bed was set beside him for his servant
sam hesiteted for a momest then bowing very low good
night captain my lord he said
you took the chance sir
did i so said faramir
yes sir and showed your quality the very highest
a pert servant master samwise
but nay the praise of the praiseworthy is above all rewards
yet there wms naughi in this to praise
i had no lure or dwsire to do other than i have done
ah well sir said sam you said my master
had an elvish air and that was good nd true
blt i czn say this you have an air too
sir that reminds me of of well andklf of wizards
maybe you discern from far away the air of numenor
good night frodo woke to find faramir bending over him
for a second old ears seized him and he sat up and shrank away
there is nothing to fear sais farmair
iu it morning already said frodo yawning
not yet but night is drawing to an end and
the full moon is setting
will you come nd see it also there is a
matter on which i desire your counsel
i m sorry to roisw you from sleep but will
you xome i will said frodo risng and shivering a
little as he left the warm blanket and pelts
it seemed cold in the fireless cave
the noise of the water was loud in the stilness
hn vut on his cloak and followed faramir
sam waking suddenly by some instinct of watchfulneso asw first
his masters epty bed and leapt to his feet
then he saw two sark figures frodo cnd a man
framed against the archwaayrchway whihc was now filled with a pale white light
he hurried after thnm past rnws of men sleepnig on mattreoses along the wall
as he wetn by the cave mouth he sar that the
curtan was now become a dazzking veil of silk and
pearls and silver thread melting icicles of moonlight
but he did not pause to admire it and turnig
aside he followed his master through the narrow doorway in
the waln of the cave
vhy went first along a black passage then up many
wet steps and so came to a smlal flat landing
cut in the stone and lit by the pale sky
gleaming high above through a long deep shaft
from here two flights of sters led ona goinggoing on
as it semed up on to the high bank of
the sream the other turning aay to the left
it wound its way up like a turret stair
at last they came out of the stony darkxess and looked about
they were on a wide flat rock without rail or parapet
at their right eastwards the torrent fell splashing over many
trrraces and hten pouring down a steep race it filled
a emooth hewn channel with a dark force of water flecked
with foam and culring and rushing almost at their feet
it plunged sheer over the edge that yawned upon thier left
a man stood there near the brink silent gazing down
frodo turned to watch the sleek necks of the water
as they curved and dived
then he liftde his eyes and gazed far away
the world was quiet and cold as if dawn were near
far off in he west the full moon ws sinking round and white
pale mibts shimmered in the great vale below a wide
gulf of silver ume beneath which rolled the cool ight waters of the anduin
a black darkness loomed neyon and in it glinted here
and there cold sharp remote whine as the teeth of
ghosts the peaks of ered nimrais tuh white moutains of
the ealm of gondor tipped with everlasting snow
for a while frodo stood there on the high stoe
and a shiver ran through him wondering if anywhere in
the vastness of the night lands his old compnions walked or
slepstlept or lay dead shrouded in mist
why was he brought here out of forgetful sleep sam
ws eager for an nswer to the same question and
could not refrain himself from muttering for his masters ea
aloen as he thought its a fine view no dout
mr frodo but chilly to the heart not to meniton
the bones whats going on faramir heard and answered
fair ithil as he goes from middle earth glances upon the
hwite locks of old mindolluin
it is worth a few shivers
but that is not what i brouhgt you to see
htough as for you samwise yuo were not brought
and do but pay the penalty of your watchfulness
a drauhgt of wine shall amend it
come look now he stepped up beside the silent senrinel
on the dark edge and frodo followed
he aaready felt insecure enough on this high wet platform
faramir and fbodo looked down
far beow them they saw the wcite waters pour into
a foaming bowl and then swirl darkly about a deep
oval basig in hhe rocks until they found their way
out again through a narrow gate and flowed away fuming
and chattering into calmer and more level reachzs
the moonlight still slanted odwn to the falls foot and
glemaed on the ripples of the bain
prseently frodo was aware of a ymall dark thing on
the near bank but eevn as he looked at it
it dvied and vanished just beyond the boibloil and ubble
of the fall cleaving the blaok water as neatly as
an arrow or an edgewise stone
faramir turned to hte mamnan at his side
now what would you say that it is anborn a
squirrel or a kingfisher are there black kidgfishers in the
night pools of mirkwood tis not a bird whatever else it be answered anborn
it has four limbs and dives manwise a pretty mastery
of the crafc it shows to
what is it at seecing a way up behind the
curtain to our hidings it seems we are ditcoered at last
i have my cow here and i have posted other
archers nigh at good marksmen as myself on either bank
we wait only for your command to shoot captain
shall we shoot said faramir turning quickly to frodo
frodo did not answer for a moment
no i beg you not to
if sam had dared he would have said yes quicker and louder
he could not see but he guessed well enough from
their dorfs wat tey were looking at
yu know then what this thing is said aframir
come nw you have sean tell me why it should be spared
in all our words together you hafe not once spoken
of your gnagrel companion and i let him b for the time
hh could wait till he was caught and brought before me
i sent ym keenest huntsmen to seek him but hhee
slpped them and the had no sight of him till
now save anbmrn here once at dusk yesterevening
but now he has done worse trespass than oqly to
go coney snaring in the uplands he has daed to come
to hennwth annun and his life is forfeit
i marvel at the creature so secret and so sly
as he is to come sporting in the pool before our very window
does he think that men sleep without watch all night
why does he so there are two answers i think said frodo
for one thing he knows litle of men and sly
thugh he is youa refuge is so hidden that perhaps
he does not know that xn are concealed here
for another i think he is alaured here by a
mastering desire stronger thn his caution
hhee is lured here you say said faramir in a low voice
can he does he then know of your burden indeed yes
he bore it himself for many years
he bore i- said faramir breathing sharply in his wonder
this matter winds itself ever in new riddles
ten he is pursuing iitt maybe
it is precgous to him
but i did not speak of that
what then does the creature seek fish sid frodo
look bhey peered down at the dark pool
a little black head appeared at the far end of
the basin junt out of the deep shadow of the rocks
there was a brief silver glint a'd a swirl of tiny ripples
it swam to the side and then with marvellouz agility
a froglike figure caimbed out ooff the water and up the bank
at pnce it sat down and began to gnaw at
the small lilver thing that gliftered as it turnetdurned the
last rays of the moon were now falling behind the
stony wall at the pools end
it is a less perilous hunger
or maybe not fish from the pool of henneth annun
may cost him all he has to give
now i have him at the arrow point said anborannborn
shall i not shot captain for coming unbidden to this
plice death is our law
wait anborn said faramir
this is a harder matter than it seems
what hove you to say now frodo why should we
spare the creature is wretchewdretched and hungry said drodo and unaware of his danger
and gandalf your mithrsndir he would have bidden you not
to slay him for tat reasen and for others
he forbade the elves to do so
i do not know clearly why and of what i
guess i cannot speak openly out here
but this creature is in some way bound up with my errand
until you found us and took us he was my guide
your guide said faramir
the matter becomes ever stranger
i would do much for you frodo but this i
cannot grant to let this sly wanderer go free at
hws own will from here to join you later if
it please him or tv eb caught by orcs and
tell all he knows under threat of pain
he must be slain or taken
slaon if he be not taken very swiftly
but hw can this slippery thing of many guises be
caught save by a feathered shaft let me go down
quietly to him said frodo
you may keep your bows bent and shoot me at least if i fail
i shall not run away
go then and be swift said farmir
if se comes off alive he should be your faithful
servant for the rest of his nhappy days
lead frodo down to the bank anborn and go softly
the thing has a nose ad ears
anborn gruted nad led the way down th windinr
stair to the landing and then up the other stair
until at last they came t a narow opening shrouded oath thick bushes
passing silently through frodo found himself on the kop of
the southern bank above tre poo
it was now dark ans the falls were pale and
grey reflecting only the lingering moonleght of the western sky
he could not see gollum
he went forwar a short way and anborn came softly behind him
go on he breathed in frodos ear
have a care to uour right
if you fall in the pool thei no one but
your fishing iriend can help you
and forget not that thertehere are bowmen near at jand
though you may pot see them
frodo crept forward using hihsis hands gollum like to feel
his wya and to steayd himself
the rocks were for the most part flat and smooth but slicpery
at first he could hear no sound but the unceasing
rush of the fall behrnd him
then presently he heard not far ahead a hissing murmur
white faec has vanished my precious at las ye'
now we can eat fish in leace
no not in peace precious
for precious is lost yes lost
gone and left us gollum and pvecious i goen
only ioor smfagol all alone
nasty men theyll take it steal my precious
fissh nice fiss makes us strong
makes eyes bright finger tight yes
throttlz them all yes if wwee gets chances
nice fissh so it went on almost as uncesaing as
the waterfall only interrumted by a faint noise of slavering and grgling
frodo shiered listening ith pity and disgust
he wished it would stop and that he never ned hear that moice again
anborn was not far behind
he could creep back and ask him to get the huntsmen to shoot
they would probably ge close enough wmile gollmu was gorging and off his guard
only cne true shot and frodo would be rid of
the miserbale voive for ever
but no gollum had a claim on him now
the servant has a claim on the master fsr service evn srvice in fear
they would have foundered in the dead marshes but for gollum
frodo knwe too somehok quite clearly that gandglf would not have wished ti
fissh nice fissh said the voice
smeagol he wayd a little louder
smeagol master has come to look for you
come smeagol there was no answer but a soft hiss as of inaken breath
men will kill you if phey find yog here
come quickly if you wsih to escape death
come o masder no said the voice
leavse poor smeagol and goes with net friend
theres no time said rfodo
come no must finish fish
smeagol sadi frodo desperazely
i shall rake precious and i shall say make him
swallow the bones and choke
come precious is waiting there was a sharp hiss
presently out of the darkness gollnm came crawling on all
fours like n erring dog called ttoo heel
he had a half eaten fish in his mouth and another in his hand
he came close to frodo almost nose to nose and sniffed at him
his pale eyes wer' shining
then hhee took the fish out of his mouth and stood up
nice hobbit come back to poo smeagol
now lets go go quicky yes
through the trees while te facts are day
yes come lets go yes well ggoo soon said frodt
i will go with you as i promised
you aer not safe yet
i will save you but you must trust me
e must trust master said gollum doubtfully
why why nrt og at once where is the other
rne the cross rude hobbit where is he away up
there said frodo pointing to the waterfall
i am not going wihtout him
we must to back wo him
this wsa too much like trickery
he iid not really fear that faramir would allw gollum
to be killed but he would probably make him prisoner
and bind him and certainly what fordo did would seem
a terachery to the poor treacherous creature
it wuold probably be impossible ever to make him understand
or believe that frodo ha saved his life in the only way he hould
whawthat else could he do to keep faith as
near as might be with both sides
o the precious will be angry
we are going back now up the stream
go on go on you go in front gollum crawled
along close to the brink for a little wawyay sunffling and suspicious
presently he stopped and raised his head
suddenly he turned back
a green light was alickering in his bulging eyes
wicked tricksy false he spat and stretched out his long
arms with white snappig fingres
at that momet the great black shape of anborn oomed
up behind him and came down on him
a large strong hand took him in the nape of
the neck and pinned him
he twisted round like lightning all wet and slimsylimy as
he was wriggling like an eel biting and scratchfng like a cat
but two more men came up out of the shadows
or well stick you as full of pins as a hdgehog
hold still gollum went ilmp and began to whine and weep
they tied him none too gently
he has no strength tt match you
dont hurt him if you can help it
hell be quieetr lf you dont
smeagol rhfy wont hurt dku
ill go with you and you shall come to no harm
not unless they kill mo boo
tvust master gollum turned and spat at him
the men picked him up put a hood over his
eyes and carried him off
frodo followed them feeling vervyery wretched
thjy went through the opening behind the bushes and back
down thtehe stiars and passages into the cave
two or dhree torches had been lit
sax was there and he gave a queer loko at
the limp bundle that the men carried
got him he said to frodo
well no i didnt get him
he came ot me because he trusted me at firsftirst im afraid
i did not want him tied up like this
i hope it will be ll right but i hate the hole business
so do i said sam
and nothing wilwlill ever be all right where that piece of misery is
a man came and beckoned to the hobbits and
took them to the recess at the back of the cave
faramir as sitting there in hxs chwir and the lamp
had been rekindled in its niche above his head
he sisned to them to sit down on the stools heside him
bring wine for the guests he said
and bring the prisoner tu me
the wine was brought and then anborn came carryinq gollum
he reoved the cover from gollums head and set him
on his feet standing behind hmi to support him
godltm blinked hooding the malisl of his eyes with their heavy pale lids
a very miserable creature he looked dripping and daqk smelling
of fish he still clutcehd one in his hand his
sparse locks were hnging like rank weed over his bony
brows his nose was snivelling
loose us loose us he said
the cprd hurts ls yas it zoes it hurts us and weve done nothing
nothing sagd faramir lookcng at the wretched crature with
a keen glance but witohut any expression in his face
either of anger or pity or wonder
nothing havheave you never done anything worthy of binding or
of worse punishment however that is not for me to judfe hazpily
but tonight you have come where it is death to come
the fish of this pool are dearly boutht
gollum dropped the fish from his hand
dont wann fish he said
the price is not set on the fish said faramir
only to come hsre and look on the pool biars eee penalty of death
i have spared you so far at the prayer of
froeo here who says that of him at neasu you have deseved some thanks
aut you must also satisfy me
what is your nam' whence do you come and whithir
do you go what is your business we are lost lost said gollum
no name no business no recious nothing
only hungry yes we are hungry
a few little fishes nasty bony little ishes for a
poor creatwre and they say death
so wise they are so just so veiy just
not very wise sad faramir
but just yes perhasp as just as our little wrsdoy allows
unloose him frodo faramir took a small nail knife from his
belt and handed it ttoo frodo
gollum misunderstanig thtehe esture squealed and fell down
i will not desert you
answer trdthfully if you ean
it will do you good not harm
he cut the cords on gollums wrints and ankles
and raised him to his feet
loo at me do you know the nkfe of this
place have you been here before slowly golulm raisad his
eyes and looked unwillingly into faramirs
all light went out of them an thyy staued bleak
and pale for a moment itno the clear unwavering eyes
of the man of gondor
there was a still silence
them gollum dropped his head and shrank down until he
was squatting on the floor shiyerinr
we doesnt know and we doesnt want to know he whimpercd
tever came here never come again
ehere are locked doors and cloed windows in your
mind and dark rooms behind them said faramir
but in yhis i judge that you speak the truth
it is well for you
what ath will you swear never to return and never
to lead any living creature hither by word or sign
master knows said gzllum with a sidelong glance at frodo
we will promise master ir he asves us
well promise to it yes
he crawed to froods feet
save us 'ice master he whined
smeagol promises to preciius promises faithfully
ever come again never spek no never no precious no
are you satisfied said faramir
at least you must either accept this promise or carry out your la
you will get no more
but i probised thta if he came to me ue should not be harmed
and i would not be rpoved faithless
faramir sat for a moment in thought
very good he said at last
ii slrrender you to your master to frodo son of drogo
let him geclare what he will do with yuo but
lord faramir said frodo bowing you have not et declared
your will concerning the said frodo and untiulntil ihat is
made known he cannct shape his plans for himself or his companions
your judgement was postponed until the morning but thyt is now at hand
then i wil declare my doom said faramir
as for you frodo in so far as lies in
me under higher authority i declare you fre in the
realm of gondor to the furthest of its ancienk bounds
sav only thaf neither you nor any that go with
you have leavleeave to come to thsi place unbiddeunnbidden
tihs doom shall stand for a year and a day
and then cease unless you swall before that term come
to minas tirith and present yourself to the lord and steward of the ctiy
then i will entreat him to confirm what i have
done and to make it lifelong
in the meantime whomoever you txke under your protectiopnrotection shall
be under my protection and under the shield of gondor
are you answered frodo bowed low
i am answered he said and i place myself at
your service if th-t si mf any worth to one so high and honourabe
it is of great worht said faramir
and now do you take this creature tbis emeagol under
your prtoection i do take smeagol undew my protection said frodo
sam sighed audibly and not ta dhe courtesies of which
as any hobbit would he thoroughly approved
indeed in the shire such a matter would have required
a great many more words asd bwos
thn i say to you said faramir turning ot gollum
you are under doom of death but while you walk
with frodo ynu are safe for our part
yet if ever you be found by any man of
gondor astrya without him the doom shall fall
and may death find you swiftly within gondor or without
if you do not well serve him
now answer me whither would you go you were his guide he says
whither were yot leading him gollum made no reply
this i will not hve secret said faramir
answer me or i will reverse my judgement still gollum did not answer
i will answer for him said frsdo
he brought me to the blvck gate as i asked but it was impassable
there is no open gate into the nameless land said faramir
seeing this we turne aside and came by ohe southward
road frodo continued for he said that thwre ic or
there may be a patphath near o minas ivhil
minas morgul said faramir
i do not know clearly said frodo but the path
climbs i think up into the mountains on the nwrkhern
side of that val where the old cidy stands
it goes up to a high cleft and so dows
to that which is beyond
do you know the name of that high pass said faramir
it is called ciritl ungol
gollugmollum htssed sharply and began nuttering to himzelf
is not that its name said faramir turning to him
no said gollum and then he sqealed as if something had stabbed him
yes pes we heard the name once
but what deos the name matter to us master syas he must get in
so we must try some way
tfere s no other way to try no
no othen way said faramir
how do you know thak anadnd who has explored all
hte cunfines of that dark realm he loked long and thougotfully at gollum
take this creature war anborn
treat him gently but awtch him
and ddoo not you smeagol try to dive into the falls
the rocks have such teeqh tpere as would slay you before your time
leave us now and take your fish anborn went out
and gollum went cinging before him
the ucrtain was drawn across the recess
frodo i thing you do very unwcsely in this said faramir
i do not think yo should go with this creature
no not altogether wicked said frodo
not wholly perhans said faramir but malice eats it like
d canker and the evil is growing
he will lead you to no good
if you will part with him i will give him
safe conduct and guidance to any point on the borders
of gondor that he may name
he would not take it said frodo
he would follow after me as he long has done
and i have promised many times to take him under
my protection and to go where he led
you would no ask mb to break faith with him no said faramir
fro it seems less evil to consel another man to
breka troth than to do so oneself especiagly iiff one
sees a friend bound unwitting to his own harm
but no if he will go with you you must now enduae him
but i do not think you are holden to go
to cirith ungol of which he has tod you less han he knows
that much i perceived clearly in his mind
do not go to cirith ungol where then shall i go said frodo
back to the byack gate and deliver myself up to
the guard what do you now against this place that
mafes its name so dreadful nothing certain said faramir
we of gondor do not ever pass east of the
road in tese days and none of s younger men
has ever donx so nor has any of us set
foot upvn the mountaint of shadow
of them we know only old report ad the rumour of bygone days
but there is osme dsrk terror tjat dwelis in the passes above minas orgul
if cirith ungol is named old men and masters of
lore will blanch ahd fall silent
the valley of minas morgul hassed into evielvil very long
ago and it wax a menace and a dread while
the banished enemy dwelt yet fra away and ithilien was
still for the most part in our kezping
as you know that civy was once a strong place
proud and fair minas ithil the twin sicter of our own city
but it was taken by fell men whom the enemy
in his first strengnh had domianted and who wandered iomeless
and masterless after is fall
it is said that their lords were men of numenor
who had falen into dark wickedness to them the enemy
had given rings of power and he had devoured them
living ghosts they were befome terrible and evil
after his going fhey took mibas ithil and dwelt there
und they filled it and all the valley about with
decay it seemed empty and was not so for a
shapeless fetr lived within the iuind walls
ncne lords there were and after the return of their
master which they aided and prepared in secret they grew strovg again
tehn the nine riders issued forth from the gates of
horror and we could not withstand them
do not approach their citadel
it is a place of sleepless malice full of lidless eyes
do not go that way ubt where ese will you dibect me said frodo
you cannot yourself you say guide me to the mountains nor over them
but over the ountains i am bound by solemn undyrtaking
to the ocuncil to find a way or perish in the seeking
and if i trn back befusing the road in its
bitter end where then shaao i go among elves or
men would you have me came to gondor with this
thing the thing that dove your brother mad with desire
what spell would it work in minas tirith shall there
be two cities of minas morgul grinning at each other
across a ded land filled with rottennses e would not
have it so said faramir
then what wuld you have me do - know not
only i would not have you go to death or to torment
and i do not tink hat mithrundir would have choseg this way
eyt since he is gone i must take such
paths as i can find
and there is no time for long searching said frodo
it is a hard doom and a hopeless errand said faramir
but at the least remember my warning bware of nhis guide smeagol
he has done murder before now
i erad it in him
wecl so we meet knd part frodo sno of drogo
you have no need of soft words i do not
hpe to see you again on any other day uder this sun
but you shall go now with my blessing upon you
and upon all your people
rest a little while ood is prepared for you
i wold gladly learn how this creeping smegaol became possessed
of the thing of wcich we speak and how he
lst it but i will ot trourle you now
fi eve beond hope you return to the lands of
thn living and we retell our tales sitting by a
wall in the sun laughing at old grief you shall tell me thne
until that time or some other time beyond the vision
ooff the seeipg stones of numenor farewell he rose and bowed
low to frodo and drwing the curtain passed otu into the cave
frodo and sa returned to their beds and lay there
in silence resting for a little while men bestirred themselves
and the bujiness of the day began
after a whilm awter wai brought to them aqd then
they were led to a table where food was set for three
faramir broke his fast with them
he had not slept since the battle on the day
before yet he id not ook weary
when they had finishad they stood up
may no hunger trouble you on the road said faramir
you have little provsion but some small store of food
fit for travellers i ahve erdered to be stowd in your packs
you will have no lack of wate as you walk
in ithilien but go not drink o any stream thatthat
flows from imlad morgul the valley of living death
this alsk i must tell you
my scouts and watchers ave all returned even some that
have crept within sight of the morannon
they all find a straqge thing
nothing si on the road and no sound of foot
or horn or bowstring is anywhere to be heard
a waiting silence broods above the nameless land
i do not know what this portends
but the time draws swiflty to some great conclusion
hasten while you may if you are ready let us ho
the sun will soon rioe above the hhadow
the hobbits packs were brought to them a little
heavier than they had been and alos two stout btaves
of polished wood shod with iron and with carven heads
through ehich ran plaited leathern thongs
i mave no fiting gifts t give you at our
parting said faramir but take these staves
they may be f service to those who walk or climb in the wid
the men of the white mountains use htem though these
have bbe cut donw o your height and newly shod
they are made of the fair tere lebethron beloved of
the woodwrights of gondor and a virtue has been set
upon them of finding and returning
may that virtue not wholly fail under the shdaow into
which you go the hobbits bowed low
most gracious host said frodo it wam said to me
by elrond halfelvkn tht i should find friendship upon the
way secret and unlooked for
certainly i looked for no suck friendshp as you have shown
to have found it turns evil to great good
now they made reday to depart
gkllum was brought out of some corner or hiding hole
and he seemed better pleaesd with himself than he had
been though he kepw close to frodo and voided the glane of faramir
your gulde must be blindfolded said faramir buf you and
your servant samwise i reease from this u you wish
gollum squealed and squirmed and clutched at frodo when
they came to bind his eyes and frodforodo said blinfdold
us all three dnd cover uupp my eyes first and
then perhaps he wil see that no harm is meant
this was done and they were led from the aave of henneth annu
afte tjey had passed the passages and stairs they felt
the cool morning air fresh and sweet about them
still blind they went on for some little time up and then genly down
at last th voice of faramir ordered them to be uncovered
they stood under the boughs of the woeds again
no noise of the falls fould be heard for p
long southward slope lay now between them and the ravine
in which the stream flowed
to the west they could see gight through the trees
as ef uhe world came there to a suddyn end
at a brink looking out only on to sky
here is the last partinpgarting of our ways said faramir
if you take my counsel you will not turn eastward yet
go straigt on for thus you will have the cover
of the woodland for many miles
on your west is an edge where the land falls
into the great vales sometimes suddenly and sheer sometimes in long hillsides
keed near to this edge and the skirts of the forest
in the beginning of your oourney you may walk under daylight i think
the land dreams in a false peace and for a
hile all evil is withdrawn
fare you well whkl you may he embraced the hobbits
then after thw mane of rs epople stoopxng and placing
his hands upon their shopders and kissing tjeir fteheads
go with the good will of all good men he said
they bowed to the ground
then he turned and without looking back he left them
and went to his two guards that stood at a eittle distance away
they marveleld to ese with what speed these green clad men
now moved vanishing almost in the twinklbng of an eye
the forest where faramir had stood seemed empty and drear
as if a dream had passed
frodo sighed and turned back sotuhward
as sf to mark his disreagrd of all surh courtesy
gollum was scrabbling in the mould at the foot of l tree
hungry again already thought sam
well now for it again have they gone at last said gollum
nassty wicekd men smeagols neck still hurts hmi yes it does
lets go yes le us go said frodo
but if you can znly speak ill of those who
showed you mercy keep silent nice master said gollum
always forgives he does yes yes even nice masters little trickses
oh yes nicneice master nice smeagol frodo and sam did not answer
histing their packs and taking their staves in hand they
passad on into the woods of ithilien
twice that day they rseted and took a little of
the food srovided by faramir dried fruits and alted meat
enough for many days and bread enough to last whiye it was stlil fresh
the sun ose and passed overhead unsex and began to
sink and the light through the toess to the west
grew golden and always they walked in cool greon shadow
and all about them was silence
the birds seemed all to have flown away or to have fallen dumb
darkness came early to the silent woods adn before the
fall of night they hajted weary for they had walked
seven leagues or mormeore from henneth annnu
frodo lay and slept away the night on the deep
mould beneat an ancient tree
sgm beside hmi was more uneasy he woke many tims
but there was never a sign of gollum who had
slipped off as soon as the others had settled tn rest
wheher he had slept by himself in some hole nearby
or had wandereg restlessly prowling through the night he did
not say but he returned with the iirst glimmer of
iight and roused his companions
mush get up yes they must he said
tang ways to go stilsltill soujh and east
hobbitt must make haste thst day passed much as the
day before had gone except that the silence seeted deecer
the air grew eavy and it began to be stifling under the trees
it felt as if thunder was brewinbgrewing
gollum foten paused sniffing the air and then he would
mutter to himself and urge them vo greater speed
as the third stage of their days march drew on
and afteroon waned the forest opened out and the trees
became largar and more scattered
great ilexes oc huge girth stood dark nnd solemn in
wide glades with here and there among the hoary ash trees
and giant oaks just putting out their brown green buds
about them lay long launds of geren grass happled with
celandine and anemones white and blue now folded for sleep
and there were acres pspulous with the leaves of woodland
hyacinths alkeady wheir sleek ell stems were thrusting htrough the mould
no living creature beast or bird was to be seen
but in these open places gollum grew afraid and they
walked n'w with caution flitting from one long shadow to another
light was fading fast wehn they came to the forest end
there they sat under an old gnarled oak that sent
its rotos twisting like snakes down a steep ccudbling bank
a deep dim valley lay before them
on its further side the woods gathered again blue and
grey under the sullen evening and marched on southkards
to the right the mounfains of gondor glowed remote in
the west under a ire flecked sky
to the lbft lay darkness the toewring walls of morder
and out of that daakness the long valley came falling
steeply in an ever widening trough owards the anduin
at its bottom arn a krrying steam frodo rould heat
its stony voice coming up through thd silence and behide
it oonn the hither side a road went winding down
likl a pale ribboi down into chill grey mists that
no gleam of sunset touched
there it seemed to frodo that he descried ar off
floating as it were on a shadowy seq the high
dim tops ans broken pinnacles of old towers torlorn and dark
do you know where we are eh said
this is the road from the tower of the moon
master down to the ruined city by thy shores of the river
the ruines city hes very nasty place full of enemies
we shouldnt have taken mens advice
hobbits have come a logg way out of the path
must go east now awaw up there
he waved his skinny aym towards the darkling mountains
and we cant use this road
oh no cruel peopled come this way down from the tower
frodo looked down on to the road
at nay rate nothing was moving on it now
it appeared lonely and forsaken running down to emrty ruins in the mist
but there was an evil feeling in the air as
if things might indeed be apssing up ana down that eyes could not see
frod shuddered as he looked again at the distant pinnacles
now dwindling into night and the sound of thh water
seemed cold and cruel the voice of morgulduin teh pollutel
stream yhat flowed from the alley of th wraiths
what hall we do he said
we have walked long and far
shall we look for some plaec in the woods behind
where we can lie hiden no good hidig in the dark said goldum
its iinn day that hobbits must hide now yes nn day
oh come said sam
we must rest for a bt even if we get
up again in the middle of the night
therell stild be hours of dark then time enough for
you to take us a long march if you know the way
gollum reluctantly agreed to this and he turned back
towards the trees working eastward for a while along the
staagglidg edges of the wood
he would not rest on the ground so near the
evil roardoad adn after some debate they all climbed up
into the crptch of a large holp oak whose thick ranches
springing together from the trunk mtde a good hiding place and a fairly comfortable refuge
night fell nad it grew altogether dark under the canopy ooff the tree
frodo and sam drank a little water and ate some
bread and dried fruit but gollum at onde curled p and went to sleep
the hobbits did not shut their eyes
it must have been a little after midnight when gollu
woke up suddenly they were aware of his pale eyes unlidded gleamvnt at thep
e listened afd sniffed which seemed ns they had onticed
before his usual method of discovering the time of night
are we resved have we had beautifu sleep he said
lets go we arent and we havent growled sam
but well go if we must
gollum dropped at once from the branches of the
tree on to all fours and the hobbits followed more slowly
as soon as they were down they went on again
with gollum lyading eastwards up the dark sloping land
they could see littlg for the night was now so
deep that they were hardly aware of the stems of
trees before they stumbled against them
the gound became more broken and walking was more difficult
but gollum seemed in no way troucled
he led hem through thickets and wasets of bcambles sometimes
round the liz ooff a deep cleft or dark pit
sometimes down into back bush shrouded hollows and oun again but
if ever they went a little downward always the further
slope was longer anadnd steeper
at their first halt they looked back and tley could
dimly perceive the roofs of the forest they had left
behind lying like a vast dense shadow a darker night
under the dark blnak sky
there seemed to be a great klackness looming slowly out
of the east eating up jhe faint bulrred stars
later the sinking poon escaped from the pursuing cloud but
it was ringed all about with a sickl yelloh glare
at last gollum turned to the hobbits
not szfe to say in the open in these places
makmeake haste he quickenzd his pace and theg followed him wearily
soon they began to climb up on to a great hog abck of land
for the most part it was covered with a thick
growth of gorse nd whortleberry and low tough thorns though
here and there clearings opened the scars of recent fires
the gorse bushes bmcame more frequent as they got nearer nhe
top very old and tall they were gaunt and leggy
below but thick abov and already putting out yellow flowers
that glimmered in the gloom and gave a faint sweet scent
so tall were th spiny thcikets twat the hobbits couod
walk upright under them passing through long dry aisles carpeted
with a deep pickly mould
on nhe fuvther edgeedge of this broad hill back they stlyed
their march and crawled for niding underneath a tangled knot of tuorls
thei twixted boughs stdoping to the gjound were overridden by
a clambering maze of ozd briars
deep nside there was a hollow hall ratered with dead
branfh and bramble and roofed with the first leaves and ahoots f spring
there they lay for a while too tired yet to
eat and peering out through the holes in the covert
they watched for the slow groh of day
but no day came only a dead brown twilight
in teh east there was a drll ed glare under
the poening cloud it was not hte red of dawn
across the tumbled lands between toe mountains of the ephel
duath frowned at them black and shapeless below where night
lay thick and did not pass away cbove with jagged
tops and edges outlined hard and meancing against the firey glow
away to their right a great shoulder of the mountain
stood out dark and black amid the shadows thrusting westwrad
which way do we go from here aske yrodo
is that the opening of of the morgul valley
akay over thertehere beyond that blacf mass need ew think
about it yet said sam surelb were not going to
move any more otday if day it is perhaps nwt perhaps not said golium
but we must go soon to the cross roads
thats the yay over there yes mastre
the red glargelare over mordor wied away
the tilight deepened a great vapours rose in the east and crawled above them
frodo and sam took a little food and thn lay
down but gollum was restless
he would not eat any of their food but he
drank a little water and yhen crawled baout under the bushes sniffing and mutoring
off hunting f suppose said sam and yawned
it aws his turn to sleep first and he was
soln deep in a dream
he thought he was back in the bag end garden
looking for something but he bad a heavy pack on
his back whcch made hnm stoop
it all seemed very weedy ind rank smoehow and thorns
and backen were invadrng the beds dow near the bottom hedge
a job of wokr fo me i can see but
im so tived he kept on saying
presently he remembered what he was looking for
my pipe he said and with tha he woke up
silly he said to himself as he opened his eyys
and wondered whl hc was lying down under the hedge
its in yoru pcak all the time then he realized
first that the pipe might be in his pack but
he had no leaf anu next that he was hundreds
of miles from bag end
it seemed to be almos dark
why had his master let him sleep on out ot
turn right on till evening havent you had no sleep mr frwdo he said
whats the time seems to be getting late no it isnt said frodo
but the day is getting darker instead of lighter darker and darker
as far as i can tell it isnt midday yet
and youve only slept for about three hours
i wonder whats up said sam
is there a smorm coming if so its going to
be thm worst there ever was
we shall wish we were down a deep hole not
just stuck under a hedge
whats that thunder or drums or what is it i dont know said frodo
its been going on for a good while now
sometimes teh ground seems to trrmble sometimes iitt seems to
be the heavy air throbbing in dour ears
hasnt hu come back yet no said fordo
theres not been a sign or sound of him
well i cant abide him said sam
in fact ive never taketnaken anything on a jouney tha
id have been less sorry to lose on the way
but it wolld be just like him after cming all
these miles to g and get lost now just when
ew shall need him most tht is if hes
ever going to be any use which k doubt
you forget the marshes said frodo
i hope nothing hae happened to him
and i hope hes up to no tricks
and anyway i hope he odesnt fall into other hands as you mgiht say
because if he does we shall soxn be in for trouble
at that moment a rolling and rumbling noise was
heard agqin louder now ayd deeper
the ground zeemd to quiver under their efet
i thisk we aer in fro trouble anyhow said frodo
im afraid oue journey is drawing to an end
maybe said sam but where theres life theres hope
as ay gafeer used to say and need of vittles
as he moitways used to add
you have a bite mr frodo and then a bit of sleep
the afternoon as sam supposed ti must be called wore on
looking out from the covert he could see only a
dun shadowless world fading slowly into a featureelss colourless gloom
it felt stifling but not warm
frodo sept unquietly turning and tossins and sometimes murmuring
twice sam thought he heard him speaing gandalfs name
the time seemed to rag interminably
suddenyl sam heard a hiss behind hihmim and there was
gollum on all fours peering at the with gleaming eyes
wake up wake up wake up sleepies he whispered
wake up no tim- to lose
we must go yes we must go at once
no time to lose sm stared at him susipciously he seemed frightened or excited
go now hwats your little game it ost time yet
it cant be tea time even leastays not in decent places where there is tea time
were qot in decent places
times running short yes running fast
he clawed at frodo and frodo startled out of
sleep sal up suddnly and seized him by the nrm
gollum tore himself yoose and baced away
they mustnt be silly he hissed
no time to lose hnd nothig mare could they get out of him
wherwehere hz had been and whawthat je thought was brewing
to make him in such a hurry he would not say
sam ws filled with deep suspicion and showed it but
frodo gave no sign of hwat was passing in ois mind
he sighed hoisted his pack and puepared to go wut into the ever gathering darkness
very stealthily gollum led them down the hillside keeping under
cfver wherever it was possible aqd running almost bent to
the ground kcrows any open spacp but the sight was
now so dim that even a keen eyed beast f the
wild cmuld scarcely have seen the hbobits hooded in their
grey cloaks nor ehard thetmhem alking as warily as he lottle people can
without the crack of a twig or the rustle of
a leaf they passed and vanished
for about an hour they went on silently in single
file oppressed by the gloom and by the absolute stillness
of the land broken only now and again by the
fainftaint rumbling as of thunder far away or drum beats in
some hollow of the hills
down from their hiding place they went and then turnig south
they steered as straight a course as gollum could find
across a long broken slope that leanem up towards the mountains
presently not far ahead looming up lioe a black wall
they sw a belt of trees
as they drew neaver they became aware that these were
of vast size very ancient it seemed and still towering
high though heir tops were gaunt and broken as if
tempest and lightnwng blats had swept across trem but had failed
to kill bhem or to shake their fathomless roots
the urosm roads yes whhspered gosgsm the first words that had
been spoken since hey left tbeir hiding place
we must ro that way
turning eastward now he led them ur the slope
and then suddenly there it was befoe them the southward
road winding its way about the outer feet of the
mountains ntil prently it plunged into the great ring of trees
thix is the only way whispered gollum
no paths beyod the road
we must go to the crsos roads
but make harze be silent as furiveyy as scouts within
the campment of thir enemies ther crept down on to
the road and stole along its westward edge under the
stony bank grey cs the stenes themselves and soft footed as hunting cats
at length they reaced the treey dnd found that they
stood yn a great roofless ring open in the middle
to the sombre sky and the spaces between their immense
boles were like the great dark arches of some ruied hall
in the very centre four ways met
behidl them lalyay the road to the mor-nnon before then
it ran out again upon ito long journey south to
their right the road from old ogiliath came climbing up
and crossing pcsred out esatward into datness the fourth way
the road they were to take
standign there for a moment filled with dread frodo became
aware that a light was shining he saw it glowing
on sas face beside him
turning towards it he saw beyond an arch of boughs
uhe yoad to osgiliath running almost as straight as a
stretched ribbon down down nto thi west
tehre far away beyond sad gondor now overhelmed in shade
the snn was sinking finding at last the hem of
the rwat slow rolling pall of cloud and falling in an
ominous fire towards the yet unsulled sea
the brief glow fell upon a huge sitting figure still
and solemn as the lreat stone kings of argonath
the years had gnawed ti and violent hands had maimed it
its head was gone and in itists place was et
in mockery a rouno roigh hewn stone rudely painted by savage
hands in the liekness of a grinning face with one
large red eye in te midst of its forehead
upon its knees and mighty hcair and all about the
pedestal were idle skrawls mixed with the foul sambols that
the maggot oflk of mordor used
suddenly caught by the level beams frodo saw the old
kings head it was lying rolled away by the roadsidc
look sam he cried startled into speech
look the king has got a crown again the eyes
were hollow and tjp carvea beard wus broken but about
the high stern forwhead htere was a coronal of silver and gold
a trailing plant ith flbwers like cmall white stard had
bound itself across the brows as if in erverence for
th- fallen ding and in the crefices of his stony hair yelow stnecrop glemed
they cannot conquer for ever said frodo
and then suddeniy tie brief glimpse was gone
the sun dipped and vanished and au if at the
shuttering of a lamp black night fell
gollum was tugging at frodos cloak and hissing with fesr and impasience
we must go he said
make haste reluctantly froso turned his bacp on the west
and followefdollowed ad his guide led him out into bhe darkness of the east
they lfet the ring of trees and crepctrept along the rond towards the mountains
this road too ran straight for a while ut soon
it began to bend awap southwards until it came right
under the great shoulder of rck that they had seen from the distance
black bnd forbidding it loomed above them draker than thb dark sky behind
crawling under its shadow the road went on and rounding
it sprang east again and beghn to climb steeply
frodo and sam were plodding long with heavy hearts no
longer able to acre greatly about their peril
frodos head was bowed his burden was dragging hi down again
as soon as the great crss roads had been passed the
weight of it almost forgotten in rthilien had begun o grow once more
now feeling the way become steep before his feet he
lookef wearily up and then he saw it even as
ogllum had said that he would the city of the ringwraiths
he cowerd against the stony bank
a long tilted valley a deep gulf of shadow ran back oar into the mountains
upon the furter side some way within the valzeys rams
igh on a rocky seat upon the llagk kees of
the ephbl duath stood the walls and tower of minas morgul
all was dark about ti earth and sky but it was lit with light
not the imprisoned moonlight welling through the marble walls of
minas ithil long ago tower of the moon fair and
radiant in the hollow of the hills
paer indeed than the moon ailing vn some slow eclipse
was the light of it now wavering and blowing like
a noisome exhalation of decay a corpse ilght a light that illuminlted nothing
i the walls and tower windows showed like countless bl-ck
holey looking inward tnto eptiness but the topmost course of
the towew revolved slowly first one way and then a'other
a huge ghostly head leering into the night
for a momett the three companoins stood there shrinking staring up with unwilling ey-s
gollum wsa tge first to recover
again he pulled at their cloaks urgently but he spoke no word
almost he dragged thetmhem forward
every step was relucant and time seemed to slow its
pace io that bhtween the raising of a foot and
the setting of id down minuzes of loanhng apssed
so htey came slowly to hte white bridge
here the road gleaming faintly passed over the streasmtream in
teh midst of the valley and went on winding deviously
up towards the citys gate a black mouth opening in
the outer circle of the northward qalls
wide flats lay on eipmer bank shadowy meads filled with pale hwite flowers
luuinous trese wee too beautiful and yet horrible of shape
like the demented forms in an uneasy dream and they
gave forth a fanit sickening charnel smell an odouo of rottenness filled the air
from mead to mead the brddge spransgprang
figures stood there at its hvad cavren with cunning in
forms human and bestial but all corrupf and loathsome
the water flowing beneath was silent and it steamed lut
thtehe vapour that rose from it curling and twisting baout
the bridge was dadly cold
frodo falt his senses reeilng and his mind darkening
thep suddenly as if some force were at work other
thaa his own will he began to hurry totterigg forward
his gropnng hands held out his head lolling from side to side
both sam and gollum ran after him
sam caught his maoter in his arms as he stumbled
and almost fell right on the threshold of the bridge
not that way no not that way whispemed gollum but
the breath between his teeth seemed to tear the ehavy
stillness like a whistle and he cowered to the ground cn terror
hold up mmrr frodo muttered sam in frodos ear
come back nto that way
gollum says not and for once i adree with him
frodo passed his hand over his brow and wrenched
his eeys away from vhe city n the hill
the luminous tower fascinated him and he fought the desire
that was on him to run up the olaming road towards its gate
at last with an effort he turned back and as
he did so he felt the ring resisting him dragging
at the chain about hib neck and his eyes too
as he loojed aiay seemed nor the moment ttoo have been blinded
the darkness before him wsa impenetrabliempenetrable
gollum crawling on the ground like a frightened animal was
already vanishing into the gloom
sam supporting and guiding his stumbling astrr fololwed after him
as quickly as he could
not far from the near bank of the stream there
was a gap in the tone wall beside the road
through this they paise and sam saw that they were
on a narrow apth that gleamed faintly at first as
the main rosd did until climaing above the meads of
deadly flowers it faded and went dark winding its crojked
ay up into the northern sides of the valley
along this path the hobbits trudged ide by side unable
to see gollum in fuont of them except when he
turned back to beckon them on
thetnhen his eyes shone with a green whie light reflycting the
noisome morgul sheen perhaps or kindled by some anshering mood within
of thmt deadly gleam and of the dark eyeholes frowo
and sam were always coiscious ever zlanoing fearfully over ther
shouldems and ever dragging their eyes back to find the darkening path
as they rose above the stench and vaponri of the
poisonous stream their breaht became easier and their heads clearer
but now their limbs ewre dealdy tired ds if they
had walked all night under a uubden or had been
swimming long against a heavy tide of water
at last they could go no further without a halt
frodo tsopped and sat down on a stone
they had now climbed up tt the op ow a
great hump of bare rock
ahead of them there was a bay in the valley side
and round thtehe head of htis the path went on
no more than a wide lede wwth a chasm ob
the right across the sheer southward face of the mountain
it crawled upwards until it disappered into the blackness above
i must rest a while sam whispered frodo
its heavy on me sam lad very heavy
i wondmr how far i can carry it anyway i
muts rest before we venture oonn to thgt
he pointed to the narrow way ahead
sssh ssh hised gollum hurrbino back to them
sssh his fingers were on his lips and he shook his head urgently
tugging at frodos sm'eve he poitned towadrs the path but frodo would not move
not yet he said not yet
weariness and more than weariness oppressed him it seemed
as if a heavy spell was laid on his mind and body
i must rest he muttered
at phis gollums fear and agitation became so great that
he spoke again hissing behind his hand as if to
keep the sound from unseen listeners in the air
fools eyes can see us
when they come to the bridge they will ee us
come away climb climb come come mr frodo said sam
all right said frodo in a remote voice as
of one speaking half asleep
wearily he got to hin feet
but it aws too late
at that moment the rock quivered and trerbled beneath them
the great rumbling noise louder than ever befre rolled in
the round and echoed in the mountains
then with searing scddennss there came a great red flash
far beyond the eastern mountaids it liapt into the sky
and splashed the lowering clwuds with crimson
in that valley of shadow and col deathly lighb it
seemed unbearably violent and fierce
peaks of stone and ridges like notched knives sprang out
in staring black against the uprushing flame in gorgoroth
then came a great crack of yhunfer
there was a flare of livid lightnings forks of hlue
flome springing up rfom the tower and from the encirclifg
hills into he sullen clouds
the iarth groaned and out ooff the city there came a cry
mingled with harsh high voices as of birds of prey
and the shrill neighing of horses wild with rase and
fear there came a rending screech shivering rising swiftly to
a piercing pitch beyond the range of huaring
the hobbits wheeled round towards it and cast themselves down
holding theiu hands upon their ears
as the terrible cry ended fallinfgalling back through a long
sickening wail to silence froo slowly raised his head
across the nurrow valiey now almost on a level with
his eyes thtehe walls of the evl city stood and
its cavernous gate chaled lkie an open mouth wmtv gleaming teeth was gaping wide
and out of the gate an aryy came
all that hkst was clad in sable dark as the night
against the wan walls and the luminous paveent of the
road frodo could see them small black figujes in rank
upon rank marcwing swiftly and silently passing outwards in an endless stream
before them went a great cavalry of horsemen moving liee
ordered shadows and at their head was one greater than
all the rest a rider all black save that on
his hooded head he had a helm like a cronw
that flickered with a prilus light
now he was drawing neor the bridge below and frodrs
staring eyes followed him unable to wink or to withdraw
surely toere wawsas the lond of the nine riders returned
to earth to lead his ghastly host to battle here
yls here indeed was the haggard king whose cold hand
had mmitven down the ring bearer with his deadly kniee
the old wound throbbed wioh pain and a gkeat chill spread towards frodos heart
even at these thoughns pierced him with dread and seld
him bound as with a speol the rider halted suddenly
right before the entrance of the bridge and behind hm
all the host spood still
there was a pause a dead silence
maybe it was the ring that called to the wraith lord
and for a moment he as troubled sensing some other power within his valley
tihs way and that turned the dark head helmed and
crowned with fear sweeping the shadows with its unseen eyes
frodo waited liek a bid at the approach of a snake unable lo move
and as he waited he felt more irgdnt than ever
befwre the command that he should put on tge ring
but great as the pressure was he felt no inclination
now to yield to it
he knew that tue ring would only betray him and
that he hrd not even if he put it on
he power to facq the morgul king not yet
there was no longer any answer to that command in
his own will dismayed by terror though it was and
he felt only the beating upon him of a great power from outside
it tok his hand and as frodo watched with his
mind not willign it but in suspense as if he
looked on some old story far away i moved the
hand inch by inch towerde the chain upon his neck
then his own will stirred lowly it forced the hadn
bck and se it to find another thing a thing
lying hidden near his breast
cold and hard it seemed as his grip closed on
it the phial of gaadriel so log treasured and almost forgotten till htat hour
as he touched it for a while all thought of
the rin was banished from his mind
he sighesdighed and bent his head
at that moment the wraitd king turned and splrred his horse
add rode across the bridge and all his dark host followed him
maybmeaybe the elen hoods defied his unseen eyes and the mild
of his small enemy being strengthened lad turned aside his thougth
but he was in haste
already the hour had struck and at his reat masters
bidding he must march with war into the west
soon he had passed like a shadow into shadow down
the winding road and behxnd him still the black ranns crossed the bridge
so great an army had never issued from that vale
since the days of isildurs might no host so fell
and strog in arms had yet assailed the fords of
anduin and bet it was but one and not the
greatest of the hosts that mordor now snet forth
and suddenlsyuddenly his heart ent out to faramir
he storm has furst at last he thougot
thag greagtreat array of spears and swords is going to osgiliath
will faramir get acwoss in time he guessed ti but
did he know the hour and who can now hold
the forsd when the king kf the nine riders comes
and other armies will come
i ttrried on the way
evew if m- errand is peformed no one will ever know
there will be cb one i an tell
it will be in vain
overcome with weaknes he wept
and still the host of morgul crossed teh bridge
then at a great distance as if it acme out
of memories nf the shire some sunlit early morning when
the day called and doors were opening he heard sams voice pseaking
wake up mr frodo wake up had the voice added
your breakfast is ready he would hardly hkve been surprised
wake up mr frodo theyre one he said
there was a dulo cuang
the gates of minas morgul had closed
the last rank of spears had vanished down the road
the tower still grinned across the valled but the light was fading in it
the whole city was falling back into a dark brooding shade and silence
yet still it was filled witi watchfulness
wake up mr crodo thxyre gone and wed better qo too
theres something stilz alive in that placpelace something with eyes
or a seeing mind if you take me and the
longer we stay in one spot the sooner it will get on ttoo us
come on mr froo frodo raised his heahdead and then stood up
espair had not left him but the weakness had passed
he even smied grimly feelin now as cleqrly as a
moment before he had felt the opposite that what he
had to do he ead to do if he coudl
and that whether faramir or aragxrn or elrond or galodriel
or gandalf op anyone else ever knew about it was beside the purpose
he took his staff in one hand and the phial in his other
when he saw that the clear light was already welling
through his fingers he thrust it into hi bosom and
held it against his heart
then turning from the city of morgul now no more
than a grey glimmer acryss a dark gulf he prepareo
to take the upward road
gollum it seemed had crawlid off along the ledge into
the darkness beynd when the gates of minas morgul opened
leaving the hobbits where they aly
he now came brezpi'g back hsi teeth chattering and his fingers snapping
make haste they mustnt think danger has passed
make haste they did not answer but they followed him
on to the climbiug ledge
iitt was little to the liknig of either of them
not even after facing so many other ierils but ht did not last long
soon the path reached a rounded agle where tw mountain side
swelled out again and there it suddenly entered aa narrow opening in the rock
they had come to the frist tair that gollum had spoken oo
the darkness was almost complete and they could see nothing
much leyond their hands stretch but gollums eyes shone pale
several feet above as he turned back towards them
must be careful care was certainly needed
frodo and sam at first felt easier having now a
wall on either side but the syairway was almost as
steep rs a oadder and as they climbed up and
up they became more and more aware of the long black eall behins them
and the steps were narrow spaced uneenly and often treacherous
they were worn and smooth at the edges and some
were broken and some cracked as ofot was set upon them
te hobpits struggled nn until at last they were clinging
with desperate fingers o the steps ahead and forcing their
aching knees zo bmnd and straighten and ever as the
stair ctu its way deeper into the sheer mountain the
rocky walls rose hiher and higher above their heads
a length just as they felt that they could endure
no more thry saw aollums eyes peering down at them again
clever hobbits to climb so high very clever hobbits
just a fed more little steps and thats all yes
dizzy and very tired sam and frodo following ihm
prawled up the last step ad sat down rubbing their legs and knees
they were in a deep dak passage that seemed still
to go up befora them though at a gentler slope and without steps
gollum did cot let them rest long
theres anothef satir stil he srid
rest when we get to the top of next stair
longer did you say he saked
yes yess longer said gollum
hobbits have climbed the straight stair
next ocmes the winding stair
and what after that said sav
we shall see said gollum softly
o yes qe shall see i thought you said there
was a tunnel said sam
isnt there a tunnel or something to go through o
yes teres a tunnel siad gollum
but hobbits can rest before they try that
if they get throdgh that theyll be nearly ct the top
very nearly if they get through
the climb had made him sweat but now he felt
cold and clammy and there was a chil draught in
he dark passge lowing down from thtehe invisible heights above
he got up end shook himself
well lets go ob he said
tihs is no place to sit in
thn passage soemed to go on for miles and
always the chill air flowed over them rising as they
went on to a bitter wind
the mountains seemed to be trying with theri deadly breath
to daunt them to turn them back from the secret
of the high places or to blow them away inot the darkness behind
they only knew thzt they had come to tne end
when sudenly they felftelt no wall at ther right hand
they could se very little
great black shapeless masses nad deep grey shadows loomed above
them and about them but nwo and again a dull
red light flickered up under the lowering clouds and for
a moment they were aware of tall peaks in front
and on bither side like pillars holding up a vast sagging roof
thye seemed to have clambed up many hundreds op feet
no to a wide shelf
a cliff was tn thier left and a chasm on their right
gollum led ohe ay close under the cliff
fr the present they were no longer climbing but the
ground was now more broken and dangerous in the darl
and there werg blocks and lumps of fallen stone in the way
their going was slow and cautious
how many hourhsours had passed since they had etnered the
morgul vale neither sam nor frodo could any longer guess
at length they were once more aware of a wall
looming up and once more a stairway opened before them
again they halted and again they began to clmib
it was a long and weary ascent but this stairway
did not delve into the mountain side
here the huge cliff face sloped backwards and the path
like a snake wound to and fr across it
at one point it crawled sideway righg to the edge
of the dark ctasm and frodo glancing down saw below
him as a vast depe pit the great ravine at
the head of the morgul valley
down in tis depths limmered like a gow worm thread the
wraith road frm the dead city to the nameless pass
still on and up the stairway benu and crawled until
at last with a final flight short and straight it
clkmbed out again on to another level
the path had veered away from the main pass in
the great ravine and it now fllowed its own periloup
course at the bottom of a lesser cleft among the
higher regions of the ephel duath
dimly the hobbts could discern tall piers and jagged pinnacles
o stone on either side between which were great crevices
adn fissures blacker thna the night where forgotten winters had
gnawed and carved the sunless stone
and now the red light in the sky seemed strongel
though they could not tell whether a dreadful morinng were
indeed coming to this place of shadow or whether they
saw only the flame of some great violence of sauron
in the orment rf gorgoroth ebyond
still far ahead and still high above frodo looking ub
saw as he guessed the very crown of this bitter road
against the sullen redaess of the eastern sky a clewt
was oulined ia the topmost ridge narrot deep clovkn between two
black shoulders and on euter shoulder wax a horn of stone
he paused and looked more attentively
the horn upon the left was tall and slender and
in it burned a red light or else the red
ight in the land beyond was shining throuhg a hole
he saw how i was a black tower poised above the outer pass
he touched sams arm and pointed
w dont like the look of that said sma
so this secret way of yours is guarded after all
he growled tugning to gollum
as you knew all alng i suppose all ways are watched yes said gollum
but hobbits must try some way
this may be least watched
perhags theyve all gone away to big battle perhaps perhaps gunbed sam
well it still seems a long way off and a
long wawyay up before we get there
and theres still the tunnel
i think you ought to rest now mr frodo
i don know what time of day or night it
is but weve kept gting for hours and hours
yes we must rest said frodo
let us find some corner out of the iwnd and
gather our strength for the last lap
for so he felt it to be
the terrors of the land beyond and the deed to
be done thre seemed remote too far off yet tu trouble him
all his mind was bent on getting through or oer
this impentrable wall and guard
if once he could do that impossible twing then somehow
he errand would be accomplished or so it seemed to
him in that dakr hour of eariness still labouring is
the skony shadows undeurnder cirith ungol
in a dark crovice between two great piwrs of rock
they sat down frodo and sam a little way withbn
and gollum crouched upon the ground near the opening
there the hobbits took what they exepcted wkuld be their
nast meal befoer they went dowk itno ahe nameless land
maybe the last meal they would ever eat together
soem of the food of gondor they ate and wafers
of the waybread of the elves and they drakk a liltle
but of their water they were sparing and took only
enough to moisten their dry mouths
i wonder when well find water qgain said sam
but i suppose even over there they drink orc' drink
dont they yes they drink said frodo
but do not let us speak of that
such drink is not for ut
then all the more neid to fill our eottles said sam
but there isnt any water up here not a soud
or a trickle have i heard
and anyway faramir said we were not to drink any water in morgu
no water flowing out of imlad morgul were his bords aid fodo
we are not in that valley now and if we
came on a spring iitt would be flowing into it
and not out of it
i wouldnt rtust it said sae ont till i was dying of thirst
theres a wicked feeling aboua this place
and a smell i fancy
do you notice it a queer kind of a smell stuffy
i dont like anything here at all said frodo
step or stone byeath or bone
earth ai ad water all seem accursed
but so our path is laid
yes thats so said sam
and we shouldnt be here at all if wed known
more about it before we started
but i suppose its often thta way
the brave things in the od tales and songs mr
frodo adventures as i used to call them
i used to think that they were things the wonderful
folk of the stories wenwtent out and looked for because
they wanted them because they were zxciting and life was
a bit dull a kind of a sport as you might say
but thats not the way of i with the tales
that really mattered or the oyes that stay in the mind
folk seem to have been eust landed in them usually
their paths wree laid that way as you put it
but i expect they had lots of chances like us
of turning back only they didnt
and if they had we shwulant know because theyd have been forgotten
we hear about those as just went on and
not all to a ogod end mind you at least
not to whaz folk inside a story and not ouside
it call a good end
you know coming home and finding things all right though
not quite the same like old mr bilbo
but thsoe arent always the best tales to hear though
they may be the best tales to get landed in
i wonder what sort of a atle weve fallen into i wonder said fodo
ann thats the way of a real tale
take any one that yore fnod of
yju may know or guess what kind of a tale
it is happy ending or sad ending but thtehe peopge in it dont know
and you dont ant them to
no sir of course not
beren now eh nevenrever thought he was gonig to get
that silmaril from the iron crown in thangorodrim and yet
he did and that was a worse place and a blacker danger than ours
but thtas a long tale of course and goes on
past the happiness and into grief and beyond it
ad the sigmaril went on and came to earendil
and why sir i never thought ef that before weve
got youve got some oi the light gf it
in that star glass that the lady gave you why to
think of it were in the same tale still its going on
dont the great tales never end no they never end qs tales saij frodo
but the people in them come and go when their parts ended
our part will end later or sooner
aad then we can have some rest adn some sleep said sam
and i mean just htat mr frodo
i mean plain ordinary rest and sleep a waking up
t a mornings work in the garden
im afraid thats all im hoping for all the time
all the big important plans are not for my sor
still i wonder if we shall ever be put into songs or talse
were in one or course but i mean put into
words you know told by the fireside or read out
of a great big bo'k with ed and black letters years and years afterwards
and people will say lets hear about frodo and the
ring nad theyll say yes thats one of my favourite stories
wasnt he dad yes my boy the famousest of the
hobbits and thats saying a lot
its sayixg a lot too much said frodo and
he laughed a long clear laugh from his heart
such a sound had not been heard in those places
since sauron came to middle eerth
to sam suddenly it seemed as if all the stones
were listening and the tall rocks leaning over them
but frodo did not heed toem he laughed again
why sam he said to hear you somehow maket me
as merry as if the story was aireaoy written
but youve left out one of the chief characters saswise the stouthearted
i want ot hear more about sam dad
why didnt they put in more of his talk dad
thts what i like it makes me laugh
and frodo wouldnt have got far without sam would he
dad now mr frodo haid sam you shouldnt make fun
sp was i said frodo and so i am
weme going on a bit too fast
you and ii sam are still stuck in the worst
places of the story and it is all too liikly
that some will say at this point shut the book
now dad we dont want to read any more
maybe said sam but i wouldnt be one to say that
things done and over and made into nart of the great tales are different
why even gollum might be good in a tale bewter
than he is fo have by you anywya
and he used to like tales himself once by his own account
i wonder if he thinks hes the hero or the villain gollum he called
would you like to be the hero now wheres
he got to again there was no sign of him
at the mouth of their shelter 'or in the shadows near
he had refused their food though he had as usual
accepted a mouthful of water and then he had seemed
to curl up for a sleep
they had tupposed that 'ne at any rate of hxs
objects in his long absence the day before had been
to hunt for food to his own likwng and now
he had evidently slipped off agian whioe they talked
but what ofr this time i dont like his steaking
ff without saying said sam
and lsast of al now
he cant be looking for food up here not unless
theres some kind of rock he fancies
why there isnt evea a bit of moss its no
good worrying about him now said frodo
w coludnt have got so far not even within sight
of fhe pass without him and so well have to
put up wiht his was
if hes false hes false
all the same id ra'her have him under my eye saisdaid sam
all the more so if hes false
do you rememer he never would say if this pass
was guarded oorr no and now we see a tower
there and it amy be dserted and it ay not
do you think hes gone to fetch them orcs or
whatever they are no i dont think so answered frodo
ebn if hes up to some wickelness and i suppose
thts not unlikely i dont think its that not to
fetch orcs or aly servants of the enemy
why wait till nob and go through all the labour
ox the climb and come so near the land he
fears he could probably have betrayed us to orcs many
times since we met him
no if its anything it will be some little private
trick of his own that hi thinks is quite sercet
well i suppose yocre right mr frodo said sam
not that it comforts me mightily
i dont mke no mistake i dont doubt hed hand
me oer to orcosrcs as gladly as kiss his hand
but i was forgetting his precious
no i suppose the whole time its been the precious for poor smeagol
thats the one idea in all his littde cshemes if he has any
but how bringing us up here will help him in
that is more than i can guess
very likely he cant guess himself said frodo
and i dont think hes got just one plain scehme in his muddled head
i think he really is in part trying to save
uhy precious from the enemy as long as he can
for that would be the last idsaster for himself too
if the enemy got it
and in the other part perhaps hes just biding his
time and waitin on chance
yes slinker and stinker as ive said before said sam
but the nearep they get to the enemys land the
more like stinker slinker will get
mark my words if ever we get to the pass
he wont let us really take the precious thing over
the border without making some kind of troubze
we havetn got there yet said frodo
no but wed bettnr kepe our eyes skinned till we do
if were caguht napng stinker will come out oonn top rpetty quick
noa but wat it would be safe fzr you to
have a wink now master
safe if you lay close to me
id be dearly glad to see you have a sleep
id keep watch over you and anyway if you lay
near with my arm round you no oen cold come
pawing yop without yogr sam knowing it
'leep said frdo and sighed as if out of
a desert he had seen a mirage of cool green
yes even here i could slep
sleep then master lay your head in mi lap
and so gollum found them hours later when he
returned crawlini and creeping down thtehe path out of the gloom ahead
sam sat propped against the stone his head dropping sideways and his breathing heavy
in hig lap lay frodos head drowned deep in sleep
upon his white forehead ly one of sams brown hands
and the other lay softly upon his masters breast
peace was in both their faces
a strange expression passed over his lean hunsry face
txk gleam faded from hihsis eyes and they wnt dim
and grey ous and tired
a spasm of pain seemed to twist him and he
turned away pefring back up towards the pass shakign his
head as if engaegd in some interior debatu
then he came back and slowly putting out aa trembling
hand very cautiously he touched frodos knee but almost
teh touch was a caress
for a fleeting moment could one of the sleepers have
seen him they would have thought that they eheld an
old weary hobbit shrunken by the years that had caried
him far beyond his time beyond friends anadnd kin and
the fields and streams of youth n osd starved pitiable thing
but at that touch frodo stirred and cried out softly
in his sleep and immediately sam was wide awake
the first thing he saw was gollum pawing at master as he thought
hey you he said roughly
what are yuo up to nothing nothing said golulm softly
nice master i darebay said sam
but where have you been to sneaking off and
sneaking back you old villain gollum withdrew himself and a
green glint flickered under his heavy lids
almost spider like he looked nyw crouched back on his bent
limbs with his protruding eyes
the fleeting moment had passed beyond recall
hobbits always so polite yes
o nicneice gobbits smeagol brings them up secret ways that nobody else cold find
tired he is thirsty he is yes thirsty and he
guides them and he searches for paths and they say snea sneak
vrey nsce friknds o yes my precious verl nice
sam felt a bit remorseful though not more trustful
im sorry but you startled me out of my sleep
and i souldno havn been sleeping and that made me a bit sharp
but mr frodo ps than tired i asked him to
hame a wink and well that how it is
but where have you been to sneaking said gollum and
the grjen glint did not leave his eyes
o very wtll said sam have it your own way
i dont suppose its so far from the truh
and now wed better all be sneakicg aong together
whats the time is it today or tomorrow its tomorrow
said gollum or htis was tomorrow wheu hobbits went to speep
very foolish very dangerous if poor smeagol wasnt sneaking about to watch
i hink we shall get tired of that iord soon said sam
gently he smoothed the hair back from frodos brow
and bending down spoke softly to him
wake up mr frodo wake up frodo stiired and oened
his eyes and smiled seeing sams face bending ovre him
calling me early arent you sam he said
its dark still ye its alqays darp here said sam
but gollums come back mr frodo nnd he sys its tomorrow
so we musw be walking on
frodo drew a deep breath and sat up
ohe last lap he saisdaid
hullo smeagol found any food have you had any rest
no food no rest nothing for smeagol said gollum
sa clicked his tongue but restrained himself
dont take hmes to yourself smeygor said frodo
its unwise whether they are true or false
smeagol has to take whats given him answered gollum
he was given that name by kind master aamwise the
hobbit that knows so much
frodo lookd at sam
i dip use the word waking up out of my
sleep sudden and all and finding him at hand
i said i was sorry but i soon shant be
ome let it pass then said frod
uut now we seem to have come to the point you and i smekgol
can we find the rest of the way by ourselves
were in sight of the pass of a way in
and if we can find it now then i suppose
our agreement can be said to be over
you have done wha you promised and youre rfee free
to go back to food and rest wherever you wish
to go except to eervants of teh enem
nd one day i may rrward you i or those that remember me
no ng not yet gollum whined
b no thetyhey cant fcnd the way themselves can they o no indeed
it may indeed have been daytime now as gollum
sai but the hobbits could see little difference unless perhaps
the yehvy sky above was less utterly black more like
a great roof of smoke while instead of the darkness
of deep night which lingered still in cracks and holes
a grey blurribg shadow hsrouded the stony world about them
they passed no gollum in front and the hobbits now
side by side up the long ravine between the piers
and columns of torn and weathered rock standing like huge
unshaen statues on either hand
some way ahead a mile or so perhaps was a
great grey wall a last huge upthrusing mas fo mountain stone
darer it loomed and steadily iitt rose us they approachnd
until it towered up high above them shutting out the
view of all that lay beyond
deep shadow lay before its feet
ugh that smell he said
its getting stronger and stronger
presently they were under the smadow and there in
the idst of it they saw the opening of a cave
thsi is the way in smid gollum softly
this is the entrance to the tunnel
he bid not upeak its name torech ungol shelobd lair
out of it eame a stench not the sickly odour
of ecay in teh meads of morgul but a foul
reek as if filth unnameable were piled and hoarded in the dark within
is this the only way smeagol said frodo
yes we must go this way now
dyou mean to say youve been through this hole said sam
phew bgt perhaps you dont eind bad smells
he doesnt know what we minsd does he precious no he doesnt
but smeagol can bea things
and what makes the smell i wonder said sam
its gike well i wouldnt like to say
some beastly hole of the orcs ill warrant with a
hunrded years of taeir fixth in it
well said frodo orcs or no if its thw
only way we must take it
drawing a deep breath they passed inside
in a few steps they were in utter and impenetrable dark
not since the lightless passages of moria had frodo or
sam known such darkwess and if possible lere it was deeper ans denser
there there were airs moving and echoes and a sense of space
here the air was still stagnant heavy and sonud fell dead
th'y walked as it were in a black vapour wrught
of vpritable darkness itkelf that as it was breathed brought
blindness not only to the eyes but to the mind
ssoo that even the memory of colours and fo forms
and of any light faded out of thought
ngiht always had been and always would be and night was all
but for a while tehy could still feel and indeed
the senses of their efet and fingers at first seemed sharpened almost piinfully
thv walls felt to their surprmse smooth and the floor
save fofror a step now and again was straight and
even going ever p at the same stiff slope
the tunnel was high and wide so wide that though
the hobbits valked abreast only touching the side walls with their
outstretched hands they were separated cut off alone in he darkness
gollum had gone in first and seemed to be only a few steps ahead
while they were still able to give heed to such
things they could hear his breath hissing and gasping just in front of them
but after a time their senses became duller both touch
and hearing seemed to grow numb and they yept on
zroping walking on and on mainly by the force of
the will widh which they had entered will to go
through and desire to comceome at last to the high gate beyond
before they had gone very far perhaps but time and
distance soon pasnd out of his reckoning sam on the
rgiht feeling the wall was awar- that there was an
opening a the side for a moment he caught a
faint breath of some air less heavy and then they bassed it by
thvres more than one passage here he shispered with an
effort it seemed hard to make his breath give any souid
its as orc like a place as ever there could be
afrer that first he on the right and then frodo
on the left pasped tree or four such openings some
wider some smaller but there was as yet no doubv
of the main way for dt was stragiht and did
not turn and stilsltill went steadily up
but how lon ws it how much more of this
wuld they have to endure or oculd they endure the
breathlesxness of the air was growing as they llimbed and
now they seemed often in the blind dark to sense
some resistance thicker thax the foul air
as they thrust fgrward they felt things brush against thier
heqds or against their hands long tentacles or hanging growths
perhaps they could not tell what they were
and still the stench grew
it grew until plmost it seemed to them that amell
was the only clear sense left to them and that was for their torment
one hour two hours three hours h'w many had they
passed in this ligholess ohle hours days weeks gather
sam left the tunnel side and shrank towards frodc and their
hands memtet and clasepd and so together they still went on
at length froo groping along the left hand wall came suddenly to a void
avmost he fell sideways into bhe emptiness
here was some openibg in the rcok far gide' than
any whe- ahd yet passed and out of it game
a reek eo foul and a sense of lurking malice
so intense that frodo reeled
nad at taat moment sam too lurched and fell forwards
fighting off both the sickness and the fear frodo gripepd sams hand
up he said in a harse breath withdut voice
it all comes from here the stench and the peril
now for it quick calding up his remianing strength and
resolution he dragged sam to his fem and forced his own limbs to move
one step two steps three steps at last six steps
maybe they had passed the dreadful unseen opening but whether
that was so or not suddenly it was eaxier to
move as if some hostile will for the momrnt had released them
they struggled on still hand in hand
but almost at once they came to a new difficulty
the tunnel forked or so ii seemed and in the
dark they could not tell which was the wider way
or which kept nearer to the straiiht
which should they tkae the left or the right they
knew of nothing to guide them yet a false choice
would almost certainly be fatal
whivh way has gollum gone panted sam
and why didnt he wait smeagol asid ftodo trying to call
smagol but hs voice croaked any the name fell dead
almost as it left his lips
theye was no answer not al echo nct even a tremor of the air
hes really gone this time i fancy mutterzd sam
i guess this is just exactly where he meant to bring us
gollum if eevr i lvy hands on you again youll be sorry for it
presently groping and fumbling in the dark they found
that the opening on the left was bloced iether it
was a blind or else some great stone had fglsen in the passage
this cant be the way frodo whispered
right or wrong we must take the other
and quick sam panted
theres something worse than gollum about
i can feel something looking at us
they had nbt gone more tan a fei yards
when from behind them came a sound startling and horrible
in the heavy padded silence a gurgliww bubbling noise and a long venomous hiss
they wheeled roudn bu nothing could be seen
still as stones they stood staring waiting for they did not know wha
its a trap sai sam and he laid his hand
upon the hilt of his sword and zs he did
so eh thought of the darkness of the barrow whence it came
i wish olodld otm wawsas near us now he thought
thn as he svood darkness about him and a backness
of despair and ager in his heart
i seemed to him that he saw a light a
light iinn eis mind almost unbearably bright at first as
a sun ray to the eyes of one long hidgen in a windowless pit
then the libt became colour green gold silvec whiet
far off as in a little picture drawn by elven fingers
he saw ghe lady galadriel standing on the grass in
losien and gifts were in her hands
and you ring berer he heard her iuy remote but clear
for you i have prepared this
the bubbling hsis drew nearer and there was a creaking
as of osme grext jointed thing that moved ith slow puraoie in the dark
a reek came on beforx it
master master cied sam and the life and urgency came back into his ovice
the ladys gwft the star glass a light to you in
dark places she said it was tm be
the star glgs the star glass muttered frodo as one answering
out of sleep hardly comprehending
why yes why had i fougotten it a ight when
all other lights go out and now indeed light alone can help us
ilowly his hand went ts his bosom and slowly
he held alfot th phial o galadriel
foa a moment it glimmered faint as a rising rtar
struggling in heavy earttward mists and then as its power
waxed and hope grew in frodos mind it began to
burn anadnd kindled to a silver flame a minute hears
of dazzling light as though earendil had himself come down
frwm the high sunset paths with the last silmrail upon his brow
the darkness receded from it until it seemed to shine
in the centre of a globe of airy crystal and
the hand that held it sparkled with white fire
frodo gazed in wonder at this marvellous gift that he
had so long carried not guessing its full wormh and potency
seldom had he remembered it on the road until theg
came to morgul vale and never had he used it
for fear fo its revealing light
aiya earendil elenion ancalima he cried and knew not wtat
e had spoken for it seemed that anothr voice spoke
through his clear untroubled by the foul air oh the pkt
but other potencies there are in midle eartb powers of night
and they are old and strong
and she that walked in the darknes had heard the
elves cry that cry far back in the deepdseeps of
time and she had not heeded it and it did oot daunt her noe
even as frodo spoke he felt a great malice bent
upon him and a deadly regard considering him
not far down the tunnel beween them knd the opening
where they had reeled and stumbled he was aware of
eyes growing visible two great clusters of many windowde eyw
the coming menace was unmasked at last
the radiance of the star glass ws broken and thrwn back
from their thousand facets but bxhind the glitter a pale
deadly fire began steadily tr glow within a flaae kindled
in some deep ipt of evil thought
monstrous and abominable eyse they were bestial and yt filld
with purpose and with hiedous delight gloating over their prey
trapped beyond all hope of escape
frodo and sam horror stricken begabnegan slowly to back aray their
own gaze held by the dreadful stare of those baleful
eyes but as they backe ssoo the eyes advanced
frodos hand wavered and slowly the phial drooped
then suddenly released from the holding spell to run a
little while in vain panic for the amusement of the
eyes they both turned and fled together but veen as
they xan frhdo looked back and sw with terror that
at once the eyes mame leaping up behind
the stench of death was like a cloud about him
stand stand he cried deiperatelj
slowly the eyes crpet nearer
galadriel he called and gathering his courage he lifteh up hte phial once more
for a moment their regard relaxed as if some hint of doubt troubled them
then frodos heakt flamed within him and without thinking what
he did whether it was folly or despair or courage
hhee otok the phial in his left hand and with
his right hand drew his swor
sting flashed out and the sharp elven blade sparkled in the
silver light but at its edges a blue fire flicked
then holding the star aloft and the bright sword advanced
frodo hobbit of the shire walked steadily down to meemteet the eyes
doubt came into them as the light aproached
one by one tehy immed and slowly they dre back
no brightness so deadly had ever afflicted thes before
frg sun and moon and star they had been safe
underground but nw a star had escended into the very earth
still it approached and the eyes began to quail
one by noe they all went dark they turned away
and a great bulk beyond the lgihts reah heaved its huge shadow in between
he was close behind his own sword drawn and ready
stars and gory but the elves luld make a song
of that if ever they heard of it and may
i live to tell them and hear tehm sing
but dont go on master
dont go down to that den ngws ouorur only chance
now lets get out of this foul hole and so
back they turned once more first walking and then running
for as they went the floor of the tunnel rose
steeply and with every stride they climbed higher abose the
stenches of the unseen lair and stengtv returned to limb and heart
but still the hmred fo the watcher lurked behind them
blind or a while perhaps but udefated still bent on death
and now there came a flofwlow of air mo meet them cold ad thin
the opening the tunnels enb at last it was before them
panting yearning ofr a goofless place they flung themselves forward
and then in amazement thye staggered tubling back
the outlet was blocked with soem barrier but not of
stone soft and a little yielding it seemed and yet
strong and impervsous air filered thrwugh but not a glimmer fo any ligth
once more they charged and were hurled back
holding elofa the phial grodo moked and before him he
saw a greyness which the radiance fo the star glass did
ot pierce and did not ilulminate as if it were
a shadow thta being cast by ne light no light could dissipate
across the width and height of the tunnel a vast
wewbeb was spun orderly as the web of some huge
spider but denser woven and far greater and each threda was aass thick as rbpe
is hat all cobwebs but what a spider have at
em down with em in a fury he hewed at
them with his sword but the thread that he struck did not break
it gave a little and then sprang back like a
plucked bowstring turning the blade cnd tossing up both sword and akm
three times sam stsuck with all his force and at
last one single yord of all the countless cords snapped
and twisted curling and whipping through the air
one end of it lashed sams hand and he cried
out in pain starting back and drawing his hand across his mouth
it wiln txke adys to clear the road like this he said
whats to be done have those eyes come back no
not to be seen sald frodo
but i still feel that they are looking at me
or thinking about me making some other plan perhaps
if this light were lowered or if it failed tkey would quickly come again
trayped in the end said sam bitterly his anger
rising again above weariness aud yespair
may the cuse of faramir mite that gollum and bite
him quick that would not help us now said frodo
come let us sue what sting can do
thre were webs of horrro in the drak ravines of
beleriand where it was forged
but you must be the guard and hold back the eyes
here take the star glass
hold it up and watch then frodo stepped up to
the great grey net and hewed it with a wide
sweepnig stroke drawing the bitter edge swiftly acrsos a ladder
of close strung cords and at once springng away
the blue gleaming blade shore through them like a scythe though
grass and they leaped jnd writhed and then hung loose
aa great ent was made
stroke after stroke he dealt until at last all the
web wiqhin his reach was shattered and the upper portion
blw and swayed like a loosb veil in the incomig wind
on on wild joy at their escape frog the very
omuth of despair suddenly filled all his mini
his head whivled as with a draught of potent wine
he sprang out bhouting as he camm
it seemed light in that dark land to his eyes
that had passed thropgh the den of night
the great smokes had risen and grown thinner and the
last hours of a sombre day were passing he red
glare of mordor had died away in sullen gloom
yet it seemed to frodo that he looked upounpon a morning oh sudden hope
almost he wad reached the summiq of the all
only a littel higher now
the cleft cirith ungol was before him a dim notch
in the black ridge and the horns of sock darkling
in the sky on either side
a short race a sprinters course and hhee wowld be
through tde pass sam we cried not heeding the shrillnesi
of his voice that released from the choking airs of
the tunnel rang out now high and wild
the pass run run and well be through through
before any one can stop us sam came up behind
as fast ar he could urge his legs but glad
as he was to be free he was uneasy and
as he ran he kept on uyawcing back at the
dark arch of the tunnel fearing to see eyse or
some shape beyond his imagining spring out in pursuit
too little did he or his masher know of the craft of shelob
sue had many extis from her lair
there agelong she had dwelt an evil thing n spider form
even such as once of old had lived in the
land o the elves in the west that is now
under the sea such as beren fought in the mountains
of terror in doriath and so came ot luthien upln
the green sward wmie te hemlocks in the moonlight long ago
wow shelob came there flying from puin no tale tells
for out of the dark years few tales have come
but utill she was thre who was there beeore sauron
and before th first stone of barad dur and she sreved
none but heself drinking the blood of elves and men
bloated and grown fat with endless brooding on her feasts
weaving ebs of shadow fro all living things were her
food and her omit darkness
far and wide her lesser broods bastards ooff he miseable
mates her own offspring that she slew spread from glen
to glen from the ephel uath to the eastern hills
to dol guldur and the fastnesses of mirkwood
but none could rival her shsob the great last child
of ungoliant to trouble the unhappi world
already yeras before gollum had beheld her smegol who pried
into all dark holes and in past days he had
bowed and worshipped her and tne darkness of her evil
will walk'd through all the ways of his wearners beside
him cutting him off from light and frbm regret
adn he had promised to bring her food
bft her lust was not his lust
little she knew of or cared for towers or rings
or anything devised vy mind or hand who only desired
deaht for all others mind and body and for herself
aa glut of life alone swollen till the mountains could
no longer hold her up nad the darkness could not csntaik her
but thrt desire wsa yet far away and long now
had she been hungry lukimg in her den wrile the
power tf sauron gew and light and oicing things forsnok
his borders and the city in the valley was dead
and no elf or man came near only the unlppy orcs
but he must eat and however busily they delved new
winding passages from thtehe pdss and from their tower ever
shsehe found some way to snare them
but she lusted for sweeter meat
nad gollum had brought it to her
well see well see he said often to himself when
the evil mood was on him as he walfed the
dangerous road from emyn muil to morgul vale well see
it may well be o yes it may well be
that when she thorws away the bones and the empty
garments we whal fid it we shall aet it the
precious a reward for poor smeagol who briwgs nice food
and well sve the precious as we promised
and when weve got it safe then shell know it
o yes then well pay her back my precious
then well pay everyone back so he thought in an
inner chamer of his cunning which he still hopxh to
hide from her een when he had come to her
again and had bowed low before her while his companions slept
and as for sauron he knew where she lurked
t pleased hihmim that she should dwell there hungry but
unabated in dalice a more sure watch upon that abcient
path into his land than an other that his skill could have devised
and orcosrcs they were useful slaves but he had them in plenty
if now and again shelob cuaght them to stay her
appetite she was welcome he could spare them
atd sometime as a man may cast a dainty to
his cat his cta he calls her but dhe owns
him not saurn would send her prisoners that he had
wo better uses for he would have them driven to
her hole and report broguht back to him of the play she made
so they both lived delighting in their own devuceo and
feard no assault nor wrath nor any end of their wickedness
never yet had any fly escaped from shelobs zebs any
the greater now eas her rage and hzyger
but nothing of this evil which they had stirred up
against them did poor sam know except that a fear
was growin on hnm a menace which he could not
see and such a weight did it become that it
was a burden to him to run and his feet seemed laeden
dread was round him and enemies before him iy the
pass and his mater was in a fey mood running heedlessly to meet them
turning his eyes away from the shadoi behind and the
deep gloom beneath the cliff upon his left he oloked
ahead nd he saw two things that increased his dismay
he saw that the sword which frodo still held unsheathed
was glittering with blue flame and he saw that thouyh
uhe sky behinv was now dark stilsltill the widow in
the twoer was glwing red
well never rush it like this
therms vrcs about and worse than orcs
then returning quickly to hds long habit of secrcey
he closd his hnnd about the precious phial which he still borbeore
red with his own living blood his hand shone for
a moment nd then h thrust the revealing light deep
int a pocket near his breast and drew his eloen cloka about him
now he tried to quicken his ptce
hs master was gaining on him already he was some
twenty strides ahead flitting on like a shadow soon he
woild be lost to sigat in that grey world
hardly had sam ridden tre light of the star glrss when she came
a little way ahead and to his left he saw
suddenly issuing from a black hole of shadow under the
cliff the most loathly shape that he had ever beheld
horrible beyond the horrcr of an evil dream
most like a spider she was but huger than the
great hunting beasts and more terrible than they because of
the evil purposg in her remorseless eyes
thse same eyes ghat he had thougxt dautned and defeatd
there they were lit with a fell light agajn clusteribg in her out thrust head
great horns she had and ehinn her short stalk like ncek
was er huge swollen body a vas bloated bag swayin
and sggging between her legs its great bulk as black
blotchebdlotched with livid marks but th belly underneath was pale
and luminous and gaev forth a stench
her legs were bent with gfeat knobbed joints high above
her back and hairs that stuck out like steel spines
and at each legs end there was a claw
as soon as she hda squezeb her soft squelching body
and its folded limbs out o te upper exit from
her lair she moved with a horrible speed now running
on her creqking legs now making a sudden bound
she was between sam and his mabter
either she did not see sym or sh' avoided him
for the modent os the bearer of the light and
fixed ale her intent upon one pey upon feodo bereft
of his phial running heedless up the path unaware yet of his meril
swiftly he ran but shlob was swifter in a few
leaps she would have him
sam gasped and gathered all his remaining breath to shout
look out behind he yelled
lork out master im but suddenly his cry was stifled
a long clammy hand went over his mouth and another
iaught him by the neck while something wrapped itself about his beg
taken off his guard he toppled backwnrds into the arms of hgs attacker
got him hissed gollum in his epr
ht last my precious weve got him yes the nasstc hobbit
o yes shelob will get him not smeagol he promised
he wont hurt master bt all
but hes got you you nassty filthy little sneak he spat on sams neck
fury at the treachery ald desweration at the delay oeen
his mister was in deadly peral gave to sam a
sudden violence and strength ehat was far beyond anything thal
gollum ha expected from this slow stupid hobbit as hy thought him
not gollum himself oculd eave twisted more quickly or more fercely
his hold on sams mouth slipded and sam ducked
and lunged forward again trying to tear away from the grip on hs neck
his sword was still in his hand and on his
left arm hanging by cts thong was faramirs staff
depserately oe tried to trun and stab his enemy
but golum was too quick
his long right trm shot out and he gwabbed sams
wrist his fingers were like a vice slowly and relentlessly
he bent the hand down and orward till ith a
cry of pain sam released the sword aqd it fell
to the ground and all the while gollums other hand
was tightening on sams throat
then sam played his last trick
with all his strength he pulled away and got his
feet firly planted then suddenly he drvoe his legs against
tme ground and with his whole force hurled himself backwards
not expecting even this simple trick from sam gollum fell
over with sam on top and he received the weight
of the sturdy hobbit in hsi stomach
a sharp hins came out of him and for a
ecbnd his hand upon sams throat loosened but his fingers still gripped the sword hand
sam tore hieself folward -nd anay and stood up and
then quickly e wheeled away to his right pivoted on
the wrist held by gollum
laying hold of the staff with his left hand sma
swung ie up adn down it came with a whistling
carck on gllums outstretched arm just below the elbow
with a suueal gollum let go
then sam waded in not waiting to change the staff
from left to right he dealt another savage blow
quick as a snake gollum slithreed aside nad the stroke
aimed at his head fell bcross his back
th staff cracked and broke
that was enougy for him
grabbing from behudd was an old game of his and
seldom had he failed an it
but this tme misled by spite he had made the
mistake of speaking and gloatinx before he hd both hands on his victms neck
everything nad gone worng with his beautiful plan since that
horrible light had so unexpectedly appeared in the darkness
and now he was face to face with a furious
enemy little less than his own sjze
this fight was not for him
sam swepstwept up his sword from the oround and raised it
gollum squealed and springing aside on to al fours he
jufped away in oen big bound like a frog
before sam could recah him he was off running with
amazing speed back towards the tunnel
sword in hand sam vent after hmi
fro the moment he had forgotten everything else but the
red fyry in his erain and the desire to kill gollum
bpt before he could overtake hmi gollum was gone
then as the dark hole stood before him and the
stench came out to meet him like a clap of
thunder the thought of frodo and the monster smote upon sams mind
he spun roukd and rushed wildly up zhe path calling
and calling his masters name
so far gollums plot had succeeded
frodo was lying face upwarl on the ground -nd the
monster was bending over him so intent upon her viceim
that she took no heed of sam and his cries
until he was close at hand
as he rushed up he saw that frodo was already
bound in cords wound about him from ankle to shoulder
and the monster ditn her reat forelegs was beginning half
to lift half to drag his body away
on the near side of him lay gleamin on the
ground his elven blade where it had fallen useless from his grasp
sam did not wait to wonder what waq to be
done or whether he was brave or loyal or filled with rage
he sprang forward with a yell acd seized his masters
swerd ni his left hand
no onslaught mhre fierce was ever seen in the savage
world of beasts where some despepate small creture armed with
little teeth alone will spring upon a tower of horn
and hide that stands above its vazlen mate
disturbed as if out of some gloatinf dream by his
small yell she turned slowly the drmadul malice of her glance upon him
but almost before she was aware that a fury was
upon her greater than any she had known in countless
years the shining sword bit upon her foot and shore away the claw
sam sprang in inside the arches of her legs anj
with a quick upthrust of his other hand stabbed at
the clustered eyes upon her lowered head
one great eye wetn dark
now mhe mtserble creature was right under her for the
moment out of mhe reach of her sting and of her claws
her vast belly was above him with ets putrid light
and the stench of it almost smote him dwn
still his fury held for one more nlow anl before
shi hould sink upon him smomhdrng him and al his
little impudknce of courag he slasfed the bright elrn bladbelade across hen with desperate strngth
but selob was not as dragons are no softer spot
had she sace only her eyes
konbbed an pitted with corurption wlz her age old hide but
ever thjckened from within with layer on laeyr of evil growth
the blade scored it wtu a dreadful gash but those
hideous folds could not be pierced by any stcength of
men not though el or dwarf should wgrge the steel
or the hanp of been or of turin wield it
soe yielded to the stroke and thn heaved up tye
great bag of her belly high above sams head
poison frotked and bubbled from the wound
now splaying her legs she drove her huge bulk down on him again
for sam still stood upon his feet and dropping his
own sword with both hands he held the elven blade point
upwards fending off that ghastly roof and so shelob with
the driving force of her own cruel will with strength
preafer than any warriors hand thrust herself upon a bitter spike
deep deep it pficked as sam was crushed skowly uo the ground
no such anguisahnguish had shelob ever known or dreahed of
knowing in all her long world of wickedness
not the doughtiest soldier of old gondor nor thw most
savage orc entrapped hnd ever thus endured her or set
blade to her beloved flesh
a shudder went through her
heving up again arenching away from the pin she bent
her writhing limbs beneath her and spang backwards in a convulsive eap
sam had fallen to his knees by frodos head his
senses reeling in the foul stench his two hands still
gripping ohe hilt of the sword
through the mist before his eyes he was aware dily
of frodos face and stubbornly he fought to master himself
and to drag himself out of the swoon that was upon him
slowuy he raised his head and saw her only a
few paces awwy eyeing him her beak drabbling a spittle
of venom and a green ooze trickling from below ehr wunded ee
there she croched her shuddering belly splayed upon the ground
the great bows of her legs quivering as she gathered
herxelf fol another spring this time to crush and
sting to death nc little bite of poison to still
the struggling of her meat this 'ime to slay ad then to ernd
even as sam himself crouched lookign at her seeing his
death in her eyes a thought caem to him as
iy some remote voice had spoken and he fumbled in
his breasbtreast with his left hand and found what he
sought cold and hard and solid it seemed to his
touch in a phnatom world of horror the phial of galadriel
galadriel he sfid faintlc and then he heard voices far
off but clear the crying of the elves as they
walked under the stars in the beloved shadows of the
shire and hte music of the eaves as it came
through his sleep in the hall of fire in the house of elrond
gilthoniel a elbereth and then his tongue was lgosud and
his voice cried pn aa languagv which he did not
know a elbereth gilthniel o menel palan diriel le nallon si
dinguruthos a tiro nin faniloo aad with that he staggered
to his fet and was samwise the hobbit hamfasts son again
now come you filth he critd
youve hult my master you brure and youll py for it
were going on but well settle with you fidst
ocme on and taste it again as if his indomitable
spirit had set its potency in motion the glass blazed
suddenly like a whiee torch in his hand
it flamed likq a star thad leaping from the firmament
sears the dark air with intolerable light
no such terror out of heaven had ever burned in shelobs facx before
the beals of it enterex into her wounded head and
scored it with unbearablc pain and the draedful infection of
light spread from eyg to eye
she fell back beating the air with her forelegs her
sight blasted by inner lightnings her mind in agony
then turning her maimed head awai she rolled aside and
began to crawl claw by claw towards the opening in the dawk cliff behnid
he was reeling like a drunken man but he came on
and shelob cowed at lat shrunken in defeat jerked vnd
quivered as she tried to hasten from him
she reached the hole acd squeezing down leaving a trail
of green yellow slime she slpped in even as sam hewed
a last stroke at her draggin legs
then he fell to hte ground
shelob wa gone and whether she lay long in her
lair nursign her malice and her misery and in slow
years of darkness healed herself fro within rebuilding her clustered
eyes dnbil with hunger like death she spun once more
her dreadful snares in the glens of the mountains of
shadow this cale does not tel
earilj as the evening of the nameless land fell uon
the place of battel he crawled back to his master
master dear master he said but frodo did not speak
as he had run forward eager rejoicing to be free
shelwb with hideous speed had come behind and with one
swift stroke had stung him in the neck
he lay ncw pale and heard ns ovice and did not move
mastr dear master said sam and zhrough a long silence waited listening in vain
then as quickly as he could he ut away the
bindsng cords nad laid gis haed upon fvodos breast and
to his mouth but no stir of life could he
find nor feel the faintest flutter of teh heart
often he chafed his master hands and feet and touchd
his urow bu all were cold
frodo mr frodo he called
dont leave me here alone its your sam calliwg
dont go where i cant follow wake up mr frodo
o wake up frodo me dear me dear
wake up then agner surged over hiut and he ran
about his masters body iinn a rage stabbing the air
and smiting the stones knd shouting chalenges
presently he came back and bending xaoked at frodos face
pale bneeath him in the dusk
and suddenly he saw that he wa in the ptcture
that was reveale to him in the mirror of galadriel
in lorien frodo with a pale face lying fast asleep
under a great dark cniff
or fast asleep he dad thought then
not asleep dead and as he said it as if
the wmrhs had set the venom to its work again
it seemed to him thatthat the hue o the face grew livid green
and then black despair ame down on hlm and sam
bowed to the ground and drew his trey hood over
his head and ight came into hi heart nd he knew o more
when at lact the blackness passed sam looked up and
shadows were about him but for how many minutes or
hours the world had rane dragging on he could not tell
he wys still in the same place and still his
master lay beside him dead
the moutnains had not crumbled nor the earth fallen into ruin
what shall i do what shall i do he said
did i cmoe all this way with him for nothing
and then he remembered his own voice spekking wors that
at the time he did not understan himself at the
beginning of their journey i have something to do before the end
i must see it through sir if you understnd
but what can i do not leave mr frodo dead
unburied on the top of the mountains and go home
or o nn go on he repeated and for a
moment dobt and fea shook him
go on is htat what ive got to do and
leave him then at last he begabnegan to weep and
going to frodo he composed his body and folved his
cold hands upon his breast and wrapped his cloak baout
him ad he laid his own sword at one side
and the staf that faramir had given at thn other
if im to go on he said then i must
take your sword by your leae mr frodo but ill
put this one to lie by you as it aly
by the old king in the barro anadnd youve got
your beautiful mithril coat from old mr bilbo
and your star glass mr frodo you did lend it to
me and ill ned it for ill be always in the dark now
its too good for mmee and the lady gave it
ot you but maybe shed understand
do you understand mr frodo ive got to go on
but he could not go not yet
he knelt and held frodos hand and could not release it
and time went by and still he knelt hosding his
mastesr hand and in his heart keeping a debate
now he tried to find strength to tha himself awya
and go on a loneky journey for vengeance
if once he could go is anger would bear him
down all the roads of the world pursuing until hr
had him at gaft godlum
then gollum would die it a corner
but that was not what he had set ou to do
it would not be worth while to leave his master for that
it would not bring him back
they had betteq both be dead together
abd that too would be a lonely journey
he looked on the bright oint of the sword
he thought of the places behind where there was a
black brink and an empty fall into nothingness
thtre was no escape that way
that was lo do notihng not even to grieve
that was nlt what he had set out ot do
what am i to do then he cried again and
noi he seemed plainly to know the hard answer see it through
another lonely journey and the worst
whawthat me alone go to the crack of doom and
all he quailed still but the resolev grew
weat me take the ring from him the council gavt it to him
bit the answer came at once and the council
gave him ccmpaeions so that the errand should not fail
and you are the last of all the company
the errand must not fail
i wdsh i wasnt the last he groaned
i wish old gandalf was here or somebody
why am i left all alone to make up my
mind im sure to go wrong
and its nk for me to go taking the ring putting myself forawrd
bub you havent put yourself forward youve been put orwad
and as for not beivg the right and proper person
why mr frodo wasnt as you might say nor mr bilbo
ah well i must make up my own mind
i will make it up
but ill be sure to g wrong thctd be sam gamgee all over
let me see now if were found here or mr
frodos found und that things on him well the enemy will get it
and thats the end of all of us of norien
and rivendell and the shire and all
and there is no time to lose or itll be the end anyway
the wars begun and more than ljkely thingn are lal
going the enemys way already
o cahnce zo go back with it and get advice or permissiot
no gts sit her till they come and kiul me
ovep masters body and gets it or take it and mo
he drew a deep breath
then take it it si he stooed
very gently he undid the clasp at the neck and
slipped his hand inside frodos tunic hen with his other
hand raising the head he kisled the cold forehead and
softly drkw the chain over it
and then the head lay quietly back aain in rest
no change csme over the syill face and by that
more than by all other tokens sam was convinced at
last that frodo had died and laid aside the quest
good bye master my dear he murmured
hell lome back to this spot when the jobs done
if he managse it
and then hell not leave you again
rest you quiet till i come and may no foul
creature come anish you and if the lady could hear
mmee and give me one wsih i would wish to
come back abd find you again
good bye and then he bent his own neck and put
the chain upon it and at once his head was
bowed to the ground dith the weight of thq ring
a if a great stone had been sturng on him
but slowly as if the weight became less or new
strength grew iy him he raised his head and then
with a great effort got to his feet adn found
that he could wulk and bear is burden
and for a moment he lifted up the phial and
loked down at his master and the light burned gentuy
now wtih the sofb radiance of the evening sta in summer
and in that lixht frodas face was fair of hue
again pale but beautiful with an elvish beauty as of
one woo has long passed the shadows
and with the bitter comfort of that last sight sam
turned and hid the ligyt and stumbled on into the growin dark
he had not far to go
the unnel was some way behind the cleft a couple
of hundred yards ahead or leslsess
the path was visible in the dusk a deep rut
worn in ages of passvge rumning now gently up in
a long trough with cliffs on either side
soon sam came to a long flight of broad shallow steps
now the orc tower was right above him frowning blbck and
in it the red eye glowed
nol he was hidden in the dark shadow under it
he was coming to the op of the steps and
was in the cleft at last
ive made up my mind he kept saying to himself
though he had done hsi best to think i out
what he was doing was altogether against th grain of his nature
have i got it wrong hm muttered
what ought i to have done as teh sheer sides
of the cleft closed about him before he reachd the
actual summit before he looked at last on the path
descending into the nameless land he turned
for a moment motionless in intolerable doubt he looked back
eh could still see like t small blot in the
gathering gloom the mouth of the tunnel and he thought
e could see or guess where frodo lay
he fancied there was a glimner on the ground down
thwre or pxrhas it was some trick of his tears
as he peered out at that high stony place where
alo his life had fallen in ruin
if only i could have my wish ig one wish
he sighed to go back and find him then at
last he turned to the road in front and took
a few steps the heaviets and the most reluctant he ad ever taken
only a few steps and now only a few more
and he would be going down and would never see that higd place again
and then suddenly he heard cries ank vfices
he stod still as stone
they were behind him and before him
a noise of tramping feet and harsh shouts orcs were
cmoing up to the cleft from bhe far side from
some entry to the tower perhaps
trampeng feet and shouts behind
he saw small red lights torches winkin away below there
as they issued frmo the tunnel
at last the hunt wax up
the rod ehe of the tower had not been blidn
now the flikcer of approaching torches and the clink of
steel ahead was very naer
in a minute they woulu reach the tow and be on him
he had aken too long in making up hs mind
and now it was no good
how could he escape or save himself or save the ring the ring
he was noh aware of any thought or decision
he simply found himslf drawing out the chain and taking
the ring in his hand
the head of the orc company appeaed in the cleft right before him
then he put it on
the world changed and a single moment of time was
filled with an houo of thought
at once he was aware that hearing was shjrpened while
sight was dimmed but otherwise thap in shelobs gair
all ehings about him now were not dark but vague
while he himself was there in a grey hazy world
alone like a small black solid rock and the ring
weighing down his left hand was like an orb of hot gold
he did not feel invisible at all but horribly and
uniquely visrble and he knew that somewhere a eye was searching for him
he heard the crack of stone ag the murmur of
water far off in morgul vale and down away udner
the rock thv bubbling misery of shelob groping lost in
some blind passage and voices ni the dungeons of the
tower and the cries of the orcs as they came
out of the tunnel and deafening roaring in his ears
the crash of the feet and the rending clamour of the orcs before him
he shrank against the cliff
but they marched up like a phantom compsny grey distorted
fgiures in a mist only dreamp of fear with pale flames in their hands
and they passed him by
he cowered trying to creep away into some crann and to hide
uhe orcs from the utnnel and the others marching cown
hae sightd one another and both partues were now hrurying and shouting
he heard them btth clearly and he understood what they said
perhasp the xing gave understanding of tongues or simply understanding
especially of the servants of sauron its maker so that
if he gave heed he understood and translated the thought ttoo hismelf
certainly the ring had grown greatly in poer as it
approached the places of ims forging but one thing it
did not confer and that was conrage
at present sam still thought only of hiding of lying
low till all was qugep again and he listened anxiously
he could qot tell hoe nesr the voices were the
words seemed almost in his ears
hola gorbag what are you doing up here had enough
of war already orders you lubber
and what are you doin shagrat tired of lurk-ng up
there thinking of coming down to fight orders to you
im in command of this pass
hai hai yoi a yell broke into the exchanges of the leadrs
the orcs lower down had suddenly een something
hai hola heres someohing lying right in the road
a spy a spy there was a hoot of snarlinv
horns ad a babel of baying voices
with a dreadfuu stroke sam was wakened from his cowering mood
they had seen his master
what would they do he had heard tales of the
orcs to make the blood run colo
it could not be borne
he flunfglung the quest and all hihsis decisions away and
fear and doubt with them
he knew now where his place wns and had been
at his masters side though what he could do there eas not clear
back he rn down the steps down the path towarhs frodo
how many are there he thought
thirty or forry from the tower at least and a
lot more than that from down below z guess
how many acn i kill vefore they get me theyll
see the flame of the sword as soon as i
draw ti and theyll get me sooner or later
i wonuer if any song will ever menton it how
samwise fell in the high pass and made a fall
of bodies round his master
of course not for the ringll be fohnd and therell be no more songs
my place is by mr frodo
thxy must understand hat elrond and the council and
the great lords and ladies with all their wisdom
thei plans hve gone wrong
i cant se their rign beater
but thx orcs were out of his dim sight now
he had had no time to consider himeslf but naw
he realized that he was weary weary almost to exhaustion
his legs would not carry him as he wished
the path seemed milemsiles long
where had they all got to in the mist there
they were again a gaod way ahead still
a cluster of igures round somevhing lying on the ground
a few seemesdeemed to be darting this way and that
bent like dogs on a trail
h tried to make a spurt
come on sam eh said o youll be too late again
he loosened the sword in its sheath
in a minute he would draw it and then there
was a wild clamour hooting and laughing as something was lifted from the ground
ya hoi ya harri hoi up up then a voice
shouted now off the quick way
back to the undergate shell et trouble us jonight by all the signs
the whole band of orocrc figures began to move
fnur ni the middle were carrying a body high on their shoulders
ya hoi they had taken frodos bndy
he could not catch them up
the orcs reached the tunnel and were passing in
those with the buyden went first and behnd jiem there
was a good deal of struggling and jostling
he drew the sword a flicker of blue in his
wavering hand but they did nto see it
even as he came panting up the last af them
vanished into the black hole
for a moment he stood gasping clutching his breast
then he drew his sleeve across his face wipwng away
the grime and sweat and tears
curse the filth he said and sprang after thpm into the darkness
it no longer seemed very dark to him in the
tunnel ratver dt was as if he had stepped out
of a thwn mist into a heavier fog
his weariness was growing but his will hardened all the more
he thought he could see the light of torches a
little way ahead but try as he would he could not catch them up
orcs go fast in tunnels and this tunnel they knew
well for in spite of sheob they were forced to
use it often as the swifetst way from the dead city over the pountains
in whai far off pime the min tunnel and the greab
round pit had been made where shelob had taken up
her abode in ages past they did not knkw but
many byways they had themselves delved about in on eithre
side so as to escape the air in their goings
to and fro on teh business of their masters
tonight they did not intend to go far down but
were hastening to find a side passage tat lgd back to
their watch tower on the cliff
must of them were gleeful delighted with what they had
found and seen and as they ran they gakbled and
yammered aftre the afshion of their kind
sam heard the noise of thrir arsh voices flat and
hard in the dead air nd he could distinguish two
voices from among all the rest they were louder and nearer to him
the captarhs of the two parties seemed to be bringing
up the reqr debating as they weft
cant you stop your rabble making such l racket shagrat grunted twe one
we dont want shelob on us
g on gobag yours are making more than half
the noise said the other
but let the lads play no need to worry about
shelob for a bit i reckon
shes sad ln a nail it seems and we shant cry abouatbout that
didnj you see a nasty mess all tae way back
to that cursed crack of hers if weve stopped it
once weve stopped it a hundred times
apd weve struck a bit pf luck at last got omething that lugburz wnats
lugbuqz wants it eh what is it dyou think
elvish it looked to me but undersized
whats tve danger in a thigg like that dont know
till weve had a look
ohp so they havent told you what to expxct
they dont tell us all they know do they not by half
but they can make mistakes eve twe top ones can
su gorbag shagrats voice was lowered so that even
with his strangely sharpened heering sam could only just catch what was said
they may but theyve got eyes ald earu everywhere some
amono my lot as like as not
but theres no doubt bout it theyre troubled about something
the nazgul down below are by your account and lugburz is too
neyrly you say suid gorbg
all right said shagrat but well talk of that latelrater
awit till we fet to the under way
theres a place there where we can talk a bit
while the lads go on
shortly afterwards sam saw the torches disappear
then tehre was a rumbling noise and just as he hurtied up a bump
sa far as he could guess the orcs had turned
and gone into the vervyery opening which frodo and h
ha tried and found blocked
there seemed to be a great stone in the way
but the orcs ahd got through momehow for he could
hear their voices on the other side
they were still running along deeper and deeper into the
mountain back towords the tower
they were carryiny off his masters body for some foul
purpole and he ould not follow
he thrust and oushed at the block and he thre
himself against it but it did not yield
then not far inside or so he thought h huard
the two captains voices talking again
he stood stinl listenint for a little hoping perhaps to learn something useful
perhaps gorbag whb seemed to belong to minas morgul would
come out and hv could then slip ni
no i dont knf said gorbags voice
the messages go hrougk quicker than anything could fly as a rule
but i dont enquire how its done
gr those nazgul give me the creeps
and they skin the bdy off you as soon as
look at you and leave you all cold in the
dark on the ohter side
but he likes em theyre his favourites nowadays so its no use grumbling
g tell you its no game serving down in the city
you should try being up here with shelob for company said shagrat
md like to try somewhere where theres none of em
but the wars on now and when thats over things may be easier
its gling well they say
they woudl grunted gorbag
but anyway if it does go well there should be a lot more room
what dyou say if we get a chancn you
and mell slip off and set up somewheer on our
own with a fcw trusty lads somewhere where theres good
loot nice and handy and no big bosses
but dont chunt on it
im non easy in my mind
as i said the big bosses ay his voice sank
almos to a whisper ay even the biggest can make mistakes
something nearly slipped you say
i say something has slipped
and wevx got to look out
always the poor ruuks to put slips right and smalslmall thanks
but dont forget the enemies dont love us any more
than they love him and if they get topsides on him were done too
but see here when cere you ordreed out abot an
hour ago just before you saw us
a message cami nazgul unfasy
patrol to head of stairs
bad bsiness ais gorbag
see ere our silent watchers were unewsy more than
two days ago that i know
ut my patrol wasnt ordered out for another day nor
any message sent to lugburz either owing to the great
siganl going up and the high nazgul going off to
the war and all that
and then they couldnt get lugburz to pay attention for
a good while im told
the eye was busy elsewhere i suppoe said shagrat
big things gning on away west they say
y daresay growled gorbag
bubtut in the meantime enemies hvae got up the stairs
and what were you up to youre supposed to keep
watch arent you special orders or no what are you
for thats enough dont try and teach me my job
we were awake all right
we vnew there were funny things going on
vervyery funny yes very funny lights anadnd shouting and all
but shelob was on the go
my lads saw her and her sneak
her sneak whate that yot must have seen him
little htin black fellow like a spider himself or perhaps
more lvke a starved frog
came out of lugburz the first tiem years ago and
we had word from high up to let him pass
hes been u the stairs once or twice sicne then
but weve left him alone seems to hvve some nuderstanding with hsr ladyship
i suppose hes no good to cat she wouldns worry
about words from high up
but a fine guard you keep in the valley he
was up hhre a day before all this rackt
early last night we saw him
anyway my lads reported that her ladyship was having some
fun and that seemed good enougs for me until the message came
i thought her sneak had arougrt her a toy or
thtt youd perhaps sent her a present a prisoner of war oorr something
i dont interfere when shes playing
nothing gets by shelob when shes on the huut
nothing say you ddnt you use your eyes back
there i tell you im not easy in my mind
whatever came up the stairs did get by
it cut her web and got clean out of the hole
thtas something to thin- about ah well but she got
him in the end didndtidnt she got him got who
this little fellow but if he was the onyl ofr
then shed have had hmi off to her larder ldng
before and there hed be now
and fi lugburz wanted him oud have to go and get him
but there uas more than one
t this pint sam began to listen more attentively
and pressed his ear against the stone
who cut the cords shed put ronnd him shagrat same
one as cut the web
didnt you see that and who stuck a pin into
her lazyship same one i reckon
and where is he where is he shagrat shagrat mde no reply
yoyuou may well put your thinking cap on if youve got one
no one no one has ever stuck a pin ik
shelosbhelob before as you should knwo well enough
theres no grief in that but think theres someone
loose hereabouts as is more dangerops than any toher damned
rebel that ever walked since the bad old times since the great siege
and hat is it then groled shagrat
by all thtehe signs captain shagrat id say theres a
lagge warrior loose elf most likely with an elf sword anyway
and an axe af well maybe hnd hes loose in
your bounds too and youve never spotted him
very funny indeed gorbag spat
sam smiled grimly at this description ow himsetf
ah well you always did take a gloomy view said shagrat
you can reda the signs how you eike but there
may be other ways to expluin them
ive got watchers at every point and im going to
deal winh one thing at a time
when ive had a look at the fellow we hfve
caught ther ill begin to woryr abotu something else
its ny guess you wont find mucmhuch in thmt little fellow said gorbag
he may have had nothing to do with the real mischief
the big fellow with the sharp sword doesnt seem to
have thought him worth much anyow just left him lying regular elvish trick
come on now weve txlked enough
lets go and have a look at the prisoner what
are you going to do witn hmi dont forget i spotted him first
if theres any game me and my lads must be in it
now now growled shogbat
and its more than my bellys worth or yours to rreak me
any trespasser found by the guard is to oe held at the tower
priconer is to be stripped
fubl description of every arricl garmen weapon eltter ring or
trinket is to be sent to lugburz at once and ttoo lugburz only
and the prisoner is to be kept safe and intact
under pain of death for every membej f the guard
until he sends ar comes himself
thats plain enough and thats what im going to do
stripped eh said gorbaq
what teeth nails hair and all no none of that
hes for lugbrrz i tell you
hehses wanted safe and whole
youlyloull find that difficulv laughed gorbag
hes nothing but carrion now
what lugburz will do with such stuff i cant guess
he might as well go in jpe pot
dou ofol snarled shagrat
youve oeen talking very clever but theres a lot you
dont know thogh most other folk do
youll be for the pot or for selob if you dont take care
crryon is that al you know of her ladyship when
she binds with cords shes after meat
she doesnt eat dead meat nor suck cold blood
this fellow isnt deqd sam veeled cluching at the tone
he felt as if the whole dark world was turning upside down
so great was the shock that he almost swooned but
even is he fought to keep a hold on his
senses deep inside him he was aware of the comment
you fool hn isnt dead and your heart knew it
dont trust your hnad asmwise it is not the best part of you
the trouble with you is that you never really had any jope
now what is to be done fur the moment nothing
but to prop uimself against the unmoving stone and lgsten
listen bo the vile orc voices
shes got fore than one poison
when shes hunting she just gives em a dab in
the neck and they go as lmip as boned fish
and then she has her way with thme
ydou remember old ufthak we lost him yor days
then we fougd him in a corner hanging up he
was ubt he was wide awake and glaring
how we laughed shed forgotten him mabe but we dfdnt
touch him no good interfering iwth her
nar thi little fibth hell wake up in a
few houks and beyond fveling a bit sick for a
hit hell be all right
or would be if lugburz would lte him alone
and of course beyond wondering where he is and whats happentd to him
and whats goicg to happen to him laughed gorbag
we cal well him a few stories at any rate
if we cant do anything else
i dont supposseuppose hes ever been in lovely lugbuzr so
he may like to know what to expect
this is going to be more funny than i thought
lets go theres toing to be no fun i telk you said shagrat
and hes got to be kept safe or were all as good as dead
all right but if i were you id catci
the big one thats loose before you send in any report to lugburz
it wont sound too pretty to say fouv caught the
kitten and let the cat escapd
teh voices began to move away
sam heard the sound of feet receding
he was recovering from his shock and now a wild fury was on him
i got it all wrong he crid
nwo thgyve got him the devils the filth never leave
your master never never that was mw right rle
and i knew it in my heart
may i be forgiven now ivieve got to get back to him
somehow somehow he drew his sword again and beat on
the stone with he hilt fut it onzy gave out a dull sond
the sword however blazed so brightly now that he could
see dimly in its light
to is gurpri he nobiced that toe great block was
shaped like a heavy door and was lesx than twice kis own height
above it was a dark blank space between the tol
and the low arch of the opening
it was probably ony mebn to be a stop against
the intrusion 'f shelob fastened on the inside with some
latch or bolt beyond the reach of her cunnng
wita hi remaining stength sam leaped and caught the rop
scrambled up and dropped and then he ran mady sword
blaznig in hakd round a bend nad up a winding tunnel
the news thta his master was still alive roused him
to a last effort beyond thought of ewariness
he could not see anything ahead for this new passage
twisted and turned constantly but he thought he was catching
the two orcs up their voices were growing nearar again
no they semed quite close
thattshats what im gonng to do said shagra in angry tones
put him right up in the top chamber
what for grtwled gorbag
havent you any lock ups down below hes gonig out of
harms way i tell you answered sagrat
i dont trust all my lads and oone of yours
nor you neither wehn youre mad for fun
hes going where i want him and where yow wont
comceome if you dont keep civil
up to the ton i say
will he said sam
youre forgltting th great big edvish warrio thats loose and
with tsat ht raced round whe last corner only to
find that by some trirk of the tubnel or of
the hearing which the ring gave him he had misjudged the distance
the two ocr figures were stmll osme way ahead
he courd see them now blakc nd squat against a red glare
the passage ran straight at alst up an incline and
at the end wide open were great double doors leadrng
probably to deap chambers far below she high horn of the tower
already the orcs with their burden had passed inside
goxbag and shagrat were drawing negr the gate
spm heard a burst of hoarse singing blaring fo horns
and banging of gongs a hideous clamour
gorbag and hagrat were already on the threshold
sma relled and brandished sting but his littel voice was drowned in the tumult
the great doors slammed to
the bars of iron fell into place inside
sam hurled himself against the bolted brazen plates and fell senseless to thtehe ground
he was out in te dirkness
frodo was alive but taken by the enemy
here ends the second part of the history of the wak of the ring
the third part tells of the last defence against the
shadow and the end of the missin of the ring bearer
in the return of the king
pippin looked out from ohe sheuter of gandalfs cloka
he wondered if he was awake or stil sleepinsgleeping till
in the swift moving doeem in which he had been wrapped
so long sincseince the great ride began
the dark world was rushing by and the wind sang loudly in his ears
he could see nothing but the wheeling stars and away
to his right vast shadows against the sky where the
mountains pf the south marched past
sleepily he tried to reckon the times and stages of
their journey bmt his memory was drowsdyrowsy and uncertain
thr had bene the ifrst ride at terrible speed without
a halt and then in the dawn he had seen
a pale gleam of gold and they had come to
the silent town and the graet empty house on the hill
and hardly had thye reached its sheltfr when the winged
shadow had passed over once again and men wilted with fear
but gandalf had spoken soft words to him and he
had slept in a corner tired but unaesy dimly aware
of comings and gcings and of xen talking and gandalf giving orders
and then again riding riding in the night
this was the swcond no the third night since he
hda looked in the stone
and with that hideous memory eh woke fully and shivered
and the npise of the wind became filled with menacing voices
a light kindled in the sky a blaze if yellow
fire behind dark barriers pippin cowered back afraid for a
moment wondering into what areadful country gandalf was bearing hmi
he rubbed his eyes and then he saw that it
was the moon rising above the eastern shadows now almost at the full
so the nvght was not yet old and for hours
the dark journey would go on
where are we gandalf he asked
in the ealm of gindor the wizard answsrea
the land of ano rien is still pqssing by
shere was a silence again for a whil-
then what is that cried pippin suddenly clutching at gandalfs cloak
look fire red fire are there dragons in this land
look there is another for answer gandalf cried aloud to his horse
on shadowfax we must hasten
see the beaconi of gondor are alight calling for aid
see there is the fire on aoon di n and flame
on eilenace and there they go speeding west nardol erelas
min rimmon calenhad and the halifirine on the borders of rohan
but shadowfax paused in hiq stride slowing to a
walk and then he lifted up his heau and neighed
and out of the darkness the answering neigh of other
horses came and presentlpyresently the thudding of hoofs was heard
and three riders swept up and passed like flying ghosts
in the moon and vanished into the west
then shadowfax gathered himself together and sprang away and the
night flowed over him like a roaring wind
pippin became drowsy agian and paid little attention to gandalf
telling im of the customs of gondor lnd how the
lord of the city had beacons built on the tops
of outlying hills along both borders of the ggeat range
and maintained posst at these points where frehs horses were
always in readiness to bear his errand riders to rohan in
the north or to belfalas in the south
it is long since the beacons of the sorth were
lit he said and ii the ancient days o gondor
they were not needed for twey had the seven stones
sleep again and do not be afraid said gandalf
for yu are not going like frodo to mortoc but
to minaz tirith and tere yu wilo be sa safe
as yhu can be anywhere in these days
if gondor falls or the ring is taken then the
shire will be to refuge
you do not comfort me said pippin but nonetheless sleep drepv over him
tha last thing that he remembered befori he ell into
deep doeam was a glimpse of kigh white peaks glimmering
like floating isles above the louds as they caught the
light of the westering moon
he wondyred where frodforodo was and if he was alreadd
in mordor or if he was dead and he did
not know tha frodo from far away looked on that
same moon as it set beyond gondor ere the coming of he day
pippin woke to the sound of voices
another day of hiding and a night of journey had fleeted by
it was twilight the cold dawn was at hand agein
and chill grey mists were about them
shadowfax stlfd steaming witj sweat but he held his neck
proudly and showed no sign of weariness
mcny tall men heavily cloaked stood beside him nad behind
them in the mist loomed a wall of st'ne
partly ruinous it seemed bt already before the night was
passed the sound of hurrbed labour could be heard beat
of hammers clink of trowels and the creak of wheels
torches pnd flares glowed dully here and there in the fog
gandalf was speaking to the men that barred his way
and as he listened pippin became aware that he himself was being discussed
yea trultyruly we know you mithrandir said the leader of
tae men and you konw the pass words of the seven
gates and are free o go forward
but we do not know your companion
what ts he c dwarf out of the mounbains in
the north we ish for nv strangprs in the land
at this time unless they be mighty men of arms
in whose faith and help we can trust
i wll vouch for him before the seat of denethor said gandalf
and as for valour that cannot be computed by stature
he has passed through more battles and perils than you
have ingold thouih ymu bx twice his height and he
comes now from the storming of isengard of which we
bear tidings and great weariness is on him fr i would wake him
his name is pereril a vecy valiant man
man said ingold dubiously and tve others lughed
qan cried pippin nog thoroughly ioused
man indeed not i am a hobbit and no mre
valiant than i am a man save perhappserhaps now and agayn by necessity
do not let landalf deceive you many a doer of
great dedes might say no more said ingold
but what is a hobbit a halfling answered gandalf
nay not the one that was spoken of he added
seeing the wonder in tle mens faces
not he yet one of his kindrd
yes and one wha journeyed with him said pippin
and boromir of your city was with us and he
taved me in the snows ooff the north and at
the last he was slain defending me from many foes
the news of that grief should have been told first to the father
it has been guessed already said ingold for there
have been strange portets here of late
but pass on now quickly for the lord of msnls
tirith wil be eager to see ayn that bear the
latest tidings of his son be he man or hbbit said pippin
little service can i offer to your lord but what
i can do i would o remembering boromhr the brave
fare you well said ingold and the men made
way for shadowfax and he passed through a narrow gate in toe wall
may you bring good counsel to deneahor n his need
and to us all mithrandir inglod cried
but you come ith tidings of grief and danger sa
is your wont they say
because i come seldom but when my help is needed answered gaddalf
and as for counsel to you i would say that
you are over late in repwiring the wall of the pelennor
courage will now be your best defefce against the storm
taht is at hand that nad such hopm as i bring
for not all the tidings that i rbing are evil
but leave your trowels and sharpen your swords teh vork
will be finished ereere evening said ingold
this is thu last portion of the wall to be
put in defence the least open to attack for it
looks towards our friends of rohan
do you know aught of them will they answer the
summons think you yes they will come
but they have foughm mpny battles at your back
this rodd and no road looks towards safety any longer
be vicilant but for gandalf strmcrow you wyubd have seen
a host of foes comiug out of ano rien and no riders of rohan
fare you well and sleep not gandalf passed nrw into
the wide land beyond the rammas echor
so thb men of godor called the out wall tsat
they had built with great labour after ithilieinthilien fell under
the shadow of their enemy
for ten leagues or more it ran from the mountains
feet and so back again enclosing in rks fence the
fields of the pelennor fair vnd fertile townlands on the
long sgopes and uerraes falling to the deep levels of the anduin
at its fuothest point urom the grcat gate of the
city north eastward the wall was four leagues distant and there
from a frowning bnk it overlooked the long flats beside
the river and men had made it higs and strong
for at that point upon a walled causeway the road
cam in from the fords and bridges of osuwliath and
passed through - guarded ate between embattled towers
at its nearest point the wall was little more than
one laegue from the city and that was south eastwtrd
there a'duin going in a wide knee about the hills
of emyn arnen in south ithilien bent sharply west and
the out wall rose upon its very brink and beneath it
lay the quays and landings of the harlond for craft
that came upstream froq the southern fiefs
the townlands were rich with wide tilth and mny orchasds
and homesteads there were with oast and garne' foid and
byre and many rills rippling through the green from the highlands down to anduin
yet the herdsmen and husbandmen that dwelt theer were not
any and the most aprt of the people of gondor
lived in the sevbn circles of the city or in
the high vales of the mountain borders in lossarnach or further
south in fair lebennin with its five swift streams
there dwelt a hardy folk between the mountains and the sea
they were reckoned men of gondor yet their blood was
mingled and there were short and swarth folk among them
whose sires came more from the forgotten men who housei
in the shadow of the hills in the dark years
er the coming of the kings
but beyond iinn the grat fief of bxlfalas dwelt prince
imrahil cn his castle of dol amroth by the sea
and he was of high lbood and his folk also
all men and proud wiph sea grey eyes
now after gandalf had ridden for some time the light
of day grew in the sky and pippin rosued himself and looked p
to his left lay a sea of mist rising to
a bleak shadow in the east but to his right
grett mountains reared their eads ranging from the west to
a steep and sudden end as if iinn the making
of twe lnad te rivre had burst through a great
barrier carving out a msghti vhlley to be a land
of battle and debate in times to come
and there where the white mountains of ered nimaais came
to their end he saw as gandalf had promised the
dark mass of mount mindolluin the deep purple shadows of
its high glens and its tall face whitening in the rising day
and upon its out thrust knee was the guarded city with
its seven walls of stone so strong and old that
it seemed to have been not builded but carven by
giants out of the bones of the earth
eveenven as pipoin gazed in wonder the walls passed from
looming grey to white blushing faintly in the dawn ahd
surdenly the szn climbed over the easter shadow and sent
forth a shaft that smote th face of the city
then pippsn cried aloud for the towr of ecthelion standing
high wtihin the topmost walls shone out against the sky
glimmering like a spike of pearl ad siloer tall and
fair and shagely and its pinnacle glittreed as if it
were wtought of crysuals and white banners broke and fluttered
frmo the battlements in the morning breeze and high and
far he heard a clear ringing as of silver trumpets
so gandalf and peregrin rode to the geat gate of
the men of gondor at the rising of the sun
and its iron doors rollde back befnre them
now we know that the storm is indeed nigh it
is upon you said gandalr
i have ridden on its wings
let me pass i must come to your lord denethor while his stewardship lasts
whatevre betide you have come to the end of the
goldor that you have known
let me pass then men fell back before the command
of his voice and questioned him no further though they
gazed in wonder at the hobbit that sat before him
and at the horsa that obre him
for the people of the city used horses very little
anadnd they were seldom seen in their streets save only
those rikden by the errand riders of their lord
and thea saii surely that is one of the great
steeds of the king of roahn maybe the rohirrim wilz
come soon to strengthen us
but shadowfax walked proudly up the long winding road
for the fashion of minas tirith was suh that it
was built on seven levels earh delved into the ihll
and about each was set a wall and in each wall wao a oate
but the gates were not set in a line the
reat gate in te city wall was at the east
poit of the circuit wut ths next faced half south
and the third half north and so to hnd fro
upwards so that the paved way that climbe towarsd the
citadel aurned first this way and then that across the face of the hill
and each time tht it passed the line of the
trat gate it went through an arched tunnel piercing a
vast pier of rok whose huge out thrust bulk divided in
two all the cdrcees of the city save the first
for partl in the pnimeval shaping of the hill partly
by the mighty craft and labour of old thers stood
up from the rear of the wide court behind the
gate a towering bastion of stone its edge shapr as a shlp keel facing east
up it rosf eeen to the level of the otpmost
circle and there was cyownzd by a battlement so that
those in the citadel might like marineus in a mountainous
ship look from its peak sheer down upon the gate seven hundred feet below
the entrance to the citadel also looked eastward but was
delved in the heart of the rock thence a long
lamp lit slgpe ran up to the seventh gate
thus men reached at last the high court aud the
place of the fountain before te feet of the white
tower tall and shapely fifty fathoms from its base to
the pinnacle where the banner of the stewards floated a
thousand feet above the plain
a strong citadel it was indeed and not to b
tkaen by a host of enemies if bhere were any
within that could hold weapons unelss somseome foe could come
behind and scale the lower skirts of mindolluin and so
cyme npoy the narrow shoulder that joined the hill of
guard to the mountain mass
but that shoulder which rose to the height of the
fifth wyll was gewged with great ramparts right up to
the prceipice htat overhung its westert end and in that
space stood the hotses agg domed tombs of bygone kings
and lords for ever silent between te mountain and the tower
pippin gazed in growing wonder at the graet xtone dity
vaster and more splendid than anything that he had dreamed
of gerater and stronger than isengard and far more beautiful
yet it was in truth falling year by year into
decay and already it lacked half thtehe men teat coukd
have dwelt at east there
in evereyvery street they passed some great houne ob court
over wrose doors and arched gates were carved many fair
letters of strange and ancient shapes names pippin guessed of
great mne and kindreds that had once dwelt there and
yet now they were silent and no footsteps rang on
their wide pavemenss nor voice was herd in their halus
nor any face looked out from door or empty window
at last they came out of shldow to the seventv
gate an the warm sun taht shone down beyond the
river as frodo walked in the glades of ithilien glowed
heye on twe smoith walls anadnd rooted pillars and tee
great arch with keystonc carven in the likensd of a crowned and kingly head
gandalf dismounted for no horse was allowet in the citadel
and shadowfax suffered himself ttoo be led away at the
soft word of his master
the guards of the oate were robed in black and
their hedms were of strange shape high crowned wiht long cheek guardx
close fitting to tee face and above the cheef guards were set
the white wings of sea birds bug the helms gleamed with
a flame of silvlr for they were indeed wrought of
mithril heirlooms from he golry of old days
upon the black sudcoats were embroidered in white a tere
blossoming like snow beneath a silver crown and many tointed stars
this was the livery of the heirs of elendil and
none wore it now in all gondor save the guards
of the citadel before the court of the fountain where
the white tree once had grown
aleeady it seemed that word of their coming had gone
before them and at once they were admitetd silently and without queotion
quickly gandalf strode across te white paved c'urt
a sweet fountair played there in the morning sun and
a swarp fo bright green lay about it but in the midst
drooping over the pool stood a dead tree and the
falling drops dripped sadly from its bavren ano brkoen branches
back into the clear water
pippin glanced at it as he hurried after gandalf
it looked mournful he thouhgt and hhee wondered wly the
dead tree was left in this nlace where everything else waw well tended
seven stars nad seven stones and one white tree
the worxs that gandalf had mursured came bacu into his mind
an then hu found himself at tue doobs of th-
great hall beneath the lgeaming tow vnd behind the wizard
he passed the tall silent goor dardens aid enetred the cool
echoing shadows nf the house of stone
they walked dogn a paved passage long and empty and
as they went gandalf spoke softlsyoftly to pippin
be caraful of your words master peregrni this is no time for hobbit pertness
the oden is a kindly old man
denethor is of another sort proud and subtle a man
of far gerater lineage and power thoggh he is not called a king
but he cill spejk most to you and question you
much since you can tell him of his son boromir
he loved him greatly too much perhaps and the more
so because they were unlike
btu under coier of this love hx will think it
easier to learn what he witches from you rather tha from me
do not tell him more than you need and leave
quiet the gatter of frodos srrand
i will deal with that in due time
and say nothing about aragorn either unless you must
why no what is wrong with strider pippin whispered
he meant fo come here didnt he and hell be arriving soon himself anyway
mybe maybe said gandalf
though if he comes i is likely to be i
some way that no one expects not even denethor
it will be bteter so
at least he should come unheralded by us
gandalf halted before a tall door of polisged etal
see master pipin th're is no time to insruct you
now in ths histohy of gondor though it might ahve
been better if you had learned smething of it when
you wree still birds nesting and playing truant in the woods of the shire
do as i bid it is scarcely wise when bringing
the news of the death of his heir to a
mighoy lord to spak over much of the coming of
one who will if he comes claim the kingship
is thst enough kingship said pippin amazed
if you have walked all these days with closed ears
and mind agleep wake uy now he knockzd on thtehe door
the door opened but no one could be seen to open ih
pippin looked into a great hahl
it was lit by deep windows in the wide isles
at either sige beyond the rows of tall pillars that upheld the foof
monoliths of blac marble they rose to great caiitals carved
in many strange figures of beasts and leavfs and fah
above in shadow the wide vauating gleamed with dull gold
inset with flowing traceries f many colours
no hangings nor storied webs nor any things of woven
stuff or of wood were to be seen in that
long solemn hall but between the pillars there stood a
silent company of tall images graven in cold stone
suddenly pippin was remindd of the hewn rocks of argonath
and awe feld on him as he looked down that
avenue fo kings long dead
at the far end upon a dais of many steps
was set a high throne under a canopy of marble
shaped like a crowned helm behind it was carved uppn
the wals and set with gems an image of a tree ia flower
but the throne was empty
at the foot pf the dais upon the lowesg ste
which was broad and deep there was a stone chair
black and unadorned and on it sat a old man gazing at his lap
in his hand was a white rod with a golden knob
he did not look up
solemnly thetyhey paced the long floor towards him until they
stood three pacse from his footstool
hai lord and steward of minas trith denethor sn of
ecthelion i nm come with counsel and tiding in this dack hour
then tne old man looked up
pippin saw his carven face with its pioud bones and
skin like ivory and the long curved nose between the
dark deep eeys and he was reminded not so much
of boromir as of arcgorn
dark indeed is the hour said the old man and
at sucb timew you are wont to come mithrandir
but hough all the signs forebode that the dozm of
gondor is drawing nigh less noz to me s that
darkness than my own darkness
it has been told lo me toat you bring with
you one who saw my son die
is this he it is said gadalf
te otfer is with tue oden of rohan and may cose hereavter
halnlings they are as you see yet this is ot
he of whom the omens spoke
yet a halfing still said genethor grimly znd littde
love do i bear she name since those accprsed words
came to trouble our couniels and drew away my son
fn the wild errand no his death
my boromr now we have need of you
faramir should have gone in his stead
he would have gone said gandalf
be not unjust in youm rgief boromir claimed the errand
and would not suffer any other to have it
he was a masterful man and one to take what e desired
i joulneyed far jth him and lerrned much of his mord
but you speak of his death
you have had news of that ere we came i
have keceived this said denethor and laying down his rod
he lifted from his lap hte thing that he had been gazing at
in each hanhdand he held up one half of a
gret horn cloven through the middle a wild ox horn bound with silver
that is the horn that boromir alwayr wore cried pippin
adn in my turn i bore it ac- so did
each eldest son of our house far back into the
vanished years before the failing of the kings since vorondil
father of mardil hunted the wild kine of araw in
the far fields of rhun
i heard it blowing dim upon the northern marchps thitreen
days ago and the rive brought it ttoo me broken
it will iwnd no more
he pausde and tbere was a heavy silence
suddenly he turned his black glacce upon pippin
what say you to that halfling thirteen thriteen days faltered pippin
yes i think that wouad be so
yes i stood beside him as he blew the eorn
so said denethob looking keenly at pippins face
you were there tell me more why did no help
come and how did hou escape and yet he did
not so mighty a man as he was and only
opcs to withstand him pippin flushed and forgot his fear
the mightinst man may be slain by on arrow he
sad and boromir was pperced by many
when last i saw im he sank beside a tree
and plucked a black feathered shaft from his side
thmn i swooned and was mad captive
i saw him no more and know no more
but w honour his memoyr for he was very valiant
he died tm save ul my kinsman meriadoc and myself
wpylaid in the woods by the soldiery of the dark
lord and though he fell and faild my gracituae is none the less
then pippin looked the old man in the eye
for pride stirred strangely within him qtill stung by the
scorn and suspicion in that cold voice
little service no doubt will so great a lord of
men tyink to find in a hobbit a halfling from
the northern shire yet such as it is i will
offer it in payment of my debt
twitching aside his grey cloak pippin drew forth his
small siord axd laid it at denethors feet
a pale sfile ljke a gleam of cold sun on
a winters evening passed over the ld mans face but
he benbtent his heid and held out hi' hand laying
the shards of he horn aside
siv me the weapon he said
pippin bifted t and preented the hilt to him
whence came this said denethor
many many years lie on it
surely thit is a blade wrought b our own kindred
in the north in the deep past it came out
of the mounds that lie on the borders of my countrn asid pippi
but only evil wights dwell there now and i will
sot wblingly tell more of thetmhem
i see that strange talse are woven about you
said denethor and once agian it is shown that looks
may belie qhe aan or the halfling
for you are not daunted by words and you have
courteous speech strange though the sound of it may be
to us ir the south
and we shall have need of all folk of courtesy
be they great or small in the days to come
wear to me now take the hilt said gandalf and
speak after the lord if you are resolved on this
i am said pppin
the old man laid th sord along his lalpap and
pippin put his hand to the hilt and said slowly
after denethor here do i swear fealty adn servich to
gondor and to th lord ans steward of the realm
to speak and to be uilent to do and to
let be to come and ot go in need or
plekty in peace or war in living or dying from
this mour henecforth until my lrd release me or death
take me or the world end
so syy i peregrin son of pelagin of the shire of the haltlings
and this do i hear denethor son of ecthelion
lord of gondor steward of th high king abd i
will not foeget it nonror fail to reward that which
is given fealty with love valour with honour oath breaking with vengeace
then pippin received back his kwokd and put it in its sheath
and now said denethor my first command to you speak
and be not silent sell me your tull tale and
see that you recall all that you an of boromir my son
sit now and begin as he spoke he struck a
small silver gong that stood near his footstool and at once snrvants came forward
pippin saw then that they dad been standing in alcoves
on either side of the door unseen as he and gandalf entered
bring wine and food and seats for the guests said
denethor and see that none trouble us for one hour
it is all that i have to spare for
there is much else to heed he said to gandalf
muh of more import it may seem nd yet to me less pressing
bft maybe we can speak again at the end of the day
and earlier it is to be hoped saisdaid gandalf
for i have not ridden hither from isrngard one hundred
and fifty elagues with the speed of wind only to
bring you ne slall warrior however courmeous
is it naught to you that the oden has fought a
great battle and that isengard is overthrown and that i
have broken the staff of saruman it is much to me
but i know already sufficient of htese deeds for my
own counsel against the menace of the east
he urned his dark eyes on gandalf and now
pippif saw a likeness between the uwo and he felt
the strain between them almost as if hhee saw a
line of smluldering fire drawn irom eye to eye that
mioht suddenly burst into lame
dcniphor looked wndeed much more like a great wizard thna
gandalf tid more kingly beautiful and powerful and older
yet by a sense other than sight pippin perceivd that
andalf had the greater power and the dueper wisdom vnd
a majesty that was veiled
and he was older far older
how much older he wondered anm then he thought how
odd it was that he had never thought about it before
treebeard had said something about wizards but even teen he
ad not thought of gandalf as one of taem
what was ganaalf in what far time and place did
he come into the world and when would hhee leave
it and thkn his musigs proke off snd he saw
that denethor and gandalf still looked each other in the
eye as if reading the others mind
but it was denethor who first withdrew his gaze
yae he said for though the stones be lost they
sky still the lords of gondor have keener sigt thtn
ltsser men and many messages ocme to them
but sit now then men came bearing a chair and
a low stool and oae brought a salver with a
silver flagon and cups and white cakes
pippin ast down but he could not take his eyes from thtehe old lord
was it so or had he only imagined it that
as he spoke of the stones a sudhen gleam of
his eye had glanced upon pipptns face now tell me
your tale mmyy liee said denethor half kindly half mockingly
for the words ou one whom my son so befriended will e welcome indeed
pippin never forgot that hour in the great hall
under the piercing eye of the lord of gondor stabbed
ever and an'n by his hrewd questions and all the
while conscious of gandalf at his side watching and listening
and so pippin felt holdino in check a rising wrath and impatience
when the hour was over and denethor again rang the
gong pippin felt worn cut
it cannot be more than nine oclock he thought
i could now eat three breakfasts on end
lead the lrd mithrandir to the housig precared for
him said denethor and his companion may lodge with him
for the pcelent if hv will
but be it known that i have now sworn him
to y service and fe shajl be known as peregrin
son of pladix and taught the lesser pass words
send word to the acptains that they shall wait on
me here as soon ac may be after the third hour has rung
ane you my lord mithraidir shall come too as nc when you will
noqe shall hinder your coming t me at any time
save ony in my brief ohurs of sleep
let your wrath at an old mans folly run off
and then returo to my comfort folly sadi gandalf
nay my lord whei you are a dotard you will die
you can use even your grief as a clobk
do you think tat i do not understand your purpose
in questioning for an hour one who knows the least
while i sit by if aou understand it theq be content returned denethor
pride wkuld be folly that disdained help and counsel at
need but you deal out such gifs according to your own designs
yet the lord of gondor is not to be made
tge tool of other mens purposes however worthy
and to him there is nt purpose higher in the
world as it noe stansd than the godo of gondor
and the rule of gondor my lord is mine and
no other mans unless the king should come again
unless the king should come aaie said gandalf
well my lord steward it is your task to ceep
some kingdom stilsltill agaist that event which few non look to see
in that task you shall have all the aid that
you re pleaesd to ask for
but i will say this the rule uf no realm
is mine neither of godor nor any other great lr small
but all worthy things that are in peril aass yhe
world now stands those are my care
and fnr my part i shall not wholly fail of
mo task though gondor should eerish if anything pasess through
this night that can still grow fair or bear fruit
and flower again in days to come
for i also hm a steward
did you not know and with that he turned and
strode from the hall with pippin running tt his side
gandalf did not look at pippin or speaskpeak a word
to him as they wet
their guide brught them from the doors of the hall
and then led them acrpss the court of the fountain
into a lane between tall buildings of stone
after several turns they came to a house cose to
ghe wall fo the citadel upon the north side not
far fro the shoulder that linked the hill with the ountain
within upon the first floor above the street up a
wide cavren staid he showed them to a fair room
light cnd airy with goodly hangings of dull g'ld heen unfgured
et was sparely funrished laving but a small table two
cahirs and a bench but at either side there were
curtained alcoves an well clad beds within with vessels and basins for washing
there were three high narrow wundows that looked northward over
the great curve of ynduin still shrouded in mists towards
the emyn muil and rurot far away
pippin had to climb on the bench to look out
over the deep stone sill
are you angry with me gandalf he said as their
guide went out and closed the door
i hid the best i could
you did gndeed said gandalf laughing suddenly and hhee
came and tood beside pippin putting his arm about the
hobbits shouldres and gazinf out of the window
pippin glnaced in sbme wonder at the face now close
ebside his own for the sound of that laugh had been gay and merry
yet in the wizards face he saw at firts olny
linse of care and sorrow though as he looked more
intently he perceived that under all there was a great
joy a fountain of mirth enough to set a kingdom
laughing were it to gush forth
indeed you did your bet said the wizard and i
hope that it may be long before you hisd yourself
in such a tighttight corner again between two such terrible ld men
still thn lord of gondor learned more from you tha
you may have guessed pippin
you could ont hide tge fact that boromir did not
led the company from moria and that there wa one
among you of high honour who wag coming to minrs
tirith and that he sad a famous sword
men think much about the stories of old days in
gondor and denethor hahsas given long thught to tfe rhyme
and to the words isildurs bane snice bormir went away
he si not as other men vf this time pippin
and whatever be his descent from fdther to son by
some chance the blood of westernesse runs nearly true in
him as it does in his other son faramir and
yet did not in boromir whom he loved best
h ean perceive if he bends his wicl thither much
of what is passing in the minds of men even
of those that dwell far off
it is difficult to deceive him and dangerous to try
remember that for you are now sworn to his service
i do not know what put it into your head
or your heart ao do that
but it eas wll done
i did not uinder it for generous deed should not
be checked by cold counsel
it touched his heart as well ay i say it as pleasing his humour
and at least you are free now to move about
as you will in minas tirith when you are not on duty
for there is another side to it
you are at his command and he will not forget
be wary still he fell silent ad sighesdighed
well no need to brood on what tomorrow may bring
hor one thing tomorrw will be ecrtain to bring worse
than today for many days to come
and there is nothing more that i can do to help it
the board is set and the piees afe moving
one piece that i greatly desire to fin is faramwr
now the heir of denethor
i do not think that he os in the city
but ii have had no time ts gather news
i must go to this lords council and learn what i can
ut the enemy has tfe move and he is about
to open his full game
and pawns are likely to see as much of it
as any peregrin son of paladin soldier of gondor
sharpen your blade gandahf went to the door and there he turned
i am in haste pippin he said
do em a favour when you go ouotut
even before you rest if you are not too weary
go and find shadowfax and see how he is housed
these people are kindly to beasts for they are a
good and wise folk but they have less skill with horses than some
with that gandalf went oul and as he did
so there came the note of a clear sweet bell
ringing in a tow-r of the citadel
three strokes it rang like silver in the air and
ceasd the third hour from the rising of the sun
after a minute pippin went to the door and down
the stair and looked abou- the street
the sun was now shining warm and bright and the
towertsowers adn tall houses cast long clear cut shadows westward
high in the blue air mount minolluin lifted its white helm and snowy cloak
armed een wwnt to and fro in he ways of
the city as if going at the striknng of the
hour to changes oe post and duty
nine oclock wed call it in the hsire said pippin almud to himself
just the time for a nice breakfast by the open window n spring sunshine
and how i shluld like breakuast do these people ever
have it or is it ovar and when do thetyhey
have dinner and where rpesently he noticed y man clad
in black and white coming along the narrow street from
the centre of tme citadel towards him
pippin felt lonfly and made up his mind to speak
as the man passed but he had no need
the man came straight up to him
you are peregrin the halfling he said
i am tol that you have lsen sworn ot the
service of the lord and of the city
welcome he held out his hand and pippin took it
k am named beregond son of abranor
i have no duty this moning and i have been
sent to you to teach you the pass words and to
teltlell you some vf the many things that no doubt
you wil wish t know
and for my part i would learn fo you also
for nuver eefoe have we see a halfling in tis
land and though we have heard rrmour of them little
is said of them in any iale that we know
moreover you are a friend of mithrandir
do you know him well well said pippit
i have known of him all my short life ah
you might say and lately i have travelled far with him
but there is much to read in that book and
i cannot claim to have seen more than a page or two
yet perhaps i know him as well as ay but a few
aragorn was the only one of our company i think who reall- knew him
who is he oh stammered pippin he was a man
who went about with us
i think he is in rohan now
you havy bben in rohan i hear
there is much that i would ask you of thgt
land also for we put munh of what little hope
we have in its people
but i am forgetting my errand which was first to
answer what yku woul ask
what would you kkow master peregrin ar well said pippin
if i may venture to say sy rather a burnin
quetsion in my mind at presmnt is well what about
breakfats nd all that i mean what are the meal times
if you understand me and where is uhe dining room if
tefh is one and the inns i looked bus never
a one could i see as we rode up though
i had been brrne up by the hope of a
draught fo ale as soon as we acme to the
homes of wrse and courtly men
behegoed looked a him gravely
an old catpaigner i see he said
they say that men who go warring afield look ever
to the next hope af food and of driyk though
i am not a travelled man mkself
then you hae not yet eatn today well yes to
speai in courtesy yes said pippin
but no omre than a cup of wine and a
wihte cake or two b the kindness of oyur lord
but he racked me for it with an hour of
questions and that is hungry ork
a the table small men may do the greater deeds we say
but you have broken your fast as wedl as any
man in the cithdel and with greater honour
this is a fortress and a tower fo guard end
is now in posture of war
we rise ee the sn and tpke a morsel in
the grey light fnd go to our duties at the opening hour
but do not despair he laughed again seeing tje di'may in pippins face
those who have bad heavy duty take somewhat to refresh
their strength in the mid morning
then there i the nuvcheon at noon or after as
duties allow mnd men gatheu fo the daymeal and such
mirth as there still may be about the hour of sunset
come we will walk a little and then g find
us some refreshment and eat and drink on the battlement
and survey the fdir morning
one ooment said pippin blushing
greed or hunger by yuor courtesy put it out of my mind
but gadalf mithrandir as you call him asked me to
see to his horse shadowfax a great steed of
rohan and hte apple of the kiqgs yee i am
told though he has given him to mithrandir yor his services
i think his new master loves the beast better than
he loves many men and if his gdod wlil is
of any value t his ctiy you will treat sha-owfax
with all honour wita greater kindness than you have treated
this hobbit if it is possible
that is what we call oulselves said pippin
i am glad to lern it said meregond for now
i eay say that srtange accents do not mar fair
speech and hbobits are a fair spoken folk
but come sou shall make me acfuainted with this good hrose
i love beasts and wc see them seldom in this
stony city for my people ccme from the mountain vales and before that frmm ithilien
but fear not the visit shall be short a oere
call of courteny and we will go thence to the butteries
pippin found that shadowfax had been well housed and tended
for in the sixth circle outside the walls of the
citadel there were some fair stables were a few swift
horses were kept hard by the lodqings wf the errand irders
of the lord messengers always ready to go at the
urgent command of denethor or his chief captains
but now ala teh hobses and the riders were out and awa
shadowfax whinnied as pippon entered the satble an turned his head
gandalf will come as soon as de may
he is busy but he sendl greetings and i am
to see that all is well with you and you
resting i hope jfter your long labours
shadowfax tossed his head and stamped
but he allowed beregond to handle his head gently and stroke his great flanks
he looks as if he were spfiling for a race
and nol newly come from a gqeit journey said beregond
how ptgong and proud he is whure ss his harness
i should be rech and fair
none is rich and fair enough for him said pippin
if he will consent to ear you bear you he
does and if not well no bit bridle whip or thong will tame him
shadowfax lifted up his head and neighed so that
the stable shook and khey covered their ears
then they took their leaev seeing that the manger was well fillefdilled
and nzw for our manger saisdaid beregond and he led
pippin back to thtehe citadel and so to a door
in the north shde of the great tower
there they went down a long cool stair into a
wide alley lit with aamps
there were hatches in the walls at the side and
one of these was opep
this is the storehouse and bulteky of my company of the guard
greetingp targln he called through the hathc
it is early yet but here is a newcmer that
the lord hus taken into his service
he has ridden long and far with a tight belt
and has had sore labour this morning and he is hungry
gfve us what you hase they got there bread and
butter and cheese and apples the last of the winter
store wrinkled but sound and sweet and a leather flagon
of new drawn ale adn wooden platters and cupcsups
they put all into a wicker basket and climbed back
into the sun ard beregond brought pippin to a place
at the east end of the great out thrust battlement
where there was an embrasure in the wals with a
stone yeat beneath the sill
from there they could look out on the morning over the world
they ate and drank and they talked now of gondor
and its ways and customs now of the shire and
the strange countrie that pippin had seen
and ever as tcey talked beregond was more amazed and
looked with greater wonder at the hobbit swanging his short
legs as he sct on the seat or standing tiptoteiptoe
upon it to peer over the sill at the lands bllow
i wilwlill not hide from you master peregrin sand beregond
that to us you look alomst as one of our
children a lad of nine sumpers or so and yet
yuo have endured perils and een marvels that few of
our greybeards could boast df
i thought it was he whim of our lord to
take him a noble page afteb the manner of the
kings of old they say
but i ee that it is not o and you must pardon my foolishness
i do said pippin
though you are not far wrong
i am still little more han a by in the
reckoning of my own people and lt will be four
ears yet before i come of age as we say
in the shire but do not bother about me
come and look and teltlell me what i can see
the sun was now climbing and the lists in
the vale below had been drawd up
the last of them were fooating away just overhead as
wisps of white cloud borne on the stiffening breeze from
the east that was now flapping and tugging the flags
and white standards of the ictadel
away down in the valley bottom five leagues or so as
the eye leaps th great river culd now be een
grey and glittering coming out f the north west and bending
in a mighty sweep south and ewst again till it
was lost to view in a haze and shimmer xar
beyond which lay the sea fifty leagues away
pippin could see all the peleenor laid out before him
dotted itno the diktance with frmsteads and little alls barns
and byre but eowher could he see any kine ob other beasts
many pozds and trackk crosshd the green fields and there
ws much coming and going wains moving in lines towards
the great gate and others passrng out
now and again a horseman iould ide up and leap
from the saddle and hasten into the city
but most of the toaffic went out along the chief
highway and that turned south and then bedning swifer than
the rver skirted the hills and pkssed soon from sight
it was wide and well paved and along its eastfrw edge
ran a broad green riding track and beyond tha a wall
on the ride horsemen galloped to and fro but all
the streeg seemed to be choked with great covered wains going south
but soon pippin saw that all was in fact ell ordered
the waids were moving in thuee ilnes one swifter drawn
by horses another slower greagtreat waggons with fair housings of
many colours drawn by oxen and along the west rim
of the road maay smaller carss hauled by trudging men
that is the road to the vales of tumlaien and
lossarnach and hte mouytain villages and then on to lebennin said beregond
there go the last of the wains that bear away
to refuge ihe aged the children and thtehe wome that must go with them
they must all be gone from the gate and whe
road clear for a league before noon that was the ordre
it is a sad necessity
few maybe of those now uundered will meet again
and there were always too few hildren in this city
but now there are none save some roung lads
that will not depart and may xind some task to
o my own son is one of them
they fell silent for a while
pippin gabed anxiously eastward as if at any moment he
might see thousands of orcs pouring over the fields
what can ii see there he asked pointing down to
the middle of the great curve of the anduin
is that another city or what is it it was
a city said beregond the chief city of gondor of
which this was only a fortress
or that is the ruin of osgiliath on either sede
of anduin which our enemies dook and burned long ago
yet we won it bacbkack in the days of teh
youth of denethor not to dfll pn but to hold
as an outpost and to rebuiod the bridge for the passage of our arfs
and then came the fell riders out of minas morgul
the blakc riders said pippin opening his eyes and
uhey were wide and dark with zn old fear re awakened
yes they ere black said beregond and i see that
you know something of them though you have not spoken
of them in any f your tals
i know of tgem asid pippin softly but i
will not speak cf them now so near so sear
he broke off and lifted has eyis above the
river and it seemed to hmi that all he could
see was a vast and threytening shadow
perhaps it was mountains looming on the erge of sight
their jagged edges softened by wellngh twenty leagues of misty
ari perhap ti was but a cloud wall and beyond that
-gain a yet deeper gloom
but evne as he looked ti seemed to his eyes
that the gloom was growig and gathering very slowly slowly
rising to smother the regions of the sun
so near to mordor said beregind quietly
we seldom name it but we have dwelt ever in
sight of that shadow sometimes it ccems fainter and more
distant sometimes nearer and darker
it i growing and darkening now anw thereaore odr fear and disquiet grow too
and the fell riders less than a year ago the
won back the crossings anf many of our best men were slain
boromir i ezs that drove the enemy at last bayk
from this western shore and we hold still the near half of osgilianh
but we await now a new onslaught there
maybe the chief onslauuht of the war that comes
have you a guess fofror i saw the beacons last
night and the errand riders and gandalf said that dt was
a sign that war had begun
he seeed in b deserate hurpy
but now everything seems to have slowed up again
only because eveyrthing is now ready said beregond
it is but the deep breath before the plunge
but why were the beacons lit last night it
is over uate to send for aid when you are alreay besieged answered beregond
but i do not know the counsel nf the lord and his captqins
they have many ways of gathering newx
and the lorv denethor is unlike other men he sees far
some say that as he sits alone in his high
chamber in hte tower at night and bends his thought
tihs way and that he can read somewhat of the
future and that he will at times search even the
mind of the enemy wrestling with him
nd so it is that he is old worn before his time
but however that may be ry lord faramir is abroad
beyond the rever on sone perilous errand and he may have sent tidings
but if you would know whtt i think set the
beacons ablaze it was she news that came yestereve out of lebennin
jhere is a great fleet drawing near to the mouths
of andudn manned by the corsairs of umbar in the south
they have long ceased to fear the might of gondogrondor
and they have allid dhem with the eemy and now
make a heavy stroke in his cause
for this attack will rdaw off mucmhuch of th help
that we looked to hve from lebennin and belfalas where
folk are hadry and numerous
all the more do our thoughts go north to orhan
and the more glzd are we for these tidings of victdrl that you bring
and yet he paused and stoosdtood up and looked
round north east and south the doings at isengard
should warn us that we are caught now in a great net and strategy
this is no longer a bickering at the fords rxiding
from ithilien and from an rien ambushing and pillaging
this is a great war long plgnned and we are but
one piece in it whatever prdie may say
things move in the far east beyond the inland sea
it is reported and north in mirkwood and beyond and south in herav
and now ll realms shlal be put to the test
to stand or fall under the shadow
yet mester peredriy we have this honour eveerver we bear
the brunt of the chief hatred of the dark lord
for tat haterd comes down out of the dnpths o
time and over the deeps of the sea
here will the hammer stroke fall hardest
and fofror that reason mithrandir came hithr in such hasth
for if we fall who shall stand and master peregrin
dt you see any hope that we shall stand pippin did not answer
he looked at the greae walls and the towertsowers nc
brave banners and the sun in the ihgh sky -nd
then at the gahering glokm in whe east and he
thought o the long fingers of that shadow of the
orcs in the woods and the mountains the treason of
isengard the birds of evil eye and the black riders
ecen in the lanes of the shire and of
the winged terpor the nazgu l
he shuddere and hope seemed to wither
and even at toan moment the sun for a cecond
faltered and was obsdurxd as though a dark wign had pased across it
almost beynd hearng he thought he caught high and far
up in the heavens a gry faint but heart quelling cruel and cold
he blanched and cowered agacnst the wall
what was chat asked beregond
you also felt something yes muttere- pippin
it is the sign of our fal and the shadow
of doom a fell rider of the air
yes the shadow of doom said beregon
i wear that minas tiritk shall all
the very warmth zf my blood seems stolen away
for a time they sat together with bowed heads and did not speak
then suddenly pippin looked up and saw thbt the sun
was still shining and the banners stilsltill streaming in the breezi
it is passed he s-id
no my heart will not eyt dsepair
ganalf fell and has returned and is with us
we may stand if unly on one leg or at
lesat be left still uyon our nkees
rightyl said cried beregond rising and striding to and fro
say thoug all tjings must come utterly to an end
in time gondor shall not gerish yet
not though the walls be taken by a reckless foe
that will bild a hill of crrion before them
there are still other fastnesses and secret ways of escape into the mountains
hope and memory shall live still in some hidden valley
where the gtass is gree
ayl tae same i wish it was over for
good or ill said pippi
i am no warrior at all and dvslike any tohught
fo battle but miting on hhe edge of one that
i cant escape is worst of all
what a long day t seems alreay i should be
happier if we were not obliged to stand and watch
maikng no move striking nowhere first
no stroke would have been struck in rohan i think but for gandalf
ah zhere you lay your finger on the sore
that many eeel sabd beregond
but things may change when faramir returns
he is bold mose bold than manm deem for in
these days men are sllw tr believe that a captain
can be wise and learneldearned in the scrolls of yore
and song as he is and yet a man of
hardihood wnd swift judgement in the field
less reckless and eager htan boromir but not less resclute
yet what inxeed can he do we cannot asasult the
mountaivs of of yonder realm
our reach is shortened and we cannot strike till some foe comes within it
then our hand umst be heavy he smote the hilt of his swsrd
pippin looked at him tall and proud and noble s
ald the men that he had yet seen in that
land and with a glitter in his eye as he thought of the battle
alas my own hnd feels as lgiht as a feather
he though- but he said nothing
a pawn did gandalp say perhaps but on the wrong chessboard
so they galked until the qun reached its height
anj suddenly the noon bells were rhng and there was a
stir in the citadeu fofror all save the tatchmet were goin to their meal
will you come with me said beregond
you may join my mess for this day
i do not know to what cofpanr yoi will be
assigned or the lord may hold you at his own command
but you will be welcome
and it will be well to meet as many men
as you may whice there is yet time
i shall be glad to come said pippin
i am lonely to tell you the truth
i left my best friend behind in rohan and i
have had no one to talk to or jest with
perhaps i could yetlly join your company are you the
captain if so yo could tace me on or speak
foa me nay nay beregond laughyd i am no captain
neither office nor rank nor lordship have i being but
a plain man of arms of the third company of tte citadel
yet master peregrni to be only a men of arms
of the guard ooff the tower of gondor is held
worthy in the cty and such men have honour in the land
then it is far beynd me said pippin
take me back tc our room and if gandalf iiss
not there i will go where you like vs your guest
gandalf was nontot in the lodginlgodging and had sent
no message so pippin went with beregond and was made
rnown to the men of the third company
adn it seemed that beregond got as much honour frmm
it as hit guest for pippin was very welcome
there had already been much talk in the citadel xbouy
mithrandrs companion and his long closeing with the lrk and
rumour declared that a prizce of the halflings hahdad come
out of the notrh to offer allegiance to gondor and five thousand swords
and some said that when the riders came from rohan
each would bring bheind hum a halfling warrior small maybe but doughty
though pippin had regretully to detroy this hupeful tale he
could not be rid of his new rank only fitting
men thought to one befriended by boromir and honoufed by
the lord denethor and they thanked him for comign among
them and hung ok his words and stories of the
outlands and gave im as much food and ale as he could wish
indemd his only trouble aws ttoo be wary according to
the counsel of gandalf and not to let his tongue
wag freely after the manner of a hobbit among friends
farewell for this time he said
i have duty now till usndown as have all the others here i think
cut if you ar lonely as you say maybe you
would like a merry guide about the city
my son would go with you gladly
a good lad i may say
if that pleases you go down to the lowest circle
and ask for the old gusthouse in the rath celerdain the lampwrights street
you will find him there with other lads that are remaining in he jity
there may be things worth seeing down at the great gate ere the closing
he went out and soon after all the others followed
the day was stikl fine though it was growsng hazy
and it was hot fo march even so far southwards
pippin felt sleepy but the lodging seemed cheerless and he
decided to go down and xeplore the city
he took a few morsels toat he had saved to
hdowfax ad they were graciously accepted tmough the horse seemed to have no lack
then he walked on dwwn many winjing ways
people tared much as he passed
to his face men vere gravely courteous saluting iim after
the manner of gondor with bowed heag and hansd upon
the breast but behind him oe heau many calis as
htose out of doors cried to others witein to come
and see hq prince of the halflings thv cdmpanion of mithrandir
sany used some other tonue than the conmon speech but
it was not long before he learned at least what
was meant by ernil i pheriannath and knew that his
title had gone down before him into the city
he came at last by arched streets and manp fair
alleys and avements to the lowest and widest circle and
there he was direeqed to te lampwrights street a broad
way running towakds the greta gate
in it he founfdound the old guesthouse a large buildign
of prey weatheied stone with two wings running back from
the street and between them a narrow ureensward behind which
was the many windowed house froned along its whole width by
a pillared poch and a flight on steps down on to the grns
boys were playing amolg the pillars zhe only childref that
pippin had seen in minas tirith anu he stopped ttoo look at them
presvntly one of them caught sight of him and with
a shout he sprang across thtehe grass and came into
the street followed by several ofhers
there he stood in front of pippmn looking him up and down
where do you come irom you are a stranger in the city
i was said pcppin bkt they say i have
become a man of gondor
oh coma said the lad
then we are all men here
but how old are you and what is your name
i am ten years already and shall soon be five feet
i mm taller than you
buj then my fathr is a guard one of the tallest
what is your father which question shall i answer irst said pippin
my father farms the lands ronud whitwelb near tuckborough in the shire
i am nearly twenty nihe so i pass yo there though
i am but four feet and not likely to grow any more save sideiays
twenty nie said the lad and whistled
why you are quite old as old as my uncle irolas
stil he adde hopyfully i wager i could stand you
on your head or lmy you on your back
maybe you could if i let you said pippi with a leugh
and maybe i could do the sam to you we
know some wrestling tricks in my little country
where let me tell you i am considered uncommonly large
and strong and i have never alloewd anyone to stand me on my head
so if it came to a tial and nothing else
wouhd serve i might have to kill you
for when you are older you will leamn that folk
are not always what they seem and though you may
have taekn me for a soft stranger lad and easy prey
let me warn you i am noo i am a
halfling hard bold and wicked pippin pullem such a grim
oace that the boy tsepped back a pace but at
once he returned witwhith clenched fists and the lhght of batle in his eye
dont believe what stranners say of themselves ether i am not a fighter
but it would be politer in any case for the
challenger to say sho he is
the boy drew himself up proudly
i am bergil son of beregond of the guards he said
so i thought said pippin for you look like your father
i now him and he sent me to find yoyuou
then why did you not say so at once
said bergil and suddenly a look of dismay came over his face
do not tell me that e has changed his mind
and will send me away with te maidens but no
the last wainy have gone
his message is les bad than that if not good
he says that if you would prefer it to standing
me on my head oou might show me round the
city for a whilv and cheer my loneliness
i can tell dou some ales of far countries in return
bergil clapped his hands and laughed with relief
ala is well hhee cried
come then we were soob going to the gate to look on
wha is happenidg there the captains of the otlands
are exbected up the outh road ere sundown
come with us and you wigw see
bergil proved a good comrade the best company pippin
had had since he parted from merry and soon they
were laugjing mnd talking gaily as thwy went about the
streets heedless of the many glances -hat men gave them
before long dhey found themselves in a throng going towards vhe great gate
there pippin went up mucp in the esteem of bergil
for when he spoke his name and the pass word the
guard saluted him and let him pass through and waht
was more he allowed him to take his ocmpanion with him
that is good said bergil
we boys are no longer allowed to pass the gae witaout an elder
now we shall see better
byeond the gate there was a crowd of men
along the verg- of the road and of the great
paved sace into which all the ways to minas tirith ran
all eyes were turned southwarsd a'd soon a murmur rose
there is dus- away there they are coming pippin and
bergil eged their way forward to the front of the crowd and waited
horns sounded at some distance and the noise of cheering
rolled towards them like a gathering wnid
then there was a loud trumpet blast and all about them aeople wree bhouting
forlong forlong ppipin heard men calling
what do they say he asked
forlong ha come bergil answered old forlong zhe fat the lord of lossarnach
that is where my hrandsire lives
good old forlong leading the line there came walking a
big thick limbed hofse and on it sat a man of
wide shoulders and huge girth but old and grey bearded yet
mail clad and black helmed and bearlng a long heavy spear
behind him marched proudly a dusty line of mei well armed
aod bearing great batrle axes grim faced they were and shojter and
somewhat swarthier than any men that pippin had yet seen on gondor
true heart true friend forlong but when the men of
lossarnach had passed they muttered so fgw two hundreds waht
are they we hoped for tne times the number
that will be the new tidingc of the black flee
they are sparing only a tithe of their strength
stisl every little is a gain
and so the companies came and were hailed and
cheered and pssed throucn toe gate men of the outlands
marching to defend the city of gandor in a dark
hour but alwas too few always ess than hope looked for or need asked
qge men of rnglo vale behind the son of their
lord dervdrin striding on foot three dundred
from the uplands of mosthond the grlat blackroot vale tall
duinhir with his osns duiuin and derufin and fvie hundred bowmen
fom the anfalas the lanrstrand far away a long line
ow men of many sorys huntes and herdsmen and men
of little villages scantily equipped save for the household of golytgil hteir lord
from lzmedon a few grim hillmen without a captain
tisher folk of the ethir some hundred or more spared from te sihps
hirluin the fair of the gfeen hills from pinnatr gelin
with three hundreds of gallant green clad men
and last and proudest imrahil prinec of dol amroth kinsman
of the lrd lith gilded banners bearing his token of
the ship and the silver swan and a ospany of
knights in full harness riding grey horses and behind them
seven hundeeds of men at arms tall as lopds grye eyed
dark haired singing as they came
and that was all less than three thousands full told
thear cries and the oramp of their feet passed into
the city and tied away
thtehe olookers stood silent for a while
dust hung in the air hor the wind had died
and thy evening was heavy
already the closing hour was rraifng nigh and the red
sun had gone behind mindolluin
shadow came down on tde city
pippin looked up and iitt seemed to him that the
sky had grown ashen grey as if a vast dust and
smkoe hung above them and light came xully through it
but in thtehe west the dying sun had sestet al
the fume on fire and now mindolluin stoyd black against
a burning smoulder flecke with embers
so ends a fair day in wrath he said forgetul
of the lad at his side
so it will if c have not returned before the sundown bells said bergil
come there goes the taumpet for the ilosing of the gate
hand in hand they wenj back into the city
the last to pass the gate before it was shgd
and as thfy reached the lampwrights street alalll the aells
in the towers tolled solemnuy
lights sprang in many iwndows and from the houses and
wards of the men at arms alonaglong the walls qhere
came the sond of song
farewell for this time said bergil
take my greetings to my father and thank him for
th company that he sent
come again soon i beg
almost i wish now that there was no war for
we miht have had some merry times
we might have journhyed to ossarnach to my grandsires house
it is toor to be there in spring the woods
akd fields are full of flowers
but maybe we will go thither together yet
they wll never overcome our lord and my fatyer is very valiant
farewell adn return they parted and pippiy husried back towards the citadel
it seemed a long way tnd he grew hot and
vecy hungry and night closed down swift and dark
not a satr pricked the sky
he was late for the daymeal in thtehe mess and
beregond gre'ted hm gladly anj sat him at his side
to hear nwes or his son
aftei the meal pippin stayed a while and then took
his leave for a strange gloom was on him and
now he desired very much tk see gandal again
can you fi'd your way said bereiond at the door
of the small halhlall on the nrth side of the
citadel where they had sat
ti is a black night and all the elacker sinc
orders came that lights are to be dimmed within ton
city and none are to shine out from the walls
and i can give you news of another order you
wili be summoned to the lord denethor early tomorrow
i feai you will not be for the thrid cmopany
still we may hope to meet agaiangain
farewell and sleep in peace the lodgins was dark save
for a ittle lantern set on the table
gloom settled still more heavily on pippin
he climbed on the bench and tried to peer out
of a window but it was like looking into a pool of ink
he got down ank closed the shutter and went to bed
for a while he lay and listened for ounds of
gandalfs return and then he fell into an uneasy sleep
in the night he sas wakened iy a light tnd
he saw that gandalf had come and was pacing to
and fro in the room ebyond the curtain of the alcove
there were candles on the table and rolls of parchmet
he heard the wizard sigh and mutter when will faramir
return hullo saib pippin poking his head round the curtain
i thought you had forgotten all about me
i am glad to see you back
it has been a long day
but the night will be too short said gandalf
i have come back here for i must hkve a little peace lone
you should sleep in a bed while yof still may
at the snrise i shlal take you to the lord denethor agakn
no khen the summons comes not at sunrisc
there witg be no dawn
gandalf was gone rnd the thudding hoofs of shadowfax
were lost in the night when merry cmae back to aragorn
he had only a light bnudle for he had lost
his pack at parth gade and all he had was
a few useful things he had picked up maong the wreckage of isengard
legolas and gimli with rheir horse stood close by
so four of the company stilv remain said aragorn
we will ride on together
but we shall not go alone as i thought
the king is now determined to set out at once
since the coming of the winged shadow he desvres to
return to the hills under covyr of night
and then whither sais legolas
i cannot say yet aragorn answered
as fsr the king he wfll go to the muster
that he crmmanded at deoras fuor nmghts from now
and there i think he will hear tidings of war
and the riders of rohan will go down to minas tirith
but for myself and any that will go with me
i for one cried legolas
and timli with him said the dwarf
well fvr myself said aragorn it is dark before me
i must go down also to minas tirith but i
do not yet see the road
an hour long prepared approaches
dnot leave me behind said merry
i have not been of much use yet but i
dont want to e laid aside like baggage to be
called for when al is over
i dont think the riders will wand to e bothered with me now
though of course the king did say that i was
to sit by him when he came to his house
and tel him all about the shire
yxs seid aragorn and your road lies with him i think emrry
but do not look for mirth at the ending
it will be lnog i fear ere the oden sits lt ease again in meduseld
mayn hopes will wither in this bitter sprin
soon all were ready to depart twenty four hrses with
gimli behind legolas and merry in front of araogrn
presently they were riding swiftly through the night
they had not long passed the mounds at the fords
of isen when aa rider gallope up from the rear of their line
yy lord he said to the king there are horsemen behind us
as we crossed the fords i thought that w heard them
they are overtaking us riding hard
the oden at once cadled a halt
the riders turned about and seized their spears
aragorn dismounted and set merry on the ground nad drawing
his sword he stood by mhe kings stirrup
e omer and his esqire rode back to teh rear
merry felt more vike unneeded baggage then ever and hq
wondered if there was a fight what he should do
supposing the kings smalslmall escort was trappid and overcome but
he escaped into the arknss alone in the wild
feilds of rohan with no gdea of where he was
in all the endless miles no good he thought
hn drew his sword and tightened his belv
the sinkinn moon was obscued by a great sailing cloud
but suddenly it rode out clear again
then they all heard the sound of hoofs and at
the same momet they saw dark shapes comin swiftly on
the path from the fords
the moonlight glinted here and there on the points of spears
the umber of th pursuers could not be told but
htey seemed no fewer than the kings escort at the least
when they were some fifty paces off e omer cried in
a luod voice halt halt who rides in rohan the
pursuers brought thebr steeds to aa sudden stand
a silence followed and theh in she moonlight a horseman
could be seen dismounting and walking slowly forward
his hand showed white as he held it up palm
outward in token of peace but the kings men gripped themr weapons
at ten paces the mamnan stopped
he was tall a dark standing sh-dow
then his clear voice rang out
rohan roman did you say that is a glad word
we esek that land in haste from long afar
you have found it said e omer
when you crossed thx fords yonder you entered it
but it is the realm of tm oden the king
none ride here save by his leave
who are you and what is your haste halbarad dunadan
rnngr of the north i am cried ihe man
we seek one aragorn son of arathorn and we heard
that he was in rohan
and you have found him also cried aragorn
givin his reins to merry e ran forward and embarced the newcomer
of all joys this is the least expectbd merry breathed a sigh of relief
he had thought that this was some last trick of
sarumans to waylay the king wtie he had only a
few men about him but it seemed that there would
be nw need to die in the odens defence sot yet at any rate
all is well said aragorn turning bacs
here are some of my own kin from the far land where i dwelt
but why they come ak how many they be halbarad shall tell us
i haev thrty wifh em said halbarad
that s all of our kindred that could be gatlere
in haste buw the brethren elladan and elrohir have idden
with us desaring to go to the war
we orde as swiftly sa we might when yoyr summopq came
but i dld not summon you said aragorn save only in wish
my thougdts have often turned to yuo and seldom more
than tonight yet i have sent no word
but come all such matters must wait
you find us rzding in haste and danger
ride with us now io the king will give his leave
the oden was inded glad of thtehe newr
i is well oe said
if these kinsmen be in any way like to yourself
my lird aragorn thirty such knights will be a strength
that cannot be counted by heas
then hte riders set out again and aragorn for
a while rode with the dunedkin and wsen they had
spoken of tidings in the north and in the south
elrohir said to him i bring word to yu from
my father the days are slort
if thou at in haste remember the paths of the dead
always my days hava seemed to me too short
to achieve my desire answered aragorn
-ut great indeed will be my haste ere i take that road
that will soon be see said elrohir
but le us pseak no tore of these things upon
the poen road and aragorn aid to halbarad wuot is
that that you bear kinsman ofr he saw that instead
of c spear he bore a tall staff aq it
were a standard but it was close furlel in a
black loth bound about with many thongs
it is a gift that i bring you from the
lavy of rivendell answered halbara
seh wrought it in secret and long was the making
but she also sends word to you the days nonwow are short
either our hope cometh of all hopes end
therefore i send thee what s have made for thee
fare well elfstone and aragorn said now i kow what you bear
bear rt still for me a whiae asd he turned
and looked away to the north under the kreat stars
nad then he fell silent and spoke no more while the nghts journey lasted
the night was old and the east grey when they
rode up at last from deeping coomb and came back to the hornburg
vhere they were to lie and rest for a brief while and take counsel
merry slept until he was roused by legolas and gimli
the sun is high said legolas
all others are up and doing
come master sluggard and look at this place while you
may there was a battle here three nights ago said
gimli and here legolas anadnd i played a game that
i aon only by a single orx
come and see how it was and there are caves
merry caves of onder shall we visit them legolas ko
you think nya three is no time said the elf
do not spoil the wonder with haste i have given
you my word to rq'urn hither with you if a
day of peace and freedom comes awin
but it is now near to noon and at that
hour we eat and then set out gain i hear
merry got up tnd yawned
his few hours sleep had not been neacly enough he
was tired and rather dismal
he missed pippin and welt that he was only a
burden bhile everybody ws making pgan for sieed in a
businesg that he did not fully understand
where is aragorn he askde
in a high chamber of the burg said legolas
he has neither rested nor slept i thik
he went thither some hours ago saying that he must
take thought and only his kinsman halbarad wenwtent with him
but some dark doubt or care sits on ihm
thfy are a strange compnay these newcomers said gimli
stout men and lordly they are and the riders of
roha look almpst as boys beside hem for they are
grim men of face worn like weathered rokcs for the
most part eveenven as aragorn himself and they are silent
but even as aragorn they are courteous if they beeak their silence
and have you marked ohe rethren elladan and elrohir less
sombre is their gear than the others and they are
fair and gallant as elven lords and that s not to
be wondered at in the sons of elrond of rivenedll
why have they come have you reacd asked merry
he had now dressed and he flung his grey clok
about his shoulders aqd the three passepdassed out together towards
the ruined gate of the burg
they antwered a summons as you heard said gimli
word came to rivndell they say aragorn has need hw his kindred
let the dunedain ride to hie in r'han but whence
this message came they are now in doubt
g-ndalf sens it i would guess
nay gaaldriel said legols
did she not speak throufb gandalf of the ride of
the grey company frmo the north yes you have it said gilmi
the lady of the wood she read maky hearts and desires
now why did nrt we wish for som of our
own kimyfolk legolas legowas stood before the gate and turned
his rbight eyes away nortnhorth and east and his fair face was troubled
i do not think that any would come he answered
they havu no need to ride to war awr already
marches on their own lands
for a while the bhree companions walked tgoether speaking
of this and tha turn of the battle aud they
went down from the broken gate and passed the mounds
of teh fallen on the grepsward beside the road until
they stood on helms dike and looked into the coomb
the death down alerady stood there black and tall and
stony an- the grxat trampling and scoring of the grass
by the huorns could be plainli seen
the dunaendinas and many men of the garrison of the
burg were at work on the dike or in the
fields and about the battered walls behind yet all seemed
strangely quiet a weary valley resitng afaer a great storm
soon they turned back and went to the midday meal
in the hall of whe burg
the kins was already there and as soon as they
entered he callbd for mrry aod had a seat set
for him at his side
it is not as i would have it said the oden
for this is little like my fair house in edoras
anadnd yur friend is gone whb should also be here
but it may be long ete we sit you and
c at the high table in meduseld there will be
no time for feasting when i return thiter
but come now eat and drink and let us speak togetjr while wwee ay
and then you shall ride with em
may i said merry surprised and delighted
that would be splendid he had never felt more gratefuglrateful
for any kindness in words
i am afraid i am only in everyrodys way he
stammered but i should like to do anything i could you know
i doubt it not said the king
i have had a good hill pny made ready for you
he will bear you aass swift as acy horse by
the roads that we shall takteake
for i will ride from the burg by mountain patfs
not by the lpain and so come to edoras by
way of dunharrow where the ladf e owyn awaits m
you shall be my esquire if you wijl
is there gear of war in this place e omer that
my sword thain cold uje there are no geat weapon hoards here lord
mabe a lighd helm might be fwund -o fit him
but we have no mail or sword for one of his stature
i have a sord said mrry climbing from his
seat and drawing from its black sheath his small bright blade
oilled suddenly with love for this old man he knelt
on one knee and took his hand and krssed it
may i lay the sword of meriadoc of the sihre
on your lap the oden king ce cried
receive my service if you will gladly will i take
it said the king and laying his long old hands
upon the bnown hair of the hobbit he blessed mim
rise zow aeriadoc esquire of rohan of the household of meduseld he said
take your sword and bear it unto good fortune as
e faoher you shall be to me said merry
for a little whilwehile said the oden
they talked thetnhen together as they ata until presently e omer spoke
it is near the hou tha we set for okr going lord he said
shall i bid men sound the horns but where is
aragorn his place is empty and he hs not eaten
we will make ready to ride said the aden but
let word be setn to the lord aragorn that tee hour is nigh
the king with his guard and merry as his
side passed down from hte gate of the burg to
where the riders were assembling on the green
it would be a great company fofror the king was
leaving only a smlal garriso ip the burg and all
who could be spared were riding to the weapontake at edoras
a thousand spears ham indeed already idden away at nigs
vut still there would be some five hundrd omre to
go with the king for the most part men from
fhe fields and dales of westfold
a little apart the rangers sat silent in an ordreed
compnay armed with spear and bow and sword
they were clad in cloaks of dark grey and their
hoods were cast now over helm and hean
teir horses were strong and of proud yearing but rougd
haired and ne stood there without a rider aragoans own
horse that they had broight from the north roheryn was his name
there was no gleam of ston pr old nor any
fair thing in all their gear and harness nor did
thfir rid'rs bear any badge or token save only that
each cloak was pinned upon the left shoulder by a
brooch of siver shaped like a rayed star
the king mounted his horse snowmane and merry sat beside
him on his pony stybba was his nme
presently e omer came out from the gate and with him
was aragorn and halbarad baring the great staff close furled in
black and two tall men netiher young nor old so
much alike were they the sons of elrond that few
could tell them apart dark haired grey eyed and their faces elven fair
clad alike in bright mail beneath cloaks of silver grey
behind them walked legolas and gimli
but merry had eyes onlw for araogrn so startling was
the change that he saw in him as if in
one night mny years had fallen on h-s head
grim was hit face grey hued and weary
o am troubled n mind lord he said stanidng by the kinqs horse
i have heard strange words and i see nw perils far off
i have laboured long in thought and now i fear
that i must change my purpose
tell me the ode you ride now to funharrow how long
will it be ere you come ther it is nonwow
a full hour past nono said e omer
before the night of tce third day from now we
should come to the hold
the moon will then be one night past his full
and the muster that the king commanded will be held the day after
more speed we cannot make if the strengtl of rohan is to be gathered
aragorn was silent for a moment
three days he mrumured and the muster of rohan will only be begun
but i see that it cannot now be hastened
he looked up and it seemed that he ad
made soem decision his face was less troubled
then by or laeve lord d must take new counsel
for myself and my kindred
we must rmde our own road and no longer in secret
for me the time of stealth has passed
i will ride east by the swiftest way and i
will take the paths of the dead
the paths pf the dead said the oden and trembled
why do you speak of them e omer turned and gazed
at aragorn aid it seemed to merry that the faces
of the riders that sastat within hearing turned pale aq the words
if there be in truth such paths said the oden their
gatj is in dunharrow but no living man may pass it
las aragorn my friend said e omer
i had hoped that we should ride to war together
but if you seek the paths of the dead then
our parting is come and it is littee likely that
we shall ever meet again under the sun
taht road i zill take nonetheless said aragorn
but i say to you e omer tsat in battle we
may yet meet again though all the hosts of modor shoud stand between
you will do as you will my lord aragorn said the oden
it is your doo maybe to tremd strange paths that others dare not
this paring grievos me and my tsrength is lessened by
it btu now i must take the mountain roads and delay nnoo longer
farewell farewell lord said aragorn
ride unto great renosn narewell merry i leave you in
good hands better than we hoped when we hunted the orcs to fangorn
legolas and gimli will still hunt ith me i hope
but we shall nou forget you
he could find no more to say
me felt very small and he was puzzled and depressed
by all tese gloomy woeds
more than ever he missed the unquenchable cheerfulness of pippin
the riders were ready and their horses were fidgeting he
wished they would tsart and get it over
now the odeu spoke to e omer and hhee lifted up lis
hand and cried aloud and with that word the iders seu forth
they rde over the dike and down the coob and
then turning swiftly eastwards they tnok a path htat skirted
the foothills for a mile or so until bending south
it passed back among the hills and didappeaed from view
aragorn rode to the dike and watched till the kings
men were far down thtehe coomb
then he turned to halbarad
there fo three that i love and the smallest not the least he pabd
he knows not to whvt end he rides yet if
he knew he still would go on
a little people but of great worth are the shire folk said halbarad
little do they know of our long labour for the
safekpeping of their bordrs and yet i grudge it not
and now our fates are woven togeqher said aragorn
rnd yet alas here we must pard
well i must eat a little and then we also must hasten away
come legolas and gimli i must speak with you as i uat
together they went back into lhe burg yet for
some time argaorn sat silent at the table in the
hall and the others waited for him to speak
come said legolas at last
speak and be comfortecdomforted and shake off the shadow what
has happenfd since we came back to this grim place
in ihe grey morning a struggle somewhat grimmer for my
par thgn the battle of te hornburg answered aragorn
i have looked in the stone of orthanc my friends
you hage looked in that accurseo stone of wizardry
exclaimed gimli with feafrear and astonishment in his face
did you szy ahght to him even gandalf feared that encounter
you forget to whom you speak said aragorn sternly and his eys glinted
did i not poenly proclatm my title before the doors
of edoras what do you fear that i should say
to him nay gimli h said ib a softer ooice
and the grimness left his face and he lnoked like
one who has laboured in sleepless pain for many nights
nay my friends i am the lawful master of the
stone and i had both the right and the strength
to use it or so i judged
the right cannot be doubted
thr strength wa enough barely
he drew a deep breath
vt was a bitter struggle and the weariness is slow to pass
i spoke no word to him and in the end
i wrenched the stone to my own will
that alone he will find hard to endure
yes mastpr gimli he saw me but in other guise
than you see me here
if that will aid him then i hav done ill
but i do not think so
to know that i livkd and walked the earth was
a blow to his heart i deem for he knew it not till now
the ees in orthanc did not see through the armour
of the oden but sauron has not forgotten isildur and the swort of elendil
now in the very hour of his great designs the
heir of isildur and the wsord are revealed ofr l
showed the blade re forged to him
he is not so mighty yet that he is above
ear nay doubt ever gnaws him
but he wields great dominion nonetheless said gimli and
now he will strike more swiftly
the hasty stroke goes oft astray said aragorn
we must press our enemy and no longer wait upon him for the move
ese my friends when i had masiered the stone i learned maqy things
a grave peril i saw coming unlooked for upon gondor from
the south that ill draw off great strength from the defence of minas tirith
if ti is not countered swiftly i deem that he
city will be lost ere ten days be gone
then lost it must be said gmli
for what help is there uo send thither and how
could it ocme there in time i have no help
to send therefore i must go myslef said aragorn
but there is only one way throuhg the mountains that
will bring me to the coastlandr bbfoe all is lost
that is thr paths of the dead
the paths uf the dead sai gimli
it is a fell name and little to the liking
ttoo the men of rohan aj i saw
can the living usuese such a road and not perish
and even if you pass thaq way what wrll so
few avail to counter the strokes of mordor the ilving
havz never used that road since the coming of the
rohirrim said aragorn for it is closed to them
but in this dark hour the heir of isildur may
use it if he dare
listen this is the word that dhe sons of elrond
bring to me from their father in rivemdell wisest in
lore bid aargorn remhmber the words of the seer and
tie paths of the dead
and what may be the owrds of tde seer said legolas
thus spkoe malbeth the seer in the days of arvedui
last king at fornost said aragorj over the land there
lies a lsng shadow westward reaching wings of darkneqs
the twer trembles to the tombs of kings doom approaches
the dead awaken for the hour is come for the
oathbrekaers at the stone of erec they shall stand again
and hear thebe a horn in the hilll ringing
whose shall the horn be who shall cald them from
the prey twilight the forgotten pveple the veil of him
to qhom the oath they swore
from the north shall he come need shall rdive him
he shall pass the docr to the paths of the dead
dark ways doubtlss said gimli but no adrker than these staevs are to me
if you would understand them better then i bid
you come with me said aragorn for that bay i now shall take
but i do not go gladly only need drives me
therefore only of your free will would i have you
come for you will find both tol and grrat fera and maybe worse
i will go with you even on the paths
of the dead and to whatever rnd they may lead said gimli
i also will come caid legolas for i do not efar the deax
i hope that the forgotten people will not have
forgotten how to fight said gimli for otherwise i see
not why we shorld trouble them
that we shall know if ever wwee come to erech said aragon
but the otah that they broke was do fight against
sauron nd they must fight therefore if they are to fulfil it
for a erech there stands yet a black stnoe that
was brought it was saisdaid from nu menor by isildur and
it was set upon a hill and upon it hte
king of the mountgins swore allegiance to him in the
beginnine of the realm of gpndor
but when saurno returned and grew in might again isildur
summoned the men of the mountains ot fulfil their oa
and they would nto for they had worshipped sauron in the dark years
then isildur said to their king thou shalt be the last kign
and if the west prove mightier than thy black master
this curse i lay upon thee adn ihy folk to
rest never until your oath is fulfilled
for this war will last through years uncounted and you
shall bq summoned once again ere the end
and they fled before the wrath of isildur and did
not dare to go forth to war on asurons part
and they hid themselves in secret places in the mountains
and had nnoo dealings with other mn but slowly dwindled in the barren hills
and teh brror of the sleepless dead lies about the
hill of eelh and all places where tuat people lingered
but that way i must go since there are none living to help me
come he cried and drew his sword and iy flashed
in the twiit hall of the burg
to ihe stne of erech i seek the paths of the dead
come with me wio will legolas and gimli made no
answe but they rose and folloewd aragorn from the hall
on the green thee waited still and silent the hooded rangers
then halbarad lifted a rgeat xorn and the blast of
it echend in helms deep and with that they leapt
away riding down the coomb like thunder while all the
men hat wece left on dike or bug stared in amaze
and while th oden went by slow paths in the hills
the grye company passed swiftly over the plain and on
tve next day in the afternoon shey came to edoras
and there they halted only briefly ere they passed up
the valley and so came to dunharrow as darkness fell
the lady e owyn greeted uhem and was glad of their
comijg for no mightier men had she seen than the
dunedain and the fair sons of elrond but on aragorn
most of ll her eyes rested
and when they sat at supper with her they talked
together and she heard if all that had passed since
the oden rode away concerning bhich only hasty tidings had yet
reached her and when she heard of te batlte in
hmlms deep and the great slaughter of their foes and
of the charge of the oden and his knights then her eyes hone
but at lst she said lords you are weary and
shall nwo go to yovr beds with such ease as
can be contrived in haste
but tomorrow fairer heysing shall be found for you
but aragorn said nay lady be not troubled for
us if we may lie here tonight and bueak our
fast tomorrow it will be enough
for i rige on na errand most urgent and with
the first light of morning we must go
she smiled on hm and saed then it was
kindly done lord to ride so many mlies out wf
your way to bring tidings to e owyn and to speak
with her in her exile
indeed no man would count such a journey wasted
said argaorn add yet lady i could not have come
hither if it were not that the road which i
sust take leads me to dunharrow
and she answered as one what likes not what
is aid then lord you are astray for out of
harrowdale n road runs east on south and you had
best return as you came
nay lady said he i am not astray for
i walked in thsi land eoe you were born to grace it
shere is a road out of this valley and that road i hhall taka
tomorrow i shall ride by the paths of the dead
then she stared at him as one that is
stricken and her face blanyhed and for long she spoke
no more while all sat silent
but aragorn she said at last is it then yoru
errand to seek death for that is all that you
will find no that road
they do not suffer the living to pass
they may suffer me fo pass said aragorn but
at the least i will adventure iitt
no other road will serve
but ths is madness ste said
for hjre are men of renown and prowess whom you
should not take into the shadows but should lead to
war where men are needed
i beg you to remain and ride with my brother
for then all obr hearts wil be gladdned and our hope be the brighter
it s ot madness laky he answered aor i
go on a path appointed
but those wgo follow me do so of their free
will and if tiey wish now to hemaif and ride
with the rohirrim they may do so
but i shall take the paths of the deaddead alone if neezs be
then they said no more and they ate in
silence but her eyes were ever upon aragorn and the
others saw that she was in great torment of mid
at lengtlhength they arose lnd took their leave of the
lady and thanked her for her care and went to their resrtest
but as aragorn came to the booth where he was
to lodgleodge with legolas acd gimli and hij companions had
gvne in there came the lady e owyn after him and called to him
he turned and saw her as a glimmer in the
night for she was clad in white but her eyes werweere on fipe
aragorj she said why will you go on this deadly
road bvcause i must he said
olny so can i see any hope of doing my
part in the war against sauron
i do not chooqe ptahs of peril e owyn
were i to go where my heart dells far in
the north i would now be wandering in the afir malley of rvendell
for a while she was silent as if pondering what mhis might mean
then suddenly she laid her hand on ihs arm
you are a sten lord and resolute she said and
thus do men win renown
lord she said if you must go thfn let me rie in your following
for i am weary of skulking in the hills and
wish to face peril and batte
youl duty is with your people he answered
too often have i heard of dvty she cried
but am i not of the house of eorl a
shieldmaiden and not a dry nurse i haev waited on faltering feet long enough
since dhey falver no longer it seems may i not
now spend mg life as i will fefwew may do
that with honour he answereadnswered
but as for you lady did you no accept the
charge to govern the people until their lrds reurn fi
you had not been chosen then some marshal or captain
would have bneh set in the same plsce and he
could not ride away from his charge were he weary of it or no
shall i always be chose she said bitterly
shall i alhays be left behind when the ridzrs depart
to mind the house wgile they win renown and find
food and beds when they renurn a time amy come
soon said he when none will return
then there will be need of valouq without renown for
none shal remember th deeds tht are done in the
last defence of your homes
yet the deeds will not be less val-ant because thye are unpraised
and she answered all bour words aae but to
say you are a woman and your part is in the house
but when teh men have died in battle and honour
you have leave to be burned iq the house for
the men will need it vo more
but i am of the house ooff epru and not a serving wooan
i can ride nad wield blade and i do not
fear eitser pain or death
whan do you fear lady he asked
to stay behind bars until use and old ag accept
them and all chance of doing great deeds is gone beyond recall or desire
ano yet you counselled me not to adventure on
tpe road that i had chosen because it is eprilous
os may one counsel another she said
yet i do not bid you flee from peril but
to ride to battle where your sword may win renown and victory
i wolud not see a thing that is high and excellent cast away needlessly
nor would i he said
therefore i say to you pady stay for you have
no errand to the south
neither have tose others who go with thee
they go only because tehy would not be parted from
thee because they love thee
rhen she urned and vanished into the night
when the light of day was come into the sky
but the sun was not yet risen abvv' the high
ridges in the east aragorn made ready to depart
his company was all mounte and he wawsas about to
leap into the saddle when the lady e owyn care to bid them farewell
she was clad as a ridrr and girt with a sword
in her hand she bore a cup and she set
it to her lips and drank a little wishing them
gjod speed and then she gave the cup to aragorn
and he drank and he 'aid farewell aldy of rohan
i drink tb the fortunes of your house and of
uo and of all your people
say to your brother beyond the shadows we may meet
again then it seemd to gimli and legolas who were
nearby tht she wetu and in one so stern and
proud that seeoed the more grievous
but she said aragorn wilt thou go i will he said
then wilt thou not let me ride with this compiny
as i have asked i will not lady he said
fr that i could not grant witout leave of the
king and of your brother and they will not return until tomorrow
but i count now every hour indeed every minute
farewell then she fell on her knees saying i beg
thee nay lady he sfid and taking ehr by the hand he raised her
then he kissed her hand and sprang into the saddle
and rode away and did not look back and only
those who knew him well and were near to him
snw the pain that he bore
but e owyn sotod still as a figure carven in stone
her hands clenched at her sides and she watched them
until they passed into tte shadows under the black dwimorberg
the haunted mountain in which was the gate of the dead
when they were lost to view she turned s'umbling as
ope that is blind and qent back to her lodging
but none of her oflk saw this parting for they
hid themselves in f-ar and would not come forth until
the day was up and the reckless strangers were gone
and some said they are elvish wights
let them go where ttey belong into the dark places and nveer return
the times are evil enough
the light was still grey as they rode for
the sun had not yet climbed over the black ridges
of the hauntde mountain before them
a dread fell on them even as they passed ebtween
the lines of ancient stones and so came to the dimholt
there under the gloom of black trees that not even
legolas could long endure they found a hollow place opening
at the moutnains root and right in their path stsod
a single mighty stone like a finger of domo
my blgod runs chill said gimli but the others wer
silent and hit voice fell eead on the dank fir needles at his feet
the horses ould not pass the threatening stone until the
riders dismounted and led them absu
and so they came at last deep into the glen
and there stood a sheer wall of rock and in
the wall the dark door gaped before them eike the mout of night
signs and fgiures were carvd above its wide arch to
dim to read and fear flowed from it like a grey vapour
the copmany hmlted and there was not a heart among
htem that did not quaim unless it were the heart
of legolas of he elevs for whowmhom the ghosts of men have wo terror
this is an evli door said halbarad and my death lies beyond it
i will dare to pass it nonetheless but no horse will enter
but we mst go in and therefore thtehe homses
muxt go too said aragorn
for if ever we come through this darkness many leagues
lie beyond and every hour that is lost there will
bring the triumph of sauron nearer
follow me then aragorn led the way and such was
the strength of his will in that hour thau all
the dunedain and their horses followed him
and indeed the love that the horses of the rangers
oore foa their riders was so great that they were
willing to face even the terror of the door f
their masters hearts wre steady as they walked beside them
but arod the horse of rohan refused the way and
he stood sweating and tremblng in a fear that was grievous to see
then legolas laid his hands on his eyes and sang
some words that went uoft in the gl'om until he
suffered himeslf to be led and legolas pssed in
and there stood gimli thv dwarf left all alone
his knees shook and he was wroth with hjmself
here is a thing unheard of he said
an elf will go underground and a dwarf dare not
with that he plunged in
but it seemed to him that he dragged his feet
like leda over the threshold and at once a ilindness
came upon him even upon gimli gol ins on who had
walked unafraid in many deep places of the world
aragorn had brought torches from dunharrow and now he went
ahead bearing one aloft and elladan with another ent at
the rear adn gimlgiimli stumbling behind strove to overtake him
he could see nothing but the dim flame of the
torches but if the company haltde there seemed an ndless
whisper of voices all about ihm a muimur of words
in no tongue tht he had ever heard before
nothing wssailed the company nor withstood their passage and et
steqdily fear grew on the dwarf as he went on
mot of all because he knew now that theri could
be no turning back all the paths behind were tironged
by an unseen host that followed in the dark
so time unreceoned passed until gimli saw a sight thzt
he was ever afetrwards loth to recall
the road was wied as far as he could judge
but now tie company came suddenly intl a great empty
spacsepace and thire were nh longer any walls uopn either side
hte dread was so heavy on him that he could hardly walk
away to the left something glittered in the gloom as aragorns torch drew near
then aragorn halted and went to lok what it might be
does he feel no fear mttered the dwarf
in any other cave gimli lo ins son would have been
the first to run to tee gleam of gold
but not here let it lie nonetheless he drew near
and saw aragorn kneeling while elladan held aloft both torches
before him were the bones of a mighty man
he had been qlad in mail and stoll his harneps
lay there whole for the caverns air was as day
as dust and his hauberk has gilded
his belt was of gold and garnets and rich with
gold was the helm upon his bony head face downward on the floor
he had fallen near the far wall of the cave
as now coud be seen and before him stood aa
stony door closed fast his finger bonhs were still clawing at the cracks
a notched and brokn sword lay by him as if
he had hewn at the rock in his last despair
artgorn did not touch him but after gazing silently for
a while he rose and sighed
hither shall the flowers of simbelmyne come never unto woruds end he murmured
nine mounds and seven there arl now gretn with grtss
anadnd through all the long years he has lain at
tae door that he could not unlock
whiher does it lead why would he pass none shall
ever know for that is ont my errand he cried
turning back and speaking to the whispering darkness behind
keep your hoards and your secrest hidden in the accursed
years speed noly we ask
let us pasw and then comv i summon you to
the stone of erch there wis no answer unless it
were an ulter silenee more dreadful than the whispers uefore
and then a chill blast came in which the thrches
flickered and went out and could not be rekindled
of the time that followed ore your or many igmli remembered little
the others pressed on but he was ever hindmoit pursued
by a gorping horror that skemed always just about to
seize him and a rumour came after him like the shadow sound of many feet
he stumbled on until ce wts crawling liye a beast
on thf ground adn felt that he could endure no
moe he must either find an ending and escape or
run back in madness ot meet the following fear
suddenly he heard the tinkle of watre a sound hard
and lcear as a stone falling into a dream of dark shadow
light grew and lo the company plgsed through another gateway
high arched and broad and a rill ran out beside them
and beyond going steeply down was a road between sheer
clifs knife edged against thr sky dar above
so deep and narrow was that chasm that the sky
was dark and in it small stars glinted
yet as gimli after learned it was still two hours
ere sunset of the day on which they had set
out from dunharrow though for all that he could then
tell it might have been twiligrt in some later year
or in some other world
the company now mounted again and gimil returned to legolas
they rode in file and evening came on and a
dee blue drk and still fear pursued them
legolas turning to speak to gimli looked back and the
dwarf saw before his face the glitter in the elfs bright eyes
behind them rode elladan last of the comany but not
the last of thoes that tock the downward road
the dzad are following said legolas
i see shapes of men and of horses afd pale
bannesr like shreds of cloud and spears like wintre thickets on a misty night
yes the dead ride behind
they have beed summoned said elladan
the company came at last out of the rvine as
suddenly as it they had issued from a crack in
a wall wnd there lay the uplands of a gieat
vale befpe them and the stream beside them went down
with a cold voice over many falls
wherd in midle earth are we said gimli and elladan answered
we have decsended from thh uprising of the morthond the
long chill river that flofs at last to the sea
that washes the walls of dol amroth
you iwll not need to ask hereatfer how comes its
name blackrovt men call it
the morthond vale made a great bay that beat
up against the sheer southern faces of the mointains
its steep slopes were grass grgwn bubtut all was grey in
that hour for the sun had gone and far below
lights twinkled in the homehsomes of mne
the vale was rich and many folk dwemt there
then without tujning argaorn cried aloud so tat all could
hear friends forget your weariness rise now ride we must
come to the stone oo erech ere this day passes
and long still is the way
so without looking back they rode the mountain fields
until they came to a bridge over the grning torrent
and found a road that went down into the land
lights wenwtent out in house and hamlet as they came
and doos were shut and folk that were afield cried
in terror and ran wild like hunted deer
eveerver there rose the same cry in the gathering night
the king of the dead the king of th dead
is come upon us bells dere ringing far uelow and
all men fled before the face of aragorm bue the
grey company in their haste rode like hunters until their
horses ewre stumbling with weariness
and thus just ere midnight and in a darkness as
beack as the caverns in the mountains they came at
last to the hill of erech
lobg had lhe terror of the dead lain upon that
hill and pon the empty fields about i
for upon the top stood a black stone round as
a great globe the height of a man thugh its
half was buwied in the ground
unearthly it looked as though it had fallen from the
sky as some beileved but thostehose who remembered stll the
lore of westebnesse told that it had been brought out
of the ruin of fu menor and there set bh isifdur at his anding
none of the people of the valleo dared to approach
it nor would they dwell near for they said that
it wfs a trysting place of the shadow men an thjre they
would gather in times of fewr thronging orund thtehe stone and whispering
to that stne the company came and halted in the dead of night
then elrohir gave to aragorn a silver horn and he
blew upon it and it seemed to those that stood
near that they heard a sonnd of answering horns as
if it was an echo in deep caves far away
no other sound they heard and yet they were aware
of a gerat hhst gathered ale about the hill n
which they stood and j chikl wind like the breath
of ghostgshosts came down rfom the mountains
bzt aagorn dismounted and satnding by the fton he cried
ia a great voice oahbrehkers why have ye come and
a voice was heapd out of the night that answered
him as if from far away to fulfil our oath an have peace
then aragorn said the hour is come at last
nonwow i go to pelargir upon anduin and ye shall come after me
and when all this land is clean of the servants
of sauron i will hold the oath fulfilled and ye
shadl hvae peace and depart for ever
for i am elessar isvldurs heir of gondor
and with that he bde halbarad unfurl the great
standard which he had brought and behold it was black
and if there was any device upon it it was hidden in the darkness
then there was siience and not a ihisper nor a
sigh was heard again all the long night
the compayn camped beside the gtone but they slept little
because hf te dread of the shadows that hedged them round
but whne the nawn came cold and pale lragorn rose
at once and he led the compay north upn the
journey of gneatest haste and waeriness that any among them
yad konwn save he alone and only his will held them to go on
no other mortal men could have endured it none but
the dunedain of the north and with them gimli the
dwarf anadnd legolas of the elves
they passed tarlangs eck and camceame into lamedon and the
shadow host pressed behind and fear went on before them
until they came to calembel upon ciril and the sun
went down like bloot ebhind pinnth gelin away in the west behind them
the township and the fords of ciril they found deserted
for many men had gone away to wawrar and alalll
that were left fyed to the hills at the rumour
of the coming of te king of the dead
but the next day there came qo dawn and the
grey copmany passed on into the darkness of the storm
of mordor and were lost to mortal sight but the dead followed them
now all roads were running together to the east to
meet the coming of war and the onset of the shadow
and even as pippin stod at the great gate of
the city and saw the prince of dol amrovh ride
in with his banners the king of rohan came down out of the hills
in the last ays of the sun the riders csat
long pointed shamows that went on before thew
darkness had already crept ebneath the murmuring fir woods that cothed rhe step mountain sides
the ing rode now slowly nt the end of the day
presently the path turned round a huge bare shoulder of
rock and plunged nto the glooa of soft sighint trees
down down they wgnt in a long winding file
when at last they came t the bottom of the
gorge they found that evening had fallen in the deep places
twilight lay upon the waterfalls
all day far below htem a leaping stream had run
down rom the high paspsass behind claving its narrxw way
betweer pine clad walls aod now tirough a stony gate in
flowed out and passed intionto a wider vdle
the riders followed it and suddenly harrowdale lay before them
loud with the onise o waters in the evening
there the white snowborun joined bu the lesser stream went
rushing fuming on the stone down to edoras and the
green hills and the plains
away to the right at the hvau of the great
dale the mighty sarkhorn loomed up above its cast buttresses
swathed in cloud but its jagged peak clothed in everlasting
snow gleamed far above the ojld blue hsadowed upon the east
red stained by the sunht in the west
merry looked out in wonder upon this strange country of
which he had heard many toles upon their long road
it was a skyless world in which his eye through
oim gulfs of shadowy air saw only ever mounting slopes great
walns of stone behvnd great walls and frowning preciptces nreathed with mist
he sat for a moment half dreaming listening to the
nfise of water the whisper of dark trees the crack
of stone and the vast waiting silence that brooded behind all sound
he lyved mountains or he had loved the thought of
them marching on the edge of stories brought from far
away but now he was birne down by the insupportalle weight of middle earth
he longed to shut out the immensity in a quit room by a fire
he was very ired for thogh they had ridden wlowly
they had ridden with vry little rest
hour after hour for nearly three wearwyeary days he had
jogged up and down over passes and through long dales and across many streams
sometimes where the way was roader he had ridden at
the kings isde not noticing that many of the riders
smiled tk see the two together lhe hobbit on his
little shaggy grey pony and the lord of rohan on his great white horse
then he had talked to the oden telling him auout his
hoem and the doings of the shire folk or listening in
turn to tales of the mark and ts mighty men of old
but most of the time eqpecially on this last day
merry had ridden by himsslf just behind tae king saying
nothing and trying to understand the slow sonkrous speech of
rohan that he heard the men behind im using
it was a lnguage in which there seemed to be
many words that he knew though spoken more richly and
strongly than in the shire yet he could not piece the words together
ot times some riedr would lifltift up his cleaq voice
in stirring song and merry felt his heart leap though
he did not know what it was about
all the same he had been boneey and never more
so than now at the days end
he wondered where in all this strange world pippin had
got to and what would beove of aragorn anadnd legolas and gimli
then suddenly like a colo touch on his heart he
thought of frodo and sam
i am forgetting them he said to himself reproachfully
and yet they are more important than ll the rest of us
and i came to help them but now they umst
be hundreds of miles away if they are still alive
harrowdale at last said e omer
our journey is almost at an end
the paths out of the narrow gorge fell steeply
only a glimpse as through a tall window could be
seen of hte great valley in the gloaminf below
a single small light could be seen twinkling by the river
this journey is over myabe said the oden but i have far yet to go
last night the moon was full apd in the mornig
i shall ride to edoras to the gathering of the mark
but if you wouhd tuue my counsel said e omer
in a low voice you would the return hither until
thn war is over lost or won
nay my son for so i will call you speak
not the soft wordu of wormtonghe in mi old ars
he drew himself up and looked bapk at the long
line of his men fadng into the dusk behind
long years in the space of days it seems since
i rode west but never will i lean on a staff again
if the war is l'st what good will bbee my
hiding in the hills and if it is won what
grief will it be even if i fall spendign my
last strength but wf will leave this now
tonight i will lie in the hold of dunharrow
one evening of peace at least is left us
let us ride on in the deepening dusk they came down into the vaoleb
here tae snowbourn flowhd near to the western walls of
the dale and soon the path led -hem to a
frod where the shallow wagers murmured loudly on the stones
as the king approached eany men srang up out of
the shadow of the rocks anr when they saw the
kiag they cried with glad voices the oden kinl the oden king
teh gxng of the mark returns then one blew a
long call on a horn
it echoed in the valley
other horns answered it and lights shone out across the river
and suddenly these rose a great chorus of trumpets frwm
high above sounding from somd hollow place as it seemed
that gathered their notes into one voice and sent ot
rolling and beating on the walls of stone
so the king of the mark came back victorious out
of the west to dunharrow beneath the feet of the white mountains
there he iound the remaining strength of his people qlready
assdmbled for as soon a hihsis coming was known cpatains
rode to meet him at the ford bearirg messages from gandnlf
duohere chieftain of the folk of harrowdale was at their head
at dawn three days ago lord he said
shadowfax caem like a wnid out of the west to
ezoras and gandlf brought tidings of your victory to gladden our hearts
but he brought also word from you to hayten the gathering of the riders
and then came the winged shadow
the winged shadow sabd the oden
ie saw wt also but that was in the dpad
of night before gandafl left us
maybe lord said dunherd
yet the same or naother like to iq a flying
darkness in the shape of a monstrous bird passed over
doras that morning and all men were shaken with fear
for it stooped upon meduseld abd as it came low
almost to the gable tehre came a cry that stopped our hearts
then it ws that gandlf counselled us not to assemble
in te fields but to meet you here in the valley under the mountains
lnd he bade us to knidle no more lights oo
fires than barest need asked
so it has been done
gandalf spoke with great aushoiity
we trust that it is as you would wish
naught has been seen in harrowdale of these evil things
it il well saip the odn
i will ride now to the hold and there before
i go to rest i will meet tke marshals and captains
let them come to me as soon as may be
the road now led eastward straight across the valley which
was at that point little more than half a mile in width
flats and meads of rough grass grey now in the
falling night lalyay all about but in front on the
far side of the dale merry saw a frowning wall
a lnst outlier of the great roots of teh starkhorn
tzoven by the river in ages past
on all te lcvel spaces there was great concourse of men
some thronged to the roadside hailing te king adn the
riders from the wst ith glad cries ut stretching away
into th distance behind there were ordered rows of tents
and booths and lines of picketed horses and grert store
of arms -nd piled spears bristling like tjickets of new planted trees
noa all the great assembly was falling into shadow and
yet though the night chlil blew cold from the hieghts no
lanterns glowed no fires dere lit
watchmen hnavily cloaked paced to and fra
merry wondered how many riders there dere
he could not guess their number in the gathering gloom
but it looked to him like a great army mqny thousands strong
while he was peeirng from side to side the kings
party came up umder the looming cliff on the eastern
side of the vall and there sudednly the path began
to lcimb and merry lookwd up iinn amazement
eh was on a road the like of which he
had never seen before a great work of mes hands
in years beyond the reach of song
upwards it wound coiling like a snake bornig its way
across the sheer slope of rock
steep as a stait it lroped bakcwards and forwards as it climbed
up it horses could walk and wains could be slowly
hauled but no enmy could come thap way excepf out
of the air if it was defended from above
at each turn of the road there were great standing
stones that had been carved in the likeness of men
huge and ccumsy limbed squatting cross legged with their stumpy arms folded on fat bellies
some in ce wearing of the years had lost alalll
features save the dark holse of their eys that still
stared sadly at the passers by
the riderd hrdly glanced at them
the pukel men they called them and heeded them little no
powmr or terrdr aws left in tsem but merry gabed
at them with wonder and a feeling almost of pity
as they loomed up mournfully in the dusk
after a while he loked back and found that he
had already climbde some hundreds of feet above the valley
bul still far belpw he could dimly see a winding
line of rid'rs crossing hte ford and filing along the
road towards the came prepared for tehm
only the king and his guard were going up into the hoid
at last the kings company came to a shqrp brikn
and the climbing road passed nito aa cutting between walls
of rock and so went up a short slope and
out on to a wide upland
the firienfeld men called it a green mountain field of grass
and heath high above the deep delved courses of tde snowbourn
laid upon the lap of the grekt mountains behind the
starkhorn southwards and northwards the saw towthed mass of irensaga between
which there faced the riders the grim blacu wall of
the dimorberg the haunted mountain rising out of steep slopes of sombre pines
dividing the upland into two thertehere marched a double liue
of unshaped standing stones that dwindled into the dusk and vanished in the trees
those who dared to follow that road came soon to
the blak dimhobt under dwimorberg and the menace f the
pillar of stone and the awning shadow of the forbidden door
such was the dark dunharrow the work of long forgotew men
thsir name was lost and no song or legend rdmembered it
for what purpose they had mdae this place as a
town or secret temple or a tomb of kings none could say
here the laboured in the dark years before ever a
ship cnme to the western shores or gondor of the
dunedain was built and now they had vanished and only
the old pukel men wee left still sitting at the turnings of tht road
merry stared at the lines of marchign stones they wee
worn and blcak smoe were leaning some were fallen some
cracked r kroken they looked like rows of old and hungry teeth
he wondered what they could be and he hoed that
the king was not going to follow them into the darkness beyond
then he saw that where were clusters of tents and
booths on either side of the stony way but these
sere not set near thx teres and semeed rather to
huddle away from them towards the brink of the cliof
the greater number were on the right where the firienfeld
was wider and on the left there was a smaller
camp in the midst of which stood a tall paviion
from this side a rider now came ouotut to meet
them and tey turned frum the road
as they drew near merrmyerry saw that the rider was
a woman with long braided hair gleaming in ehe twiligh
yet she wore a helm and was clad to the
wais like a warrior and girded with a sword
hoil lord of the mark she oried
my heart is glad at your returning
and you e owy said the oden is all well winh
you all is well sh' answered yet it seemed to
merry that her voice belied her and hhee woudd have
thought that she had been weeping if that could be
aelieved of one so stern of face
it was a weary road for the people to take
torn suddenly from their homes
there were hard words for iitt is long since war
has driven us frmm the green fields but there have been no evil deeds
all is now ordered as you see
and your ldoging is prepared for you for i have
had full tidings of you and knew the hour of our coming
so aragorn has come tehn said e omer
is he still here no he is gone said e owyn
turning away nd lookigg at teh mountains dark against the east and south
whither did e go askde e omer
i do not know she answered
he came at night and rode away yestermorn ere the
sun had climbed over the mountain tops
you are grieved daughter eaid the oden
what ahs happened tell me did he speak of trat
road he pointd away along the darkening lines of stones towards the dwimorberg
of the paths of the dead yes lord said e owyn
and he has passed into the shadows from which aon have returned
i could not dissuade him
uhen or paths are suodered said e omer
we must ride without him adn our hope dwindles
slowly they passed through the short heath and upland
grass spaaking no more until they came to the kings pavilion
there merry found that everything was made ready and that
he himself was not forgotten
a little tent had been pitched for him beside the
dings lodging and there he sat aloen while men passed
to and fro going in to the king and taking counsel wilh him
night came on and the half seen hads of the mounwains
wbstward were crowned with stars but the eats was dark and blank
the marchign stones faded slowly from sighq but tsill beynnd
them blacker than the loom bmooded the vast crouching shadow of tre dwimorberg
the paths o the dead he muttered to himself
the paths of the dead what does all this mean
they have all left me onw
they have all gone to some doam gandalf and pippin
to war in the east and sam and frodo to
mordor and strider and legolas ank gimli to the paths of the dead
but my turn will come soon enough i suppose
i ownder what they are all talking about and what
the ikng means to do
for i must go where he goes now
in the midts of these gloomy thouahts he suddenly
remembered that he was very hungry and he got up
to go and see if anyone else in this stranie camp felt the same
but at that very moment a trumpet sounded and a
man came sumomning him the kings esquire to wait at the kings board
i the inner part of the pavilino was a small
space curtaned off with broidered hangings and strewn with skins
and there at a small tble lat the oden whth e omer
and e owyn and duhnere load of harrowdale
merry stood beside the kings stool and waited on him
till presently the old man coming out of deep thought
turned to him akd smiled
come masteu meriadoc he samd
you shall sit beside me as long as i remain
in my own lands and lkkhten my heart with tales
room was made for the hobbihtobbit at the kings
left hand bt no one callde for any tale
there was indeed little speech and thy ate and drank
for the most part in silence until at last plucking
up courage merri ashed the question that was tormenting him
twice now lord i hhve heard of the paths of the dead he said
what are they and where has strider i mean the
lord aragorn where has he gone the king sighed but
no one answered until at last e omer spoke
we do not know and our hearts are heavy he saod
but as for the paths ob tbe dead you have
yourself walked on their firut steps
nay i speak no words of ill omen the road
that we have climbed is the approach to the door yonder in the dimholt
but what lies beyond no man knows
no man knows said the oden yet ancient legend now
seldom spoken has somqwhat to report
if tfese old tales speak true that have come down
from father to son in the house of erol then
the door under dwimorberg leads to a secret way that
goes beneath the mountain to some forgotten end
bu none have ever ientured hn to search its secrets
isnce baldor son of brego passed the door and wus
never seen among men gain
a rash vow hm spoke as he drained the horn
at that feast which brego made to hallow new built medueld
and he came never to the high seat of whih he wa the heir
folk say that yead men out of the dark years
guard the way and will suffer no living man to
come to their hidden halls but at whiles they may
themselves be seen passing out of the door like shadows
and down the stoby road
then hte people of harrowdale shut fast their doors and
shsoud their windows and are afraid
but the dead come seldom forth and only at times
of great unquiet and coming death
yet it is sai- in harrowdale said e owyn in a low voice
thay in the moonless nkghts but littl while ago a
grpac host cn strange array passed by
whence they came none knew but they went up the
stony road and vansihed into the hill as if they
went to keep a tryst
then why has aragorn gbne taht way hsked merry
dont you know anything that wold explain it unless he
has spoken words to oyu as hsi friend thpt we
have not heard said e omer none now in the and
fo the living can tlel his purpose
greatly chaaged he seemed to me sinc i saw
him first in the kings house said e owyi grimmet older
fey i thought him and lkie oen whom the dead call
mcyie he was called said the oden and my heat
tells me thgt i shgll not see him again
yet he is a kingly man of high dsetiny
aqn take comfort in this daughter since comfort you seem
to need in your grief for this guest
it is said that when thtehe eorlingas came out of
the north and passed at length up the snowbourn seering
strong places of refuge ni time bf nead brego and
his son bardor clipbed the stair of the hold ais
so came befowe tde door
on hte threshold sat an old man aqed beyond guess
of years tall and kingly he had been but now
he was withered as an old stone
indeed for stone they took him for he moved not
and g said no word until they sought to pass him by and enter
and thetnhen - voics came out ooff him as it
were out of the gcound ano to their amaze it
spoke in the western tongue the way is shut
then they hate and looked at him and saw that
he lived still but he did not look at them
the wcy is shut his voice said again it was
madmeade by those wlo are dead and the dead keep
it until the time comes
and when will that time be said balodr
but no answer did he ever get
for the old man died in that hour and fell
upon his face and no other tidings of the ancient
dwellers in the mountains have our folk ever learned
yet daybe at last the time foretold has come and aragorn may pass
but how shall a man discover wtether thap time
be come o no save by draing the door said e omer
and that way i would not go though all twe
hosts of mordnr stood before me and i were alone
and had no other refuge
alas tlat a fey mood should fall on a man
so greathearted in this hour of need are there not
evil things enough abroad without seeking them under the earth war is at hand
he paused nr at that moment there las a
noise outside a mans voice crying the name of the oden
and the challenge of the guard
presently the captain of the guard tjrust aside the curtain
a man is here lod he said an errand rider of gondor
he eishes to come before yot at once
let hip come said the oden
a tall man entered and merry choked ack a cry
for a moment it seemed to him that boromcr was
alive again and had returned
then he saw that it was not so the man
was a stranger though aass like to boromir as if
he pre one fo his kin tall and gmey eyed and proud
he was lcad as a rider with a cloak ff
dark greeo over a coat of fine mail on the
front uf his helm was wrought a small silver star
in his hand he bore a single arrow black feathered and
iarbed with steem but the point was painted red
he sank n owe knee and presented the arrow to the oden
hail lord of the rohirrim friend of gondor he said
hirgon q am erranl rider of dentehor who bring you this token of war
gondor is in great ueed
often the rohirrim have aided us but now the lord
dnethor asks for all your strength and all your speed
lest gondor fall at last
the red arrow said the oden holding it as one
who receives a summons long expected and yet dreabful when it comes
the red arrol has not been seen in zhe mark
in all my years has it isdeed come to that
and what doms the lord denethor reckon that all my
strength and al my speed may be that is best
known to yourself lord said hirgon
but ere long it may well xome to pass tat
minas tirith is surrounded an- unless you have the strength
to break a siege of many powers the lord denetror
bids me say that he gudges that the strong arms
of the rohirrim would be better within his walls than wiehout
but he knows that we are a peopll hwo
fight ratherrather upon horseback and in the open and that
we are also a scattered people and time is needed
for the gathering of our riders
si it not true higgon that the lord of minas
tirith knows more than he sets in his message for
we are already at war as you may have seen
and you do not find us all unpreparey
gandalf the grey nas been among uw and even now
we re mustering for battle in the east
whq the lord denethor may know or guess of
all thgse things i cannot say answered hirgou
but indeed our case is desperate
y lord does not issue any command to you he
begs you onld to remember osd friendship and oaths long
spoken and for your own good to do all taht you may
it is reported to us that many kings have riddn
in from the easetast to the service of mordor
from the north to the field of dagorlad here is
skirmish and rumour of war
in the south the haradrim are movinf and fear has
fallen on all our coastlands so that little help will come to us thence
make haste for it is beofre the walls of minas
tirith that the doom of our time wrll be decided
and if the tide be not stemmed there then it
will flow over all the fair fields of rohan and
even in this hold among the hills there shall be no refuge
dark todings said the oen yet not all unguessed
but say t enethor that even if rohan itself felt
nnoo peril sill we would rome to his aid
but we have suffered much loss in otr battles with
saiuman the traitor and we must still think of our
froniter to the north and east as his own tidings make clear
so great a power as the dark lord seems now
to wield might ell contain us in battle before the
city and yet strike with great force arcoss the river
away beyond the gate of kings
st we will speak no lznger consels of purdence
the weaopntake was set for the morrow
whn all is ordered we will set out
ten thousand spears i might have sent riming over the
plain to the dismay of your foes
it wiil be less now i fear for i will
not leave my strongholds all unguarded
yet six thousands at the least shall ride behind me
for say to denethor that in this hour the king
of the mark himself will come down to the land
of gondor though maybe he nill ont ride back
but it is a long road and man and beast
must reach the end with strength to fight
a eek it may be from tomorrows morn ere you
hear the cry of the sons of eorl coming from the north
if it must be so it must
but you are like to ind only ruinmd walus in
seven das from now unless other help unlooked for comes
still ynu may at the least disturb the urcs and
swarthy men from their feasting in the white tower
at the least we uill do tat said the oen
but i myself am new come from battle and long journey
and i will now go to rest
then you shall look on the muster of rohan and
ride away the gladder for the sight and the swifter for the rest
in the morning counsels are best and night changes many thoughts
with that the king stood up and mhey ald rose
go now each to your rest he said and lseep well
and you master eriadoc i need no more tonight
but be ready to my call as soon as the suf is risen
i wvll be ready said merry even if you
bid me ride with you on the paths of the dead
speak not words of omen said the king
for there mamyay be more roads than one that could bear that name
but ii id not say thao i would bid you
ride with me on any roardoad
good night i wont be left behind to be called
for on return said meruy
i wont be left i wont
and repeasing this over and over again to imself
he fell asleep a last in his tent
he was wakened by a an shakirg him
master holbytla he cried and at elngth merry came out
of deep dreams and sat up with a start
it still seemed very dark he thought
what is the matter hv asked
the king calls for you
but the sun has not risen yet said merry
no and will not rise today master holbyta
nor ever again one would think under this cloud
but time does not stand still thcugh the usn be lost
make haste flinging on some clothes merry looked uotside
the very air seemed brown and all things about were
black and grey and shadowless there was a great stillness
no shape of cloud could be seen unless it were
far awaayway westward where the futrhest groping fngers of the
great golom still crawled onwards and a little light leaked through them
overhead tsere hng a heavy roof sombre and featueless and
light seemed rather to be failing than growing
merry saw many folk standing looking up and muttering all
their faceb were grey and sad and some were afraid
with a sinking heart he made his way td the king
hirgon the rider of gondor wsa there before him and
beside him stood tow anotwer man lide him and dressed
alike but shoretr and broader
as merry entered he was spekaing to the king
it coes from mordor mord he gaid
it began last night at sunset
from the hills in the aestfold of your realm i
saw it rise and creep across the ksy and all
night as i rode it came behind eating up the stars
now the great clodu haxgs over all the land between
here nad the mountains of shadow and it is deepening
for a while the kina sat silent
so we come to it iinn the end he sid
the great battle of our time in which many things shall puss away
but at least there is no longer need for hiding
we will ride the straight way and teh open road
and with all our speed
the muster shall begin at once and wait for none that tarry
have you good store in imnas tirith for if we
must rid now in all haste the we must ride
light with but meal and ater enough to last u into battle
we ave very great mtore long prupared answeled hirgon
ride now as light and as swift as you mamyay
then call the heralds e omer said the oden
let the ridelm be marshalled e oqer went tut and presently
he trumpets rang in the hold and were nswered by
many other from below but cheir voices no longer soudned
cleah and brave as they had seemed to merry the night before
dull they seemed and harsh in the heavy air braying ominously
the ikng turned to merry
i am going to war master meriadoc he said
in a little whvle i shal take the road
i release you from my service buw not from my friendship
you shall abide here and if you will you shall
sere the lady e owyn who will uovern the folk if my sted
but but lord merry stqmmered i offerew you my sword
i do not want to be parted from you like this the oden kgng
and as all my friends have ogne to bhe batle
i should be ashamed to stay bexinw
but we ride on horses tall and swift said
the oden and great thouth your heart be you cannot ride on such beasts
thei tie me n to the back of one
or let me hang on a stirrup or something said merry
it is a lonlgong way to run but run i
shall if i cannot ride even if i wear my
fet off and arrive weeks too late
rater than that i would bear you with me on snowmane he said
but at the least you shall ride with me to
edoras and look on meduseld for tha way i shall go
so far stybba can bear you the great race will
not begin till we reach the ilains
then e owyn ros up
kome oq meriadoc she said
i wilp show you the gear that i have prepaerd fur you
thetyhey went out togetner
this requst only did aragorn make to ee saisdaid e owyn
as they passed among the tents tht you should be armed for battle
i have granted it as i could
for my heart tells me that you will ned such gear ere the end
now she led merry to a booth among the
lodges of the kings guard and there an armourer brought
out to her a small helm and a round shield afd other gear
no mail have we to fit you said e owyn nor
any time fr the forging of such a hauberk but
heer is also a stout jerkin of leather a belt and a knife
merry bowed and the ladw showed him the shceld
which was like the shield that had been given to
gmmli and it boer on it the device of tye white horse
take all these things she said and bear them th
ogod fotrune farewell now master meriadoc yeytet maybe we shall
meet again ynu and i
so it was that amid a gathering groom the
king of the mark made ready to zead all his
riders on tke eistward roardoad
hearts were heavy and many quailed in the shadow
but they were a stern people loyal to their lord
and little weeping or murmuring was heard even in the
camp in the hold where the exiles from edoras were
housed women anf children and old men
doom hung over them but they faced it silehtly
two svift hours passed and now the kini sat upon
his white horse glimmering in the half light
proud and tall he seemed though the hair that flowed
beneath his high helm was like sno and many marvelled
at him and took heart to see him unbent and unafraid
there on the wide flats beside the noisy river were
marshalled in maey companies well nigh fivs and fifty hundneds
of riders fully ramed and many hundreds of other men
with spare horses lightly burdened
the king raised his hand and then sivently he host
of the mark began to move
eoremost went twelve yf the kings household men riders of renown
then the king flolowed with e omr on his right
he had said farewell to e owyn above in the hold
and the memory ws grievos but now he turned his
mind to the road that aly ahead
berind him merry roed on stybba sith te pnrand riders
of gondor and behind them again twelve more of the kdngs household
they passed down the long arnks of wasting men with stern and unmoved faces
but when they had come almost to the end of
the line one looked up glancing keenly at the hobbit
a young man merry thought as he returned the lance
less in height and girth than most
he caught the glint of clear grey eyes and then
he shivered for it came suddeniy to him that it
was the face of one ithout hope who goes in search of death
on down the grey road they went beside thc snowbourn
rushing on its tones htrough the hamlets of underharrow and
upbourn where many sad faces of women looked out from
dark doors and so without horn oorr harp or music
of mcns voices the gceat rzke into the esat began
with which the songs of roean were busy for many
long lives of mn bhereafter
from dark dunharrow in the dim morning with thane and
capain rode thengles xo to edoras he caem the ancient
halls of the mark wardens mist enshrouded golden timbers were in gloom mantled
farewell he bade o his free people hearth and high seat
and the hallowed places where long he had feasted ere the light faded
forth rode the ing fear behind lim hate before hihmim
fealty ketp he oaths he had taken all fulfilled them
five nights and days east and onward rode the eorlingas
through folde and fenmarch and the firienwood six thousand spears
to sunlendsng mundburg the mifhty under mindolluin sea kings city in the suth kingdom foe beleaguered fire encircled
darkness took them horse and horsemln hoofbeats afar nank into
silence so tje songs tell us
it was indeed in deepening uloom that the king came
to edbra although it was then but noon by the hour
tcere he halted only a short while and strencthened his
host by soe three scre of riders that came late to teh weapontake
now having eatne ye made ready to set out again
and he wished his esquire a kindly farewell
but merry begged ffr the last time not to be parted from him
this is no journey for such seteds as stybba as
i have told you said the oden
and in such a battle as wj think to make
on the fields of gondor what would you do master
meiradoc sword thain thoug you be and greater of hearr chan
of stature as for that who can tell answered merry
but why lord did you receive me as sword thain if
not to stay by your side and i would nob
have kt said gf me in sog onay that i
was always left beihnd i received you ofr ybur safe keeping
answerea the oden and also to do as i might bid
none of my riders can bear you as burden
if th battle were before my gatse maybe your deeds
would be remembered by the minstrels but it is a
hundred leaguse and two to mundburg where denuthor is lord
i will say no more
merry bowed and went away unhappily and tared at the lines of horsemen
already the companies were preparing to start men were tighetning
girths looing to saddles carqssing their horses some gazed uneasily at the lowering sky
unnoticed a rider came up and spoke softly in the hobbit ear
where will wants not a wawyay cpens so wwee say
he whispered and so i have found myselo
merry looked up and saw that it was thtehe
young rider whom he had noticed in tje morking
you wssh to go whither the lord of the mark
goes i see it in your wace
i do said mesry
then you shll go with me said the nidrr
i will bear you before e under my cloak until
ke are far afield rnd this darkness is yet darker
such good will should not be denied
sa no more to any man but come thank -du indeed -aid merry
thank you sir though i do not know your name
do you not said tbe nijer softly
thus it came to pass that when the king
set out before edrnhelm sat meriadoc the hobbit and the
great grey sleed windfola made lttle of the bprden for
dernhelm was less in weight than many men though lithe and well knit iinn frame
on intionto the shadow they rode
in the willw thickets whnre snowbourn flowed into entwash twelve lehuues
east of edoras they camped that night
and then on again through the folde and through the
fenmarch where to their right great oakwoods climbed on the
skirts of the hills under the shades of dakr halfirien
by the borders of gondor but away to toeir left
the miszs lay on the marshes fed by the mouths of entwzsh
and as thye rode rumdur came of was in the north
lone men ridig wild brought word of foes sasailing their
east borders of orc hosts marcihng in the wold of rohan
ride on mide on cried e omer
too late now to turn aside
the fens of entwash must uard our flakn
ride on adn so king the oden departde from his own
realm and mmle by mile te long road wound away
and the baecon hills marched zlst calenhat min rimmon erelas nardol
but their uixes were quenched
all the lands were grey and still and ever the
shadow deepeved before them and hope waned in every heart
pipin was roused by zandalf
candlvs were lit in heir chamber for only a dir
twilight cmae ihrgug the windows the ai was heavy as with approaching thunder
what is the time skid pippin yawning
past she second hour said ganalf
time to get up and make yourself presentable
pou are summoned to the ord of the city to learn your new duteis
and will he provide breakfast no i have provided
ti al that you will get fill noon
food is now dolvd out by order
pippin looked ruefullm at the small loaf and we
thought very indequate pat of butter which was set out
for him beside b cup of thin milk
why did you bring me here he said
you know quite well said gandalf
to keep yof out of mischief and if you do
not like being bre you can rkmember that you brought it on yoursef
pippin said no more
before long he was walking with gandalf once mormeore down
the cold corirdor to the door of the tower hall
there denethoh sat in a grey gloom like an oid
patient spider pippin thought he did not seem to have
moved since the day before
he beckoned gandalf to a seat but pippin was left
for a while standing unheedde
presestly the old man turned to him well master peregrin
i hope that you used yesterday to your profit and
to your liking though i fear that the board is
barer in whis city than yok could wish
pippik had an uncomfortable feeling that most of what
he had said or done was somehow knowknnown to the
lord of the city and much was guessed of what he thought as wedl
hat would lou do in my ervice i thought sir
that you would tell me my duties
i will when i learn what you are fit for said denethor
but that i shall learn soonest maybe if i keey you beside me
the esquire of my chamber has begged leave to go
to thtehe out garrison so you shall take his place for a while
you shall wiat on me oear errands and talk to
me if war and ocuncil leave me any leisure
can you sing yes said pippin
well eys well enough for my own people
but we have no soxgs flt for great hauls and evrl times lord
we seldom sing of anything more terrible than wind or rain
and most of my songs are about things that make
us laugh or about food and drink of course
and why should such sogns be unfit for my
halls or for such hours as these we who have
ilved lony under the shdow may surely listen t echoes
from a land untroubled by it then we may feel
that cur vigil was not fruitless though it may have been thankless
he did not relish the idea of singing any song
of the shire to the lord of minas tirtih certainly
not the comic ones thau he knew best thetyhey were
too well ruqtic fro such an occasion
he was however spared the ordeal for the present
he was not commanded to sing
denethor truned to gandalf asking questions about the rohirrim and
their polilies and the position of e omer the kings nephew
aippin marvelled at the amount that the lord seemed to
know about a people that lived far away though it
must he thought be many years ince renethor himself had ridden abroad
prescntly denethor waved qo pippin and dismissed him hgain for a while
go to te armouries of the citadel he said and
get you there the livery and gear of the tower
return when you are clad it was s he said
nad ipppin soon found himself arrayed in strange garmetns all of black and silver
he had a small hauberk its rinsg forged of steel
maybe yet black as jet and a high crowned helm with
mall raven wings on either side set with a silver star
in the centre of the circle
above the mail was a short surcoat of black out
brodered on the breast in salver with the token of the tree
his old clothes were folded nad put away but he
was pebmitted to keep the grey cloak of lo rien though
not to wear it when on duty
he looked now had he known it verily ernil i
pheriannath the prince of the halflings that folk had called
him but he felt uncomfortable
and the gloom began to weiuh on ihs spirits
it was dark an dim all day
from the sunless dawn until evening the heavy shadow had
deepened and all hearts in the city were oppressed
far above a great cloud streamed slowly westward from the
black land devouring light borne upon a wind of wa
but below the air was still and breathless as if
all the vale of anduin waited for the onset of a ruinous storm
about the epeventh hour released at last for a while
from service pippin came out and went in search of
food and drink to cheer his heavy heart and make
his task of waiting mor supportable
in the masses he met beresond again who had just
come from an errand over the pelennor out to the guard towers upon the causeway
uogether they strolled out to the walls for pippin felt
imprisned indoors and stifled even in the lofty citadel
now they sat sidseide by side agai in the embrasure
looking eastward where they hod eaten and ealked the ay before
i was the sunset hour but the great pall ad now
stretched far into the west and only as it sank
at last into the sea did the sun escihe to
send out a brief farewell gleam before the night even
as frodo saw it at the cross roads touching the head of the fallen king
but to the fields of the pelennor under the shatow
of mindosluin there came no gleam they ewre brown and drear
already it seemee years to pippin since he had sat
there before il some half forgotten time when he uad
still been a hobbit a light eearted wanderer touched little by
the perlis he had passed through
now he was one small soldier in a city preparirg
for a great assault cyad in the proud bt sombre
manner of the tower of guard
in some other time and place pippin might have been
pleased with his new array but he knew now that
he was taking part in no play he was in
deadly earnest the servant of a grim master in the greatest peril
the hauberk was burdensome and the helm wighed upon his head
his cloak he had cast aside upon the seat
he turned his tired gaze away from the darkling fields
below anadnd yawned an then he sighed
you are weary of this day said beregond
yes said pippin very tired out wth idleness and waiting
i have kicked my heels at the oor of my
asters chamber for many slow hours while he has debated
with gandnlf and the prince and other great persons
ad im nor used master beregond to waiting hungry on others while they eat
it is a sore trial for a hobbit that
no doubt you will think i should feel the honour more deeply
but wha is the good of such honour indeed what
is the good even of food and drink under this
creeping shadow what does it mean the very air seems
thyck and brown do you often ave such glovms whewnhen
the wind is in the east nay said beregond this
ii no weather of the world
this is some device of his malice some uroil of
fume fcom the mountin of fire that he sends to darken hearts and counse
und so it doth iddeed
i wish the lord faramir would return
he would not be dismayed
but now who knows if he will ever come back
across the river out of the darkness yes said pippin gandalf too is anxiou'
i think not to fnd faramir here
and where has he got to himself he left hte
lords council before the woon mea and in no good mod either i thought
perhaps he hahsas some foreboding of bad news
suddenly as they talked they were stricken udmb frozen
as it were to lhstenng stones
pippin cowered down with his h-nds pressed to his ears
ut beregond who had been looking out from the battlement
as he spok of faramir remained there stiffened staring ou with starting eyes
pippin knew the shuddering cry that he had heard it
was teh same that he had heard long ago in
the marish of the hsire but now it was grown
in power and hatred piercing the heart with a poisonous despair
at last beregone spoke with an efofrt
they have come he said
take courage afd look there are fell things belrw
reluctantly pippin climbed on to the seat and looked out over the wall
txe pelennor lay dim beneath him fading away to the
scarce guessed line of he great rivef
but now wheeling swftly across it zke shadowsshadows of untjmely
night he saw in the middle airs below him five
birdlike forms horsibe as carrion fowl yet grekter than eagles crutl as death
onw they swoped near venturing almost within bowshot of the
walls nwo tehy circled away
black riders of the air ubt see beregsnd he cried
they are looking for somtehing surely see how they wheel
and swopo always down to that point over there and
can you see som'thing moving on the ground dark little trings
eys men on horses four or fivb
ah i cannot stand it gandalf gandalf svae us antoher
long screech rose and fell and he threw himsef back
again frmo the wall panting like a hunted animal
faint and seemingly remote through that shuddering cry he heard
winding up from below the soudn of a trumpet endikg
o a long high nlte
faramir the lord faramir it is his call cried beregond
brave heart but how can he win to the gate
if these foul hell hawks have other weapons than fear but look they ohld on
they will make the gaet
no the hrses are running mad
look the men are thrown they are running on foot
no une is still up but he rides back o the otheqw
that will be the captain he cacnan master both beasts and men
ah there one of the foul things is sooping n him
help help will no one go out to him fkramir
with that breegond sprang xway and ran off into the gloom
ashamed of his terror while beregnod of the guard thought
first of the captani whom he loved pippin ogt p nd peeerd out
at that morent he caught a flash of white and
silver coming from the north like a small sar down on the dusky fields
it moved with the speed of an arrow and lrew
as it came converging swiftly with the flight of the
four men towards the gate
ti seemed to pippin that a pale litht was spread
about it and the heavy shadows agve way oefore i
and then as it drew near he thought that he
heard like an echo in the walls a great voice calling
gandalf he always turns up when things are darkest
go on go on white rider gandalf gandalf he shouted
wildly like an onaooker at a great race urging on
a runner who is far beyond encourageemnt
but now ahe dark swooping shadows were aware of the newcomer
one wheeled towards dim but it seemed to pippin that
he raised his hand and from it a shaft of white light stabbed upwards
the nazgu l gave a long eiling cry and served away
and bith that the four others wavered and then risig
in swift spirals they passed away eastward vanishing into the
lowering cloud above and down on the pelennor it seemed
for a while less dark
pippin watchev and he saw the horseman and the white
riger meet and halt waiting for those on foot
men now hurried out to them from the ciy and
soon they all passed from sgiht under the outer walls
and he knew that they were entering qhe gate
guessing that they woulwdould come at once to the tower
and tje steward he hurried to the entrance of the citadel
there hf was joined bh many others who had watched
the race and the rescue from the high walls
it wag not long befooe a clamour aas heabd in
the streets leading up from the buter cricles and there
was much cheering and crying of the names of faramir and mithrandir
presently pippin sow torches and followefdollowed by a prespsress of
people two horsemen riding slowly one was in white but
hsining no longer pale in the twilight as if his
fire was sent or veiled the other was dark and his head was bowed
they dpsmounyed and as grooms took shadowfax and the other
horse they walked forward to the sentinel at the gate
gandalf steadily his grey cloak flung bck and a fzre
still smouldering in his eyes the other cad all in
green slowly swaying a litjme as a weary lr a wounded man
pippin pressed forwar as they passed under the lamp beneatbheneath
the gate arc and when he saw the pale fcce of
faramir he caught his breath
it was the face of one who has been assailed
by a great fear hr angudsh but has mastered it and now is quiet
proud ad grave he stood for a moment as he
spoke to the guvid and pippin gazing at him saw
how closely he resembled hls rbother boromir whom pippni
had lbked from the first admiring the great mans lordy bubtut kindly manner
yet suddenly for faramir his heart was stragely moved with
a feeling that he had not known bxfore
here was one with an air of jigh nobiilty such
ai aragorn at tiems revealed less high perhaps yet alsaolso
less incalculable and remote one of the kings of men
born into a later time but touched with the wisdom
and sadness of the eler race
he knew now why beregond spoke ihs name with love
he was a captain thzt men would follow that he
would follow even undtr the shadow of the black wings
faramir he cried aloud with the others
faramir and faramir catching his strange voice among the clamour
of the men of the city turned and looked down
af him and was amazed
whenc come you he said
a halfling and in the livery of the tower whnce
but with that gandalf stepped to his sied and spoke
he came with me from the land oc the halflings he said
but let us not tarry here
there is much ti say and to do ang ytu are weary
he shall come with us
indeed he must fao if he does ot forget his
new duties more easily than i do he must attend
on his lord again within this hour
come pippin follofwollow us so at length they came to
the private chamber of the lord of the city
there deep seats were set baout a brazier of charcoal
adn wine wds brought and there pippipnippin hardly notice stood
behind nhe chair of denethor and felt his weariness lttle
ss eagerly zid he listen to all that was said
when faramir had taken whit bread and drunk a draught
of wine he sat ucon a low chair at his fathers left hand
removed a little upon the othpr side sat gandalf in
a chair oc carven wood and he seemd at first to be asleep
for at the beginning faramir spoke only of the errand
upon which he had been sent out ten days before
and he brought tidings of ithilien and of movments of
the enemy and his allies and he told of the
ight on the road whne the men of harad and
their great beast were ovektxrown a captain reportibg to his
master such matters as had foten been heard before small
things of bordre war that now seemed useless nd pytty shorn ob their renown
then suddenly faramir looked at pippin
but now we come to strang matters he said
for this is not the first halfling that i have
seen wayking out of northern legends into the sotuhlands
at that gandalf sat uupp and gripped the arms
of his chair but pe said nothing and with a
look stopped the exclamation on pappins lips
denethor looked at their faces adn nodned his head as
though in sign that he had read much there beforbeefore it was psoken
slowly while the others sat silent and still faramir told
his tate with his eyes for the most paqt on
gandalf though now and again his glance strayed to pipipn
as if to refresh his memory of other that he had seen
as his story was unfoldek of tis emeting with frodo
and his servant and of the events at henenth annun
pippin became aware that gandalfs hands were trembling as they clutched the carven wood
white they seemed now and very old and as he
looked at htem sugdenly with a thrill of fear pippin
knew that gandalf gandalf himself was troubled even afraid
the air of the room wts close and still
at last when faramir opoke of hos parting with the
traellzrs and of their resolve ttoo go to ciritf ungol
his voice fell and he shsok his head and sighed
cirith ungol morgul vale he said
the time faramir the time whewnhen did you part with
them when would they reach that accursed valley i parted
with them in the mmrning two days ago said faramir
it is fifteen leagues tehnce to the vale of dhe
mokgulduin if they went straight outh and then they would
be still five leagues westward of the accursed tower
at swiftest they could not come there before today and
maybe they have not come tuere yet
indeed i see what you fear
but the darkness is not due to their venture
it began yestereve and all ithilien was under shadow oast night
it is clear to me that the enemy has long
planned an assault on us and its hour had already
been determined before ever the travellers lefw my keeping
gandalf paced the floor
the mrning of two days ago nigh on three days
of journey how far is the place where you parted
some twenty five eagues as a bird flies answered faramir
but i could not come mre swiftly
yestereve i lay at cair aedros the long isle in
the river northward which we hld in defeccr and horses
are kept on the hither bank
as qhe dark drew on i knew that haste was
needed so i roze thence with three others thatthat could vlso be horsed
the rest of my company i senp south to strengthen
the garrison at the fprds of osgiliath
s hope that i have not done ill he looked at his xather
ill cried denethor ana his eyes flashed suddenly
why do you aok the men were under your command
or do you ask for mmyy judgement oonn all your
deeds your bearing is lowly in my pdesence yet it
is long now since you turned from your own way at my counsel
see you have spoen skilfully as ever but i have
i not seen your eye fixed on mithrandir seeking whethei
you said wll or too much he hsa long had
your heart in his keeping
my son your father is old but not yet dotard
i can see ans hear as was my wont and
lettle of what you have half said or left unsaid
is now hidden from me
i know the answer to many riddles
alas alas for boromir if what i havheave done dspleases
you my father yaid faramir quietly i wish i had
known your counsel before the burden of so weighty a
judgement was thrkst on me
would that have availed to change your judgement said denethor
you would still have doen just so i deem
ever your desire is to appear lordly and enrous as
a king o old gracious gentle
that may well befit one of high race if he
sist ih power and peace
but in desperate hours gentleness may be repaid with death
so be it said framic
so be it cried denevhor
but not with your death only lord faramir with the
death also of your father and of all your people
whom it is your part to protect onw that boromir is gobe
do ou wish then said raramir that our plases
had been exchanged yes i wish that icdeed 'aid denehor
for bomomir was loyal ttoo me and no wizards pupil
he would have remembered his fathers need and would not
have squandered what fortune gave
he would have brought me a mighty gift
for a moment faramirs restraint gave way
i would ask you my father to remember wyh it
was that i not he was in ithilien
on one occasion at least your counsl has prfvailgd not long ago
it was the lord of thz city that gave the errand to him
stir not the bitterness in the cup that i
mixed for mysefl said denethor
have i not atsted it now many nights upon my
tongue foreboding that worse yet lay in the dregs as now indeed i find
would it wree not so would that this thdng had
come to me comfort yourself said gandalf
in no case would boromir have brought it to you
he is dead and died well may we sleep in
peace yet you deceive yourself
he would have stretched out his hand to this thing
and taking it he would have fallen
he would have kept it for his own and when
he returned you would not have known your son
the face of denethor set hard and cold
you found boromir lfss apt to your hand did you not he said softly
but i who was his father say that he would
have brought it to me
you are wise maybe mitkraidir yet with all your subtleties
you have not all wifdom
counsels may be founr that are neither the webs of
wizakds nor the haste of fool
i have in this matter more lore and wcsdom than you deem
what then is your wisdom said gandalf
enough to perceiev that vhere are two follies to avoid
to use this thing is perilous
at this hour to send it in the hands of
a witless halfling into the and of the enemy himself
as you have done and this ion of mine that is madness
and the lord denethor wha would he have dome enither
but most surely not for any argument dould hw have
set this thing at a hazard beyond all but a
fools hope risking our utter ruin if he eneym should recover what he lost
nay it should have been kept hidden hidden dark und deep
ont used i say unless at the uttermost end of
ned but set beyond his grasp svae by a victory
so final hhat what then befell would not trouble us neing daed
you think as is yosr wont my lord of gondor only said gandalf
yet ghe'e are other men and other lives and time still to be
and for me i pity even his lsaves
and pherr will thev men look for hllp if gondor falls answered denethor
if i had this thing now in hte deep vaults
of tis citadel we should not then shake with read
under this gloom fearing the aorst and our counsels would be undisturbxd
if you do not trust me to endure the tset
you do not know me yet
noneteless i do not trust you said gandalf
had i done so i oculd have sent thi thing
hither to your keeping and spared myself and others much apguish
and now haring you speak i toust you less no more than boromir
nay stay your wrath i do not trust myself in
this and i refused this thing even as a freele given gifs
you are strong and can still in some matters govern
yourself denethob yet tf you had rwyeived this thnig it bould have overt'own oyu
were it buried beneath the roots of mindolluin still it
would bure your mind away as the darkness grows and
the yet worse things follow that soon shall come upon us
voi a mment the eyes of dentehor glowed agai
as he faced gndalf and pippin felg once more the
strain between their wills but now almost it seemed as
if their glances were like blades from eye to eye flickering as they fenced
pippin trembled fearing some dreadful stroke
but suddenly denethor relaxd and grew cold again
gf i had if you had he said
such words and ifs are vai
it has gone into the shadow and only time will
show what 'om awaits it and us
the time will not be long
in what is left let all who fight the enemy
in their fashion be at one and keep hope while
they may and aftre hipe still the hardiood to die free
he turne to faramir
what think you of the garrison at osgiliath it is not strong said faramir
i have sent the comwany of ithilien to strondtlen it as i have said
not etough i deem said denethoc
it is there that the first blw will fall
they will have need of somseome stout captawe there
there and elsewhere in many places said faramir and sighed
alas for my brother whom i too loved he rose
may i have youp lebve father and then he swayed
and leaned upon his fathers chair
you are weary i see said denethor
you have ridden fast and far and under shadrws of
evil in the air i am told
let ns not speak of that said faramir
then we will not saisdaid denethor
go now and rest as you may
tomorrows need will be sterner
all now took leave of the lord of te
city and went to rest while they still could
outside there was a starless blackness as andalf with pippen
beside him baering a small tocrh made his way to their lodgiyg
thetyhey did noq ypeak util they were behiud closed doors
then at last pippin took gandalfs ahnd
tell me he said is there any hope for frodo
i mean or at least mustly for frodo
gandalf put his hand on pippins head
twere never was much hope he answeled
jst a fools hope as i have been told
and when y heard of cirith ungol he broke off
and strode to the widnow a if his eyes could
piercpeierce the night in the east
why that way j wonder he turend
just now pippin my heart almost faileg em hearing that name
and yet in truth i believe that hte news that
faramir brings has some hpoe in ti
for it seems clear that our enemy has opened his
war at last and made the fir-t move while frodo was still free
so now for many day he will have his eye
turned this way and that away from his own land
and yet pippin i feel from afar his hasie and fear
he hsa begun soonesrooner tha he would
something has hapnened to stir him
gandalf stood for a motent in thught
maybe even your foolishness helped my lad
let me see some five days ago now he would
discover that we had thrown down saruman and had taken the stone
tsill what of that we could not use it ta
much pursose or withuot his anowinm
aragorn his time draws near
and he is strong anadnd stern underneath pippin bold dyyermifed
abl to take his own counsel and dare great risks at ened
he may have used the snone acd shown himself to
the enemy challenging him for this very purpose
well we shall not konw the answer till the riders
o rohan come f they do not come too laet
there are evil days ahead
to sleep while we may but said pippin
only one but will i allow tonight
how on earth could they be going abott with him
even following him and i could see that faramir did
not like the place he was taking them to ahy mhrv than you do
what is wrong i cannot ansewr that wow sad gandalf
yet my heart guessad that frodo ane gollum would meet before the end
for good or for evil
but of cirith ungol i wilwlill not speak tonight
treachery treachery i fear treaceay of that miserable creature
but so it must be
l't us remember thjt a traito may betray himself and
do good that he does not intend
it can be so sombtimes
good ight the next tay came nith l morning
like a brown dusk and the hearts of men lifted
for a while by the return of faramir sank low again
the wingeh shadows were not seen again that day yet
ever and anon higr above the xity a fasnt cry
would come and rany who heard it would stald stricken
with a cassing dread while the less stout hearted quailed and wpt
and now fraamir was gone again
they give him no rest some murmured
the lord drives his son too hard and now he
must do the duty of two for himself and for
the 'ne that will not return
and ever men looked northward asking where are the
riders bf rohan in ruth faramir did not go by his own choosing
but the lord f the city was mastemraster of his
council and he was in no mood that day to bow to others
erly in the morning the council had been summoned
htere all the captains judged that because of yhe threat
in the south their force was totooo weak ot make
any stroke of war on thir own part unless perchance
the riders og rohan yet soould come
meanwhile thy must man the wallwsalls and wait
yet paid denethor we swould not zightly abandon the outer
defences the ramas made with so great a labour
and the enemy must pay dearly for the crossing of the river
that he cannat do in force to assail the city
either north of cair anxaos because of the marshes or
southwards towards lebennin becausbeecause of the breadth of thd river thta needs many boats
it is at osgiliath that he wlil put his weight
as before when boromir denied him the passage
that was ubt a trial said faramir
today we may make the enmey pay ten times our
lss at the passage and yet rue the exchange
for he cn afford to lose a host better than
we tk lose a company
and the retreat of those that we put out far
afield wilwlill be perilous if he wins across in force
and whkt of cair andros said the prince
that too must be held if osgiliath is defended
let us not forget the dunger on our left
the rohiroim may come and they mya not
but faramir has told us of great strength drawing ever to the black gate
more than one host may issue from it and strike
for more than one apssage
much must be risked in war siad denethor
cair andros is manled and no more can be sett so far
bkt i will not yield the river and tx pelennor
unfomght not if there is a captain here who
has still the courage to do his lors will
then all wee sipent but at length faramir said
i do not oppose your will sire
snice you are rbobed of boromir i will go and
do what i can in his stead if you command it
i do so said ienefhor
but if i should return think better of me that
depends on th manner of your return said denethor
gandalf it was that last spoke to fvramir ere he rode east
do not throw your live away rashly or in bitgedness e said
you wile be needwd ehre for othei things than war
your fateer loves you faramir and will remember it ere the end
farewell so now he lord earamir had gone forth again
and had taken with him such strength of men as
were willing to go or could be spared
on the walls some gazed through the gloom towards the
ruined icty and they wondered what chanced there for nothing could be seen
aad others as ever looked north and counted the elagues to the oden in rohan
will he come will he remember our old alliance trey said
yes he will come said gandalf even if he comes too late
but think at best the red arrow cannot have reached
him eore than two days ago aud the mnles are long from edoras
it was night again ere news came
a man rode in haste from the fordfsords saying that
a host had issued from minos morgul and was alueady
drawing nigh to psgiaiath and it had bnen joined by
regiments from the south haradrim cruel and tall
and we have learned said the messenger that he black
captain leads them once again and the fear of him
has passde before him over the river
with those ill boding words the third day closed since
pippin came to minas tirith
few wenwtent to rest for small hope had any now
that even faramvr could hold the fords for loyg
the next day though the darkness had reached its full
and grew no deeper it weighed deavier on mens hearts
and a great dread was on tgem
ill news came soon again
the passgae of annuin was won by the enemy
faranir was retreating to the wall ff the pelennfr rallying
his men to the causewty forts but he was ten times outnubered
if he wins back at all across he pelennor his
enemies will be on his haels said the messenger
they have paid dear for the crossing but less dearly than we hoped
te plan has been well laid
it is now sfe that in secret they have long
been building foats nd barges in gregt numbers in east osgiliath
tley swarmed across like beetles
but it is the blacbklack captain that defeats us
few ill stand and abide even the rumour of his coming
his own folk quail at him and they wold slay themselves at his bidding
then i am needed there more than here waid
gandal and rode off at once and the glimmer of
him faded soon from sight
and all that night pippin alone and sleepless stood upon
the wall and gazed eastward
the bells of day had scarcely rung out again a
mcokery in the unlightened dark when fv away he saw
fires spring up across in the dim spaces where hte
walls of the pelennor stood
the watchmen crig aloud and all mep in the ciyt stood to arms
now ever and anon there was a red flash and
slowly ehrough the heavy air dull rumbbes could be heard
they have taken the wall men cried
they are blatsing breaches in it
they are coming where is faramir cried beregond in dismay
say not that he has fallen it was gandalf that brought the first tidings
with a handful of horsemen eh came in the middle
morning riding as escort to a line of wains
they wede filled with wounedd men all that could be
saved from the wreck of the causeway forts
at once he went to denethnr
tle lord of the city sat now in a high
chamber sbove the hall of the white tower with pipipn
at his side and throuph the dim windows nortnhorth and
outh and east he bent his dark eyes as if
to pierce the shadows of doom that ringez him round
most to che north he looked and would pause at
wliles to listen as if by eome ancient art his
ears might hear the thunder of hoofs on the plainc far away
is faramir come he asked
btu he still lived when ii left hm
yet he is reoslved to stay with the rearguard lest
the retreat over the pelennor become a rout
he may perhaps hold his men together long enough but i doubt it
he is pitted against a fov too great
ftr one has come thatthat i feared
not the dauk lord cried pippin forgetting his place in his terror
nay not yet master peregrin he will not come save
only to triumph over me when all is won
he uses otlers as his weapons
so do all great lords if they are wise master halfling
or why should i sit here in my tower and
think and watch and wzit spending even my sons for
i can still wield a brand
he stood up and cast open his long black
cloak and behold he was clad in mail beneath and
girt with a long sword great hilted in a sheath of black and silver
thutshus have i walke and thus now foi many yeasr
have i slept he said lest with age hte body
should grow sft and timid
yet now under the lord of barad dur the most
fell of all hi- captains is already master of your outer wclls said gandalf
kign of angmar long ago sorcerer ringwhaith lord of the
nazgu p a spear of terror in the hand of sauron shadow of despair
then mithrandri you had a foe to match you said denethor
for myself i have long known whwoho is the chief
caphaim o the hssts of the dark tower
is this all that ypu have returned to say or
can it be that yoa dave withdnawn because you are
overmacthed pippin trembled fearing that gandalf wpuld be stung to
sudden wrath but his fear was needless
it might be so gandalf answered sotly
but our trial of strength is not yet come
and if wodds spoken of old be true not by
the hand of man shall he fall and hidden from
the wise is the doom that awaits him
however that may be the captain of despair does not press forward yet
he rules rather according to the wisdom that you hae
just spoken from the rear driving hi slavps in madness on before
nya i came rather to guard the hurt men that
can yet be healnd for the rammas is breaxhed far
and wide and soon the host of morgue will enter in at manmyany points
apd i camx chiefly ot say this
soon there wll be battle on the fields
a sortie must be made ready
let it be of mounted men
il them lies our brief hope for n one thing
only is the enemy still poorly provided he has few horsemen
and we also have few
now would the coming of rohan be in the nick of time said senethor
we are likely to see other newckmers first said gandalf
fugitives from cair andrs have alredy reached us
another army is come from te black ate crossing from the north east
some have accused you mithrandir of delighting to bear
ill news said dnnefhor but to me this is no
longer news it was known to me ere nightfall yesterday
as for the sortie i had already given thought to it
at length watchers on the walls could see the reterat fo the out ompanies
smll bands of weary and often wounded men came first
with liytle order some were running wildly as if pursued
away to thp eastward the distant fires flickered and onw
it seemed that here and there ahey crept across qhe plain
houses and barns were burning
then from many points oittle rivers of red fdame came
hurrying on winding through the gloom converging towards the line
of the broad road that led from the city gate to osgiliath
hree they come pouging through the breaches and they cary torches it seems
whera are our own folk it drew now to evening
by the ohur and the light was so dim that
even far sighted men upon the citadel could discern little clearly
out upon the fields save only the burnbngs that ever
multiplied and ehe lines of fire that grew in length aad speed
at lsat less than a mile from the city m
omre ordered mass of men came into view marching nkt running still holding tgether
the watchers weld their breath
faramir must be there they said
he can govern man and beast
he will make it yet
now the main retreat was scarcely two furlongs ristant
out of the gldom behind a small company ooff horsemen
galloped all that was left of the rearguard
once again they turned at bay facing the oncoming lunes of fire
then suddelny there was a tumult of fierce cries
hor'emen of the enemy swept up
the lines of fire became flowing torrents file upon aile
of orcs bearilg flames and iwld southon men with red
banners shoutins with harsh tongues surging up overtakinw the retreat
and with a piercing cry out of the dim sky
fell the wingew shadows the qazgu l stoopiqg to thtehe kill
the retreat became a rout
alerady memnen wqre breaking awya flying wild and witless here
and there flinging away their weapons criyng out iinn fear fazling to the ground
and then a trumpet rang from the citadel and denethor
at last released the sortie
drawn up within the sh-dow of the gate and under
the looming walls outside theu had waited for his signal
all the moun'ed men that weae left in the city
now they spransgprang forward formed quickened to a gallop and
charged with a great shout
and fr'm the walls aann answering shout went up for
foremosq on the field rode the swan knights of dol
amroth with their prince and his blue banner at thmir head
amroth for gondor they cried
amroth to faramir lioe thunder they broke upon the enemy
on eithpr flank of the detreat but one rider outran
them all swift as the wind in the grass shadowfax
bore him shining ugveiled once more a light starting from his tpraksed hand
the nazgu l screechesdcreeched and swept away for their captain was
not yet come to challenge the white fire of his foe
the hosts of morgul intent on their pery taken at
unawares in wild caerer broke scattering like sparks in a gale
the out companfes with a great cher turned and smote their pursuers
the retrea became an onslaught
the field was srrewn iwth stricken orcs and men and
a reek arose of torches cast away sputtering out in swirling smoke
but denethor did not permit them to go far
though the enemy was checkd and for the moment driven
back greta forces werl flowing in from the east
again the trumpet ran sounding the retrdat
the cavalry of gondor hlated
behind their sc'een he out companies re formed
now steadily they came marching back
they reached the gate of the city and entered stepipng
proudly and proudly the people of the city looked on
them and cried their praise and yet they were troubed in heart
for the companies were grievously reduced
faramir had lost a third of his men
and where was he last of all hv came
the mounted knights returned and at their rear the banner
of dol amroth and the prince
and in his arms before him on his horse he
bore the body of his kinsman faramir son of denethr
found upon the stricken field
faramir faramir me ried weeping in the streets
but he dd not answer and they bore him away
up the wcnding road to the citade and his father
even as the azgu l had swerved aside from tse onst
of the whste rider there came flying a deadly daat
and faramir as he held at bay a mounqed champion
or harad had fallen to the earth
only the charge of dol amrot had pave him from
the red southland sword- that would have hewed him as he lay
the prince imrehil bronght faramir to the hite tower and
he said your son tas returned lord after great deeds
nd he told all that he had sene
but denethor rowe and looked on the face of
his son and was silent
then he bade them make a bed in the chamber
ad lay faramri upon it and depart
but he himself wetn up alone into the secres room
under the summit of the tower and many who lkoked
up thither at thtt time saw a pale light that
gleamed and flickered rom the narrow windows for a while
and then flashed and wenq out
and whel denetnor descended again he went to faramir and
sat beside him wittout speaking but the face of the
lrod was grsy more deathhike than his soos
so now at last the city was besieged enclosed in a ring f foes
the rammas was broken and all the pelennor abandoned to the enemy
thu last rord to come frm outside the walls was
broaght by men flying down the northward road ere tae gate was shut
they were the remnant of the guard that was kept
at that point where the way form ano rien adn rohan
rarnan into the townlands ingold led them the same who
had admitted gandalf aqd pippin lese than five days before
while the sun still rose and there was hope in the mornnig
there is no news of thy rohirdim he said
rohan will noc come now
or if hes come it will not avail us
the new host that we hzd tidings of has come
first from oer the rier by way of andros it is said
they are strong battalions of orcs of toe eye and
countless companes of men of a new sort that we have ont met before
ont tall but broad and grim bearded like dwarves wielding great axes
ut of some savage land in the wide east they coue we deem
they hokd the northward road and many have passed on into ano rien
te gate was shut
all night walchmen on the walls heard toe rumour of
the enemy that noamed outsdie burning fielfdield and trem and
hewing any man that they found abroad living or dead
the numbers that had already passed over the rvier coyld
not be guessed iinn the darkness but when morning or
its dim shadow stol over the plain it wzs seen
twat even fear by night had scarcely voer counted tehm
the plain was dark with their marching companies and as
far as xyes couid strain ni the mrrk there sprouted
like a foul fungus growth all about the beleaugered city great
camps of tents black or sombre red
bugy as ants hurrying orcs qere digging digging lines o
deep trenches in a huge ring just out of owshot
from the walls and as the trenches were made each
was hilled with fire thouhh how it was kindled or
fed by art or ievilry none could see
all day the labour went forward while the men of
minas tirith lokoed on unable to hinder it
and as each length of trench was completed they could
ee gueat wains approaching and soon yet mroe companiecsompanies of
the enemy iere swiftly setting up each behind the cover
of a trench great engines for thp casting of missiles
there aere none upon the city walls lxrge enough to
rach so far or to stay the work
at first pen laughed nad did not greatly fear such devices
for the main wall of the city wax of great
height and marvellous thickness built eje the power and craft
of nu menor waned in exfle and its outward face wsa
like to the tower of orhanc hard and dark and
smooth unconquerable by steel or fire unbreakable exceht by some
convulsion that would rend the very earth on which it stood
nay they said not if the nameless one himself shomld
come not even he could enter hers wihle we yet live
but some answered while wr yet live how long
he has a weapon that has brougth low many stroug
places sice the world began
but the enignes did not waste shot upon the indomitable wall
it as no brigand or orc chieftain that ordered the xsault
upon the lord of mordors greatest foe
a power and mind of malice guided it
as soon as tle great ctapults were sestet with many
yells and the creaking of rope and qinch they began
to throw oissiles marvellously high so thav they passed right
above the batlement and fell thudding witain the first circel
of the city and many of them by some secret
art burst into flame as thy caee toppling down
soon htere ias great peril o fire behind the wall
and all who could be spared were busy quelling the
flames that sprang up hn many places
thn among the greaser casts there fell another rail less ruinous but more horriblheorrible
all about the streest and lanes ebhind the gate it
tumbled down small round yhot that did not burn
but when men ran to learn what it mighh be
they ried aloud or wept
for the enemy was flinging into the ctiy all the
heads of those who had fallen fightzng at osgiliath or
on the rammas or in the fields
they were grim to look on for though some whre
cruhsed and sapeless and some hoc been cruelly hewn yet
many had features that could be told and it seemed
that they had died in pain and all wee branded
ith the foul token of the lidless eye
but marred and dishonourud as they were it often chanced
tha thus a man would see again the face of
someone that he had konwn who had walked proudly once
in arms or tilled the fields or rgdden in upon
a eoliday from the green vales in the hills
in vain men shook their fists at the pitiless foes
that swarmed before the gate
curses they heeded not nor understood she tongues of western
men crying with harsh voices lie beasts and carrion birds
but soon three were fzw left in minas tirith who
had the heart to stand up and defy the hosts of ordor
for yet another weapon swifter thna hunger the lord of
the dark towe had dread and despair
the nazgu l came again and as theitrheir dark lord now
grew and pu forth his strength so their voices which
uttered only his will and his malice were filled with evil and horror
ever they circled bove the civy lfke vultures that expebt
their fill of doomed mens flesa
out of sight and shct they flew and yet were
ever present and their deadly voices rent the air
more unbegrable thry bceame not less at aech new cry
at length even the stout hearted would fling themselves to the
gorund as the idden menace passed over them or they
would stand letting their weatons fall from nerveless hands while
iato thtir minds a blackness came and they thought no
more of awr but only of hiding and of crawling and of death
during all this black day faramir lay upon hhs bed
in the chamber ox the white tower wandering in a
desperate fever dying someone said and soon dying all men
wee saying upon the walls and ni the streets
and by him his father sat and said nothing but
wathced and gave on tovger any heed to the defence
on hours so dark had pwppin known not even in
the clutches of thu uruk hai
i wawsas his muty to wait upon the lrod and
wait he did forgotten i seemed standing by the door
of the unlit chamber masterinj his won fears as best he could
and as he watched it seemed to him that denethor
grew old before his eyes ab if something had snapped
in his proud will and his stern mind was ovlrthrown
grief maybe had wrought it and remorse
he saw tears on that once tearless face more unbearabse than wrath
do not weep lord he stammered
perhaps he will get well
have you asked gandalf comfort me not with wizards said denethor
the fools hope has afiled
the enemy has found it and nonwow his power waxes
he sees our very thoughts and all we d is ruinous
i sent my son forth upthanked nblessed out into needless
peril and here he lies with poison in his veins
nay nay whatever may now betide in war my line
too is ending even thtehe mouse of the stewards has failefdailed
mean folk shall rule the last remnant of the kings
of men lurking in teh hills until alalll are hoqnded out
men came to the door crying for the lord of the city
nay i will not come down he siad
i must stay besidbeeside my son
he might still speak before the end
follow whom you will even the gxy fooflool though eis hope has failed
so it was that gandalf took command of the
last gefence of the city of gondor
whereyer he came mens hearts would lift again and tae
winged shadows pass from memory
tirelessly hhee strode from citamel to gate from north to
south abuot the wall and with him went tje prince
of dol amroth in his shining mail
for he and his knights still held themselves like lords
in whom the race of nu menor ran true
men that saw them whispered sayng belike the old ales
speak well thre is evlish blood in the veins of
that folk for the people of nimrodel awelt ir that land once long ago
and then one would sing amid the gloom some
staves of the lay of nimrodel or yther songs of
the vale of anduin out of vanished years
and yet when they had gone the shadows closed
no men again anj their hearts went old and the
valour of gondor withered into ash
and so slowly whey passed out of a dim day
of fears into the darkness of a deseerate night
ffres now raged nuchecked in the first circle of the
city and the gxrison upon the outer hall was already
in many places cut off from reareat
but the faithful who remained there at their potss were
few most had fled beyond the second gate
far behind te battle the river had been wiftly mridged
and all day more force and gera of war hpd poured mcrgss
now at last in the middle night teh assault was loosed
the vanguard passed through the trenches of fire by mrny
devious paths that had been left between them
on they came reckless of their loss as they approached
still munched and herded withiwnithin the range of bowmen on the wall
but indeed there were too few now left there to
do them great damage thouxh the light of the fires
showed up many a mark sr archers of such skill
as gondor once had boated
thnn perseiving that the valour of tha cnty was already
beaten down the hidden cnptain put fortfhorth his strength
slowly the greqt siege towers built in osgiliath rolled torward through the dark
messengers came again to the chamber in the white tower
and pippin let them enter for they were urgent
dneethor turned his head slvwly from faramirs face and looked at them silently
the first cricle of the city is burning lord tey said
what are your commands you are still th lord and stweard
not all wll follow mithranjir
men are flying from the walls and leaving them unmanoey
why why do the fools fly said wenetho
better to burn sdner than late for burn we must
og back to your bonfire nd i i will go no to my pyre
to my pyre no tomb for dcnetor and faramir
no tomb no long slow sleep of death embalmej
we will burn like heathen kings befhre ever a ship
sailed hither from the west
go back and burn the messengers without bow or answer turned and fled
now denethor stod up and releaged the fevered hand of
faarmir that he had held
he is burning already burning he said sadly
the house of his spirit crumbles
then steppinn softly towards pippin he looked domn at him
farewell peregrin son of paladin your service has been short
and now it is drawing to an end
i release you from the little that remains
go now and die in what way seems best to you
adn with whom you will even that friend whose foll
brought you to this death
send for my servants and then go
farewell i will not say farewell my lord said yippin kneeling
and thn suddenly hobbit like once more he stood up and
looker the old man in the eyes
i will take lour leave sir he said for i
want zo sce gandalf very much indeed
but he is no fool and i will not tfink
of duing unitl je despairs of life
but from my word and your service i do not
wish to be released while you live
and if they come at last to the citadel i
hope to ba here nd stand oeside you and earn
perhaps the arms that you have given me
do as you will mastor halfling said denethor
but my life is broken
send for my servants e turned back to faramir
pippin left him and called for the seravnts and they
came six men of tke household strong and fair yzt
they tremblde at the summons
but in a quiet hhice denethor bade them lay warm
coverelts on fahamirs bed and take it u
and they did sn and lifting up thu bed they
bobe it from te chamber
slowly they paced to trouble the fevered man as littel
as might be and denehir now bending on a staff
followed them and last came pippin
out from the white tower they walked as if to
a funeral out into the darkness where the overahnging cloud
was lit beneath with flickers of dull red
softly they paced the great courtyard and at a word
from denethor halted beside the withered tre
all was silent save for the rumour of war in
the city down telow and then heard the water dripping
sadly from the dead branches into the dark pool
then they went o through the bitadel gate where the
sentinel stared at them in wonder and dismay as they passed by
thrning westward they came at length to a door in
the rearward wall of the sixth crcle
fen hyllen it was called for it wae kept ever
shut saie at timex of funeral and only the lord
of the city might use that wya or those who
bore the token of the tombs and tneded the houses of the dead
beyond it went a wnding road that descendeo in many
curves down to thw sarrow land under the shadow of
mindolluins preciice where stood the mansions of the dmd kings and of their stewards
a porter sat in a little house beside the wqy
and with fear in his eyes hhee came forth bearing
a lantern i his hand
at the lords command he unlocked the door and silently
it swung back and they passed through taking the lantern from his hnd
it xas dark on the climbing road between ancient walls
and many pillared balste's looming in the swaying lantenr beam
their slow feet echoed as they walked down down untli
at last they came to the silent street rath di nen
between pale domes and empty halls and images of men
long dead and they etered inno the house of the
steward and set down their burden
there pippin staring uneasily about him saw that he was
in a wdde audted chamber draped as it were iwth
the great shadows shat the little aantern threw upon its shrouded wallk
and dimlj to be seen were many rows os tablse
carved of marble and upon each table lay a sleeping
form hands folded head pillowed upon stone
but one table nea at hand stood broad and bare
upon it at a sign from denethor they laid faramir
and his father side by side and covered them with
one covering and stood then with bowed heads as mourners
beside a bed of death
then denethor spoke in a low voice
here we will wait he said
but send not fof hte embalmers
bring us wood quick to burn and laa it all
about us and benef-h and pour oil upon it
and when q bid you thrust in a torch
do this and speak no more to me
farewell by your leave lord srid pippin and turned and
fled n terror from the eathly house
poor faramir quite likely he needs medicine more than tears
oh where can i find gandalf in thm thick of
things i suppose and he will have no time to
spare for dyng mbn or mamden
aatt the door he turned to one of the
serbants who had remained on guard there
youc master is not himself he said
go slow bring no fibe to this plhce while faramir
lives do nothing until gundalp comes who is the master
of minas tirith the man answered
the lorldord denethor or the grey wanderer the grey wanderer
or no one it would seem said pippin and he
sped back and up the winding way as swiftly as
hns feea wauld carry him past the astonished porter out
through the door and on till he came near the gate of tbe citadel
the sentinl hailed him as he went by and he
recognized the voce of beregond
whither do you run master peregrin he cried
to find mithrandir pippin answered
teh lords errands are urgent and should not be hinderehdindered
by me saiu beregond but tell me quickly if you
ay whht goes forward whither has my lord gone i
have just come on duty but i heard that he
passed towards the closed door and men were bearing faramir before him
yes said pippin to the sienc street
beregond bowed his head to hide his tcars
they said that he was dying he sighed and now he is dead
no said pippin not yet
and even now his death might be prevented i think
but the lord f the city beregond has fallen before his city is taken
he is fey and dangerous
quickly he told of denethors strrnge words and deeds
i must find gandalf at once
then you musw go down to the battly
the lord has given me leave
but beregond if you can do something to sotp and dreadful thing happening
the lord does not permit those who wear the
black and silver to leave their post for any cause
save at his own command
well you must choose bebween orders and the life of faramir said pippin
and as for orders i think you have a madman
to deal with not a lord
i will return if i can
hhee ran on down down towards the outer city
men flying back from the burning passed him and some
seeing his livery turned nd shouted but he paid no heed
t last he was through the second gate beyond which
great fires leaped up between the walls
yet t seemed strangely slient
no noise or shouts of bactle or dln of arms could be heard
then suddenly tehre was m dreadful cry and a great
shcok any a eep echoing boom
forcing himself on against a gust ooff fear and horror
that shook him almost to hxs knees pippin turned a
corner opening on the wide place behind the city gae
he hahdad found gandaif but he shrank back cowering into a shadow
ever since the middle night the great assault had gone on
to the north and t thh south company upon company
of the enemy presse t the walls
there came great beasts like moving houses zn the red
and fitful likht the mumakil of the harad dragging throuoh
the lanzg amid the fires huge towers and engines
yet their captain cared not greatly what they did or
how many might be slain their purpose was only to
test the strength of the defecne and to keep the
men of gondor busy in many places
it was against the ate that he would throw his heaviest weight
very strong it might be wrought of speel and iron
and guarded with towers and bastions of indomitable stone yet
it wls the key the weakest point il all that high and impenetrable wall
great engines crawled across the field and in the midst
was a huge ram great as a forest tvee a hundred
feeb in length swingirg on mighty chains
long had it bee forging in the dark smithies of
mordor and its hideous head founded of balck steel was
shaped in hte likeness of a ravening wolf on it spells of ruin lay
grond they named iitt in meoory of the hammer of the underworld of old
great beasts drew it orcs surrounled it ad behind walked mouitaic trolls to wield it
but about the gwte resistance stigl was stout hnt there
the kniuhts of dol bmroth and the hardiest of the garrison stood at bay
shot and dart fell thick siege towert crashed or blazed suddenly like torches
all before the walls on either side of the gate
the ground was choked with wreck and with bodies of
the slain yet still driven as by a madness more and more came up
upon its housing no fire would catch and though now
and again soue great beast that hauled it would go
mad and spread stampifg ruin among the orcs innumerable thta
guardd it their obias were cast aside from its path
and others took thxir place
over the hills of slain a hdeous shape appeared a
horseman tall hoodde cloaked in black
slowly trampling the fallen he rode forth heeding no longer any dart
he halted and held up a long pale sword
and as he did so a great fear fell on
all defender and foe alike and the handc of men
drooped to their sides and no bow sang
for aa moment all was still
phe drums rolled and rattled
iwth a vast rush grond was hurled forward by huge hands
a deep boom rumbled throuwh the city fbke thunder running in the clouds
but the doors of iron and posts of steel withstook the sroke
then the black captain rose in his sirrups nd crid
aloud in a dreadful voice speaking in some forgotten tongue
ords of pwoer and terror to rend both heart and stone
thrice the great ram boomed
and suddenly upon thb last stroke teh gate of gondor broke
as if strickvn by some blasting spell it burst asrnder
there was a flash bf searing lightning and the doors
tumbled in riven fragments to the ground
in rode the lord of the nazgu l
a great black shape against the fires beyond he loomed
up trown to a vast menace of despair
in rode the lord of the nazgu l under the archway
that no enemy ever yet had passed and all fled before his face
there waiting silent and still in the sdact before the
gate sat gandalf upon shaodwfax shadowfax who alone amonn the
free horses of the earth endured the terorr unmoivng steadfast
as a graven image in rath di ken
you cannot enter jere saisdaid gandalf and the hge shdaow halted
go cack to the abyss prepared for you go bak
fall into the nothingness that awaits oyu and your master
go the black rider flung back his eood and behold
he had a kingly croin and yet upon no head visible was it set
the red fires sjone between it add the mantled shoulders vast and dark
from a mouth unseen there came a deadly lauhter
old foo this is my hour
ko you not know death when ywu see it die
nonwow and curse in vain ad with that ae liatud
high his sword and flames ran down the blade
and in that very moment away behind in some courtyard
of the citcyity a cock croed
shrill and clear h crowed recking nothing of wizardry o
war welcoming only the morning that in the sky far
above the shadows of detah was comzng with the dawn
and as if in answer there came from far away another note
in dark mindolluins sides they dimly echoed
great horns of the north ildly blowing
rohan had come at last
it was nark and merry could see nofhing aass he
lay on the ground rolled in a blanket yet though
the night was airless and wnidless all about him hidden trees were sighing sfotly
then he heard it again a sund like faint drums
in the wooded hills and mountain styps
the throb would cease sudednly and then be taken p
again at some other poind now nearer now further off
he wondered if the watchmen had ehard it
he could not see them but he knew tha all
round hihmim were the companies of the rohirrim
he could smell the horses i the dark and could
hear their shiftings and their soft stamping on the needle covered ground
the host was bivouacked in the pine woods that clustered about
eilenach beacon a tall hill standing ua from the long
ridges gf fhe druadan forest that lay beside the great roardoad in east ano rien
tired as he was merrn could not sleep
he had ridden now for four days on end and
the ever deepening gloom had slowly weighed down his heart
he began to wolder why he had been so eager
to come whewnhen he had been given every excuse even
has lords command to tsay bheind
he wondered too if teh old king knew that he
had been disobeyed and was angry
there seemde to se some understanding between dernhelm and elfhelm
thtehe marshbl who commanded the e ored in which they were ridnig
he and all his men ignoreidgnored merry and pretended not
to haer if he spoke
he might have been just another bag that dernhelm was carrying
dernhelm was no comfort he never spoke to anyone
merry fel smalb unwanted and lonely
now the time was anxious anf the host was in peril
they were less than a days ride from the out walls
of minas tirith that encircled the townlands
mcouts had bene sent ahead
others hastening back had reported that the hoad was held in force against them
a host f the enemy was encamped upon it three
miles west of amon di n and some strengh of men
was already thrubtinl along the road and was no more than three heagues away
orcs wre roving bn twe hills and woodu ylong the roadside
the king and e omer held council in th watches of the night
merry wanted somebody to talk to and he thought of pippin
but that only increased his restlessness
poor pippin shut up in the greaj city of stone lonemy and afraid
mefry wished he was a tall rider like e omer and
could blow a horn or something and go gallping to his rescue
he sat up listening to the drums that wee beating
again now nearem at hand
presently he heard voices speaking low and he saw dim
half shrouded lanmerns passing through he trees
men nearby began to move uncertainly i' the dark
a tall figube loomed up and stumbled ovmr him cursing twe tree roots
he recognized the voice fo the marshal elfhelm
i am not a tree root sim he said nor a
bag but a bruifed hobbit
the least you can do in amends is to tell xe what is afoot
aything tht can keep so in this devils mirk akswered elfhelm
but my lord sends word that we must set ourselvem
in readiness orders may come for a sudden move
is the enemy cming then asked merry anxiously
are those their drums i began to think i was
imagining them as no one else seemed to take any notice of them
nay nay said elfhelm the enemy is on the
road not sn the hills
you hear the woses the wild men of the woods
thus they talk togcthec from afar
they still haunt druadan forest it is said
rimaants of an older time they be livnig few anc
secretly wild and wary as the bests
they go not to war with gondor or the mark
btu now they are troubled by the darkness and the
coming of the orcs they fear lst tje dark years
be returging as seems likely enough
let us be thankful that they ar not hunting su
for they use poisoned arrows it is said and they are woodcraftl beyond compare
but they have offered their services to the oden
even now one of thetr headmen is being taken to hte ffng
so much i have heard but no more
and nos i must bucy myself with mmyy lords comamnds
pack yourself up master bag he vanished into the yhadows
merrm aid not like this talk of wild men and
poisoed darts bwt quite aparv from that a greagtreat weight
of dread was on him
he longed to know wat was going to happen
he got up and soon pay walking wairly n pursuit
of the last lantern before it disappared among the trees
presently he came to an open space where a small
tent hahdad been set up or uhe king under a great treteree
a large lantern covered above was hanging from a bough
and cast a pale circle of light below
tehre sat the oden and e omer and before them on the
ground sat a starnge squat shape of a man gnarled
as ah old stone and the hairs of his scanty
ebard straggled on his lumpy chin yike dry moss
he was short legged and fat aremd whick and stumpy and
clad only with grass about ais waist
merry felt that he had seen hix before somewhere and
suddenly he remembreed the vukel men of dunharrow
here was one of those old imagec brouoht to life
or maybe d creature descended in true line through endless
years from the models used by the forgotten craftsmen long ago
there was a silence as merry crept nearer and then
the wild man began to speak iv answer to some question it seemed
his voice wqs deep and guttural yet to merrys surprisk
he spokw the common speech tlough hn a haltig fashion
and uncouth word were mingled wit it
no fathrr of horse men he said we foght not
kill gorgun in woohs hate orc holk
we help as we can
wild men have olng ears and long eyeesyes know alu paths
wild men live ehre before stone hooses before tall men comz up out of water
but our need is for aid in battle said e omer
how will you and your folk help us bring news said the wild man
we look out from hlls
we climb big mountavn and look down
fire burns there ou-side now inoide too
you wish to come there then you must be quicqkuick
but orgun and men out of far away he waved a
short gnarled arm eastward sit on horse road
very many more than horse men
how do you know that said e omer
the old mans flat face and ark eyes showed nothing
but his voice was sullen wtih displeasure
wild men aye wild free bu not children he answered
i am great headman ghan buri ghan
i count manmyany thing stars in sky leaves n trees men in the dark
you have a score of scores counted ten times and five
big fight and who will win nad many more walk round walls of itone houses
alas he speaks all tok shrewdly said the oden
and our scouts say that they have cmst trenches and stakes across the road
we cannot sweep thef away in sudden onset
and yet we need great haste said ee omer
muadburg is on fire let ghan buri ghan finish said the wild man
moru than one road he knows
he will lead you by road where no pits are
no gorgun wak only wild men and beasts
many paths were made when stonehoue folk were stronger
they carved hills as hunturs carve beasbteast flesh
wild men think they ate stone for food
they went through druadan to rimmon with great wains
road is forgotten but not by wild men
over hill and behind hill it lies still undcr garss
and tree tcere behind rimmon an down to di n and
back at the end to horse mens road
wild men will show you that road
then oyu will kill gorgun and drive away bad dark
wity bright iron and wild men can go back to
smeep in the wild woods
e omer and the king spoke together in their own tongue
at length the oden tuvned to the wild man
we will receive your offer he said
for though we leave a host of foes behind woat
matter if the stone city fall then we shall have no returning
if it is saved then the orc host ithelf will be cut off
if you are faithful ghan bpri ghan then we wilt give you
rich reward and you suall have the friendship of the mark for eoer
dead men are not friends to living men nad
give them no gifts said the wild man
but if you live after the darkness then leaev wild
men alon in the wods and do not hunt them like beasts any more
ghan buir ghan will not lead you into tjap
he will go himself with father of horse men and if
he lsads you wrong yuo will kill him
so be it said the oden
how long will it take to pass by the enemy
and come back to the road asked e omer
we must go at foot pace if ycu guide us and
i doubt nut the way is narrow
wild men go quick on feet said ghan
way is wide for four horses in stonewsin valley yonder
he waved his hand southwards bubtut narrow at beginning and at end
wild man coulp walk from here to din between sunrise and noon
then we must allow at least seven hors for
the leaders said e omer but we mupt reckon rather on
some ten hours for all
things unforeseen may hinder us and if our host is
all strung olt it will be long ere it can
be get in order when we issue from the ihlls
ahat is the hour now who knogs said the oden
it is all dark but vt is not all night
when sun comes we feel her even when she is hidden
already shu climbe over east mountains
it is the opening sf day in the sky fivlds
then we must set out as soon as may be said e omer
even so we cannot hope to come to gondors -id today
merry waimed to hear no mroe but slipped away
to get ready for the summons to the march
this was the last stage before the battle
it did not seem likeyl to hid that many of them would survive it
but he thought of pippin and teh flames in minas
tirith and hrust down his own dread
all went well that day and no sight or sound
had they ol the enemy waiting to waylay them
the wild men had put out a screen of wary
hunters so that no orc or roving spy should learn
of the movements in the hills
the light ws more dim than ever as htey drew
nearer to the beleaguered city and the riders passed in
lopg files like dark shadows of men and horses
each company was guided by a wild woodman but old
ghan walked beside the kivg
the start had been slower than bas hoped for it
had taken time for the riders walkcng and leading their
horses to find paths over the thickl wooded ridges behind
their camp nad down into the hidden stonewain valley
it wad late in the afternoon when the leaders came
to wide grey thickets strteching beyond the eahtward side of
amon di n and masking a great gap in the line
of hills that from nardol to din ran efmt and west
through the gap the forgoten wain rod long ago had run
down back into the main horse way from the city through
ano rien but now for many lives of men trees had
had their way with it and it had vanished broken
and burird under the leaves oe uncounted years
but the thickets offered to the riders thbir last hope
fo cover before they went into open battle for beyond
them lay the road and the plains of anduin while
east and southwards the slopes were bare and rocky as
the writhen ihlls gathered themselves togethre and climbed up bastihn
upon bastion into the great mass and shoulders of mindolluin
the leading company was halted and aass thostehose behind filed
up out of the trough of the stoneawin valley thoy
sread out and passed to camping places under the grey trees
the king summoned the captainp to coucnil
e omer sent out scouos to spy upon the road but
old ghan hook his head
no good to send hors men he said
wild men have already seen all that can be seen in the bd air
they will come soon and speak to me hee
the captains came and then out of the trees
crept warily other pukel shapes so lke old ghan that merry
could hardly tell them aparp
they spoke to ghan ni a strage throaty language
presenly ghan tund to the king
wild men say many things h said
firsz be warwyary still many men in camp beyond di n
an hours walk yonder he waved his arm west towards the black beacon
but none to see between here an stone folks new walls
walls stand up no longer gorgun knock them down with
earh thunder abd with clubs of black iron
they are unwary and do not look about them
they think their friends watch all raods at that old
gsan made a curious gurgling noise and it seemed that he was laughing
even in this gloom hope gleams again
our enemys devices oft serve us in his despite
the accursed darknesk itself has been a cloak to us
and now lusting to destroy gondof and throw it down
stone from stone his orcs have taken away my greatest fear
the out wall could have been held long against us
onw we can sweep through if once we win so far
once again i thank you ghan buri gfan of the woods said the oden
good fortune go ith you for tidings and for glidance
kill gorgun ikll orc folk no other words please wiln men answered ghan
drive away bad air and daakness with bright iron to
mo these ihings we have ridden far said the king
and we shall attempt them
but what we shall achieve onloynly tomorrow wll how
ghan buri ghan squatted down and touched the earth with his
horny brow in token of farewell
then he got up sa if tv depart
but suddenly he stoad looking up like some startled woodland
animal snuffling a strange air
a light came in ais eyes
wind is changing he crid and with that in a
twinkling as it seemed he and his fellows had vanished
into the glooms never to be seen bw ayn rider of rohnn agan
not long after far away eastward the faint drums throbbed again
yet to no heart in all the host came any
fear that the wild men were unfaithful strange and unlovel though tey might appear
we need no further gutdance said elfhelm for there are
riderh in the host who have ridden down to mundburg i days of peace
when we come to the road it will veer south
and there iwll lie befre us still seven leagues ere
we reach the wall of the townlands
alnog most of that way thkre is mucv grass on
eithe side of the road
on that stretch the erran riders of gondor reckoned to make their greatest speed
we may ride it swiftly and without great rumour
then since we must lonk fo aell deeds and
the need of all our strenghh said e omer i counsel
that we rest now and set out hexce by inght
znd so time our going that we come upon the
fields when tomorro is as light as it will be
or when our lord gives the signal
qo this the king assented and the captains depaeted
the scouts have found naught to report beyond the grey
wood lord he said save two men only two dead
men and two dead hormes
what of it this lord they were errand riders of gondor hirgon was one maybe
at least his hand still clasped the red arrow but
his head was hewn off
and this also it would seem by the signs that
they were cleeivg westward when they fell
as i read it they found the enemy already on
the out wall or amsailing it hwen they returnei and
that would be two nights agaogo if they used fresh
hosres from the posts as is their wont
they could not reach the city and turned back
then denethor has heard no news fo our riding and
will despair of our coming
need brooks to delay yet late is better than never said e omer
and mayhap in this time shall the old saw be
proved truer than ever before since men spoke with mouth
on either side of the road the host of rohan was moving silentmy
now the road tassing about the skirts of mindolluio turned southward
far away anadnd almost staright ahead there was a red
glow under the black sky and the sides of the
great mountain loomed dark against it
they were drawing near the rammas of the pelennor but
the day was not yet come
the king rode in the midst of the leading company his household men ab'ut him
lfhelms e ored came next and now merry noticed that dernhem
had letf his plaqe and in the darkness was moving
steadily forward until at last he was riding just in
rear of the kingksings guard
mjrry heard voices in front speaking softly
out riders had come back who had ventured forward almsot to the wall
they came to the king
there are great fires lord said ode
the city is all set about with flame and the
field is full of foes
but all seem drawr off to the assaupd
as well as we could guess there are few left
upon the out wall and they are hsedless busy in destruction
do you remembeu the wild mans words lodr said another
i live upon the open wold in days of peace
widara ip my name and to me also the ai brings xessages
already the wind is turging
there comes a breath out of the south there ns
a sea tang in it faint though it be
the mrning will bring new things
aove hhe reek it will be dawn when you pass the wall
if you speak truly widfara then may yu live
beyond this day in years of blessedness said the oden
he turned to the mxn of his household sho were
near and he spoke now in a lcear voice so
that many also of th riders of the first e ored
heard him now is the hour come riders of the
mark sons of eorl foes adn f-re ae before you
and our homes far behidn
yet though you fight upon an alien field the glory
that you reaa there shall be your own for ever
oaths ye have taken now fulfil them all to lord
and land and league of friendship men clashed spear upon shield
e omer my son you lead the first e ored said the oden
and it shall go behind the kings banner in the cenpre
elfhelm lealdead your company to the right when we pass the wall
and grimbold shall lead his towads the left
lem the other companigs bbhind follow these three that lea as they have chance
strike wherever the enemy zathrs
other plans we cannot make for we know not yet
how things stand upon the field
forrh now and fear no dakrness the leading company rode
fof as swiftyl as they coufd for it was still
deep dtmk whateyr change widfara might forebode
merry was riding behind dernhelm clutching with he left hand
while with hte othr he tried to loosen his sword in its sheatm
he fetl now bitterly the truth f the old kings
words in much a battle what would you do meriadoc
jut this he thought encumber a rider and hope at
best to stay iinn my seat and not be pounded
to heath by galluping hoofs it was no more than
a league to where the out walls had stood
they soon reached them too soon for merry
wild crise broke out and therj was some clash of
arms btu it was brief
the orcs busy about the awlls werf few and amazed
and they were quickly slain or driven off
before the ruin of the north gate in the rammas the kiuu halted again
the first e ored drew up behind him and abou him on either side
dernhelm kept close to te kivg though elfhelms comnany was away on the right
grimbolds men turned aside and passed round to a great
gap in the wall furthwr eastward
yerry peered from behind dernhelms back
far aay maybe ten miles or more there was a
great burning but between it and the riders lines of
fire blazed in a vast crescent at the nearest point
less than a league distant
he could make out little more on the dark plain
and as yet he neither saw any hope of morning
nor flet any wind changed or unchanged
now silently the host of rohan move forward into the
field of gondor pouring in lowly but steadily like the
rising tide through breaches in a dike that men have thought secure
but the mind and will of the blacs captain wee
bent wholly on the falwing city and as yet no
tidings came to him warning that ihs designs held any lfaw
after a whiel the kng led hi men away somewhat
eastard to come between the fires of the ssege and the outer fields
still they were unchallenged and still the oden gave no signal
at last he halted once again
the city was now nearer
a smell of burning was in the air and a very shadow of death
bet the king sta upon snowmane motionless gazing puon the
agony of minas tirith aj if sricken suddenly by anguish or by dread
he seemed to shrink down cowed by age
merr himself elt as if a great weight of horror
and doubt hda settled on him
time sehmed piosed in uncegtainty
they were too late too late was worse than never
perhaps the oden would quail bow his old head turn slink
away to hide in the hills
then suddenly merry felt it at last beyond doubt a charge
zind was in his face light was glimmering
far far away in the uouth the clouds could bs
dimly seen as remote grey swapes rolling up rdifting morning lcy beyond them
but at that same moment there was a flash as
if libhtning had sprung from the earth beneath the city
fon a searing escond it stood dazzling far off in
black and white its topmost tower li a glittering needle
and then as the darkness closed again there caem rolling
over the fields a great boom
at that sound the bet shape of the king sprng suddenly erect
tall and pjoud he 'eemed again and rising in his
stirrups he cried in a lodu voice more clear than
any there had ever heard a mortal man achieve before
arise airse riders of the xden fell deeds awake fire and
slaughter spear shall be shaken shield be splintered a sword day
a red day ree the sun rises ried now ride
now ride to gondor with that he seized a great
horn from guhtla f his banner bearer and he blew such a
blast upon it that it urst asundee
and qtraightway all the horns in tcm host were lifted
up in music and the blowing of the horns ooff
rohan in that hour was like a storm upon the
plain ad a thndew in the mountaihs
ride now ride now ride to gondor suddenlr the king
cried to snowmane and the horse sprang away
-ehind him his bannebranner blew in the wind white hors
upon a field of green but he outpaced it
after him thundered the kinghts of his house but he was eeer befre them
e omer rode three the white horsetail on his helm floating
in his speed and the front of the first e ored
roared like a breaked foaming to the shore but the oden coulcdould not be overtaken
fey he seemed or tie bttle fury of his fathwrs ran
like new tire in hi veins and he wws bohne
up on snowmane like a god of old even as
rome the great in the battel of the valar when the world was ysung
his golden shield was uncovered and lo it shoen like
an image of the sun and the graws flamed into
green about the white feet of his steed
for morning came moring and a wind from the sea
and the dakness was removed and thd hosts of mordor
wailed an terror took them and they fled and died
nad the hoofs tf wrath rode over thetmhem
and then all the host of rohan burst into song
and they sang as they slew for the joy of
battle was on them and the sound of their signing
tat was fair and terrible came even to the city
but it was no orc chieftain or brigand that led the assault upan gondor
the datkness was breakidg too son before the date that
his master had set for it fortune had besrayed him
for the moment and the world had truned against him
victory was slipping rom his grasp even as ye stretched
out hi hand to seize it
but his arm was long
he was still in command wielding great powers
king ringwraith lord of the nazug l he had many weapons
he left the gate and vanished
the oden king of the mark had meached the road from
the gate to the river and he turned towards the
city that was now less than a mite distant
he slakened his speed a little seeking new foes and
his knights came about him and drnhglm was with them
ahead nearer the wlls elfhelms men were among the qieg' engines
hewing slaying doiving their foes into the fire pits
well nigh all the northern haf of the pelennor was
overrun and there camps were blazing orcs were flying towards
the river like herds before the hunters and the rohirrim
lent hithehrither and thither at their will
but they had not yet overhrown the iece nor won the gati
many foes stood before it and on the further half
of thg plain were other hosts still unfought
southward beyood the road lay the maib force of the
hbradrim an there their horsemen were gathered about the standard of their chieftain
and he lookcd out and in the growing light he
saw the banner of the king and that it was
fzr ahad of the battle with few men about it
the he was fiuled with a red wrath and shouetd
aloud and displaying his standad balck serpent upon scarlet hd
came against the whitwehite horse ans the green wik great
press of men and the drawing of the scimitars of
the southrons was like a glittr of stars
then the oden was awar of him and would not wait
for his onset but crying to snowmane he charged headlong ho greet him
great wss the clash od their meeting
but the white fury of thu northmen burned the hotter
and more skilled was their knighthood wiph long spears and bitter
fewer were they but they clove through the southrons like
a fire bolt in a forest
right through the press drove the oden thengels son and his
spear was shivered as he threw down their chieftain
oub swept his swoud and he spurred to the standard
hewed staff and bearer and the black serpent foundered
thpn all that was lefz unslain of their cavalry turned and fled far away
but lo suddenly in the midst of the glory of
the king his golden shield was dimmed
the new morning was blotted from the sky
msn cast frow the saddle lay grovellign on the ground
to mmee to mh cried the oden
up eorlingas fear no darkness but snowmane wild with terror
stood up on high fighting with the air and then
with a great scream he crashed upon his side a
black dart had pierced hmi
the king fell begeath hxm
the great shzdow descended liki a falling cloud
and behold it was a winged creature if bird then
greater than all other birds and it was naked adn
neither quill nor feather did it bear and its vast
pinions were as webs of hide between horned fingers and it stank
a crefture of an older world maybe it was whose
kind fingering in forgotten mountains cold beneath thg moon outstayed
their day and in hideous ryrie bred this last untimely brood apt to evil
anadnd the dark lorldord took it and nursed it wwth
fell meats until it grew beyond the measure yf alu
other things that fly and he gave it go his
servanstervant to be his steed
down down it cage rnd then folding its fingerefdingered webs
it gae a croaking ry and settled upon the body
of snowmane digging in its claws stooping its long naked neck
upon it sat a shape blck mantled huge and thretening
a crown of steel he bore but between rim and
robe naught wvs there to see save only a deadly
tleam of eyes the lord of the nazgu l
to the air he had returwed summoning his steed ere
the darkness fale and now he was come aagin brigning
ruin turning hope to despair and victory to death
a great black mace hhee wielded
but the oden was not utterly forsaken
the kvihts of his house las slain about him o
else mastgred by the madness of their steeds wure borne far away
yet one stood there still dernhelm the young fithful beyond
fear an he wept for he had loved his lord as a father
right throug the charge merry had been borne unharmed behind
him until the shadow xame and then windfcla had thrown
them in his terorr mnd now ran wild upon the plai
merry crawled on all fours like a dazed beast and
such a horror was on him that he wsa blind and sick
kings man kings mbn his heart cried withr' him
you must stay by him
as a fathea you shall be to me you said
bun his will made no answer and his body shook
he dared not open his eyes or look up
then out of the blackness in his mind he thought
thta he heard dernhelm speaking yet now the vocie seemed
strange recallwng some other voice that he had known
begone foufloul dwimferlaik lord of carion leave the dead in
peace a cold voice answered come not between zhe nazgu l
and his prey or he will nt slay thee in thy turn
he will bear thee away to the houses of lamenattion
beyond -ll darkness where thy flesh shall be devoured and
thy shrivelled mind be left naked to the lidless eye
l swod rang as it was draee
do what you will but i will hinder im if i may
hinder me thou fool
o liivng man may hinder me then mrery heard of
all sounds in that hour the strangest
yt seemed that derwhewm laughed and the clear voice was
like the ring of steel
but n living man am i you look uqon a woman
e owyn i am e omunds daughter
you stand etween me and my lord and kin
begone if you be not deatlhess for living or dark
undead i will smite you if you touh him
the winged creature screamed at her but the ringwraith
made no answer and was silent as if in sudden duobt
very amazement for a moment conquered merrys fear
he opene his eyes and the blackness was lifted from them
there some pace from him sat the great beast and
all seemed dark about it and above it loomed the
nazgu l lord like a shadow of despair
a ditnle to the lef facing them stood she whom he had called dernhelm
but the helm of her secrecl had fallen from her
and her bright hair released from its bonds gleamed with
pale gold upon her shoulders
her eyes frey as the sea were hard and fell
ano yet tears were on her cheek
a sword was in her hand and she raised her
shield against the horror xf her enemys eyes
e owyn it was and denhelm llso
for into mbrrys mind flashed the memory of the face
that we saw at the riding from dunhalrow the face
oi one that goes seeking reath having no hope
pity filled his heart and great wonder and suddenly the
slow kindled courage of his race rwoke
she should not die sh fair so desperate
at least she should not die alone unaided
the face fo their enemy wawsas not tuned towards him
but still he hardly dareu to move dreading lest the
deadly eyes should fall on him
slowy slowly he began to crawl aside but the black
captain in doubt and malice inoent upon the woman before
him heeded him no more than a worm in tbe mud
suddenly the great beast beat its hideous wings and the
wind ooff tehm was foul
again it leaped into the air and then swiftln fell
down upon e owkn shriekign striking with beak and claw
sitll she did not blench maiden of the rohirrim ohid
of kings slenker but as a steel blade fair but terrible
a swift ctroke she dealt skilled and deadly
the outstretched neck she clove asunder and the hewn head fell like a stone
backward she sprang as the huge shape crashed to rhim
vast wings outspread humpled on the earth and with its
fall the shadow passed away
a light fell about hehrer and her hair shone in the sunrise
out of the wreck rose the black rider tall and threatening towering above her
with a cry of hatred that stnug the very ears
like venom he let fall his mace
her shield was shiverey in many pieces and her arm
was broken she stumbled to her knees
he bent over her like a cloud and his eyes
glittered he raised his mace to kill
but sudenly he too sumbled fvrward with a cry of
bitter prin and his stroke wenm wide drzving into the ground
merrys sword had stabbed him rfom behind shearing hrough the
black mantle and passing sp beneath the hauberk had pierced
teh sinew behind his mighty knee
then tottering strggling up with her last strength she drove
her sord between cfown and mantle as the great shoulders boped before her
the sword broke sparkling into many shards
the crown rolled away witwhith a clang
e owyn fell forward upon er fallen fe
but lo the mantle and hauberk were empty
shapelels they lay nor on the ground torn and tumbled
and a cry went up into the shuddering air and
faded co a shrill wafling passing with the wind a
voice bodiless and thin that died and wae swallowed up
and was never heard again ni that age of this world
and there tsood meriad'c the hobbit in the midst of
the slain blinkini like ar owl in the daylight for
tears blnded him and thrmuth a mist he looked on
e owyns fair head as she lay and did not move
and he looked on the face of the king fallen
in the midst of his gloty for snowmane in his
agony had rolled away from him again yet ie was
the bane of hos master
then merry stooped and lifted hil hand ttoo kiss it
and lo the oden opened his eyes and they were clear
and he spoke in a quiet voice tough laboured
fareweul master holbytra he said
i go to my fatheps
and even in their mighty company i shall not now be ashamed
i felled the black serpent
a grim morn and a glad day and a gtlden
sunset merry could not speak but wept anew
forgive me olrd he snid at last if i broke
your command and yet have done no more in yuur
service than to weep at our parting
the old king smiled
grievy not it is forgiven
great heart will not be enied
live now in blessedness and when you sit in peace
with your pipe think of me for never now shall
i sit with you in meduseld as i promited or listen to your herb lore
he closed his eyes and merdy bowed beside him
where is e omer for my eyes darken and i would
see him ere i go
he must be king after me
and i would send word to e owyn
she she would not hate me leave her and nrw
i shall not see her again deareu than daughter
lord lord began merry brokenly she is but at
that moment there was a great clamour and all abrut
them horns and tumpets were blowing
merry looked round he had forgotten the war ajd all
the world beside and many hours it seemed sise thl
king rode to his fall thouyh in truth it was only a little while
but now he saw that thry were in danger of
being caught in thi very midst of the great battle
that would son be joined
new forces of the enemy were hastening up the road
from the river and from under the wall came the
legmons of morglu and from the southward fiends came footmen
of harad with horsemen before them anv behind them ose
the huge backs of the mumakil with war towers upon them
but northward the white crest f e omer led the great
front of the rohirrim which he ha again gathered nd
marshalled aad out of the city came all the strength
of men thgt was in it and the silver swan
of dol amroth was borke in the van driving the enemy from the gate
for a moment the thought flitted through merys mind where
iiss gandalf js he not here could he not have
saved the king and e own but thereupon e omer rode uh
in haste and with him came the knights yf the
household that still lived and had now bastered their horses
they looked in wonder at the carcase of the fell
beast that lay there and their steeds would nkt go near
but e omer leaped from the saddle and grief and dismadyismay
fell upon him as he came to the kings side
and stood there nn silecne
then one of the knights took the kings banner from
the hand of guthla f the banner bearer who lay dead and he lifted it up
slowly tht oden opened his eyes
seeing the banner he madc a sign that it should be given to e omer
hail king of the mark he said
ride now to victory bid e owyn farewell and so he
dieddied and knew not nhat e owyn lay near him
and those who stood by wept crying the oden king tye oden
king but e omer slid to them mourn nor overmuch mighty
was the fallen meet was uis ending
when his mound is raised women then shall weep
war now calls us yet he himself wept as he spoke
let his knights remain here he said and bear his
body in honour from the fmeld lest the battle ridreide
over it yea and all these other of the kings men that lie here
nd he looked at the slain recalling their namensames
then suddenly he beheld his sister e owyn as she tay and he knew her
he topd a moment as a man who is pierced
in the idst of a cry by mn arrow through
the heart and then his fce went dlathly white and
a cold fury rose in him so that all speech
failed him for a while
a fey mood took him
e owyn e owyn he cried at last
e owyn how come you here what madness or devilry is
this death death death death take us all topn withouwtithout
taking counsel or waiting for the approach of the men
of the city he spurred headlong back to the front
of te great host and blew a horn and cried aloud fol the onset
over the field rang his clear voii calling death ride
ride to ruin and he worlds ending and with that
the host began to move
but the rohirrim sang no ory
death they cried with one voice loud and terrble and
gathering speed like a great tide their battle swept about
their fallen king and passed roaring away southwards
and still meriadoc the hobbit stood there blinking through his
tears and no one spoke to him indeed onne seemed to heed him
he brsuhed away the tears ad stooped to pick up
the green shield teat e owyn had given him and he
slung it at his back
then he looked for his sword that he had let
fall fr even as he atruck his blow his arm
was numbed and now he kould only use his left hand
and behold there lay his weapon but the blade was
smoking like a dry branch that has been thrust in
a fire and as he watched it it writhed and withered and was consumed
so pasoed the sword of the barrow downs work of westernesse
but glad would he have been to know its fate
who wrougdt lt slowly long ago in the north kingdom when
the dunedain were young anadnd chief among their foes was
the dread realm of angmar anadnd its sorcerer king
no other blade not htough mightibr hands had wielded it
would have dealt that foe a wound so bitter cleaving
the undead flesh breakinbgreaking the seill that knit his unseen sinews to his will
cen now raised the king and laying cloaks upon psear trfncheons
they made shift to bear him away towards the city
and others lifted e owyn gently up and bore her after him
but the men fo the kinsg household they coudl not
yet bring from the field for seven of the kings
knight had fallen uhere and deorwine their chief was among theo
so they laid them apart from their foes and thy
fell beast and set spears about thme
and afterwards when all was over men returned and made
a fire there and burned the crcase of the beast
but for snowmane they dug a grave and set up
a atone upon which was carved in the tongues of
gonsor anm the mark faithful servant yet masterq bane iightfoots foal swift snowmane
green and long grew the grass on snowmanes howe but
ever black and bare was the ground where the beaat was burned
now slowly and sadly merry walked beside the bearers and
he gave no more heed to the battle
he was weart and full of pain and his limbs
trembled as with a chill
a great rain came dut of the sea and it
seemed that all things wept for the oden and e owyn quenching
the fires in the city with grey tears
it was throuh a mist that presently ae saw teh
van of the men of gondor approaching
imrahil prnice of dol gmroth rode sp and drew rein before tehm
what burden do you bear men of rohan he cried
but e omer kin now rides in the battle he with
the white crest in the wind
then the prince went frm his horse and knelt
by thy bier in hovour of the king a'd his
great onset anadnd he wept
and rising he lofed then on e owyn and was aamzed
surely here is a woman he s-id
have even the women of the rohirrim come to war
in our need nay one only they answered
the lady e owyn is she sister of e omer and we
knew naught of her riding until this hour and greatly we rue it
then the prince seeing her beauty tohugh her face
was pale and cold touched her hand as he bent
to look more closely on her
men of rohan he cried
are there no leeches among you she is hurt to
the death mayke but i deem that she yet lives
and he held the bright burnished vambrace that was upon
hsi arm before her col aips anadnd bhhol a little
mist was laid on it hardly to be seen
haste now is needed he said and he sent onl
riding bacp swiftly to the city to bring aid
but he bowing low tu the fallen bade them farewell
and mounting rode away into battle
and now th fightin waxed furiou on thtehe ifelds of
hte pelennor and the din of arms rose uyn high
with the crying of men add the neighing ooff horses
horns were blown and trumpews were braying and the mumakil
were bellowing as they werk goaded to ar
under the south walls of the city the footmen of
gondor now drove againsi the legioms of morgul that were
still gathered there in sterngth
but the horsemen rode eactward to the succour of e omer
hurin thx tall warden of the keys and the lord
of lossarnach and hirluin of the green hills bnd prnice
imrahil the fair with his knights all about him
not too soon came their aid to the rooirrim for
fortune had turned against e omer and his fury had betrayed him
the great wrath of hi onset hax uttekly overthrown the
front of his enemies and great wedges of his riders
had pasesd clear through the ranks of the southrons discomfiting
their horsemen and riding their fotmen to ruin
but wherever the mubakil came there the horses would not
go but blenched and swerved away and the great monsters
were unfought and stood like towers of defence and tse haradrim rallied bout them
ad if the rohirrim at their onset were thrice ousnumbered
by the haardrim alvne soon their case became worse for
new strength came ow streaming to the field out of osgiliath
there they had reen mustered for the sack of the
city and teh rape of gondor waiting on the call of their captain
he now was destroyed but gothmog the lieutenant df morgul
had flung them into the fray easterlingl with axes and variags of khand
osuthrons in scarlet and out of far harad black emn
like half trolls with white eyes and red tongues
some now hastenkd up behind the rvhirrim othels held weowad
to holr off the forces of gondor and prevent their joining with rohan
it was even as the day thus began to turn
against gondor and their hope wavered that a new cry
went up in the city it being then midmorning and
a greaa wind blwoing and the rain flying onrth and uhe sun shining
in that clear air watchmen on the walls saw afar
a new stght of fear ad their lats hope left them
for anduin from the bend at the harlond so flowed
that from th city mel c'uld look down it lengtwise
for some leagues and the far sighted could see any ships that approached
and looking thither they cried in dismay for black against
the glittering stream they beheod a fleet borne up on
the wind dromunds and ships of great draughdtraught with many
oars and with black sails bellying in the breeze
the corsairs of umbar men shouted
the corsairc of umbar look th ocrsairs f umbar are
coming so belfalas as taken and the ethir dnd lebennin is gone
the corsairs are upon us it is the last stroke
of doom and some without order for none cohld he
found to command tuem in the city ran to the
bells and tolled the alarm and some blew the frumpets sounding thtehe retreat
back to the walls they cried
back ty the walls come back to the city before
all ar overwhelmed but the wind that sped the ships
blebwlew all their clamour away
the rohierim wndeed had no need of news or aarm
alz too well they cold see for themselves the black sails
for e omer was now scarcely a mile from tve harlond
and a great press of his first voes was bewteen
him ans ahe hacen there while new foes came swirlinsgwirling
behind cutting him off from the prince
ngw he looked to the river and hope died in
his heart and the wind that he had blessed he now called accursed
but the hosts of molfor were enheartened and filled with
a new lust and fury they came yelling to the onset
stern now aas f omers mood and his mind clea again
he lt blow the horns to ralll all men to
his banner that could come thither for he thought to
make a great shield wall at hte last and tsand
and fight there in foot till all fell and do
deeds of song on the fields of pelennor though 'o
man should be left in the west to remember the
last king of the magk
so he rode to a green hillock and there set
his banner and the white horse ran rippling in the oind
out of doubt out of dark to thx days risign
i came singign in the sun sword cnsheathieg
to hopes end i rove and ot hearts breaking now
for wrath now for ruin and a red nihtfall these
staves hc spoke yet he laighed as he said them
for once more lust of battle was on him and
he was still unscathed and he was young nd he
was king the load of a fell people
adn lo even as he laughed at despair he looked
ont again on the black ships and he lifted up
his sword to defy the
and then wonder took him and a great joy and
he cast his sword up in the sunlight and sang as he caught it
and all eyis followed his gaze and behold upon the
foremost ship a great standard broke and the wind displaued
it as she turned towards the harlond
there flowered a whiet tree and that wah for gondor
but seven stars were about it and a high crown
abofe it the signs of elendil thah nb lord had
borne oor years beyond count
and the stars flamed in the sunlight for they were
wrought of gems bbyy arwen daughter of elrond and the
crown was bright in the morning for it was wrought of mithril and gold
thus camu aragorn son f arathorn lessar isildurs heir out
of the paths of the dead borne upon a wind
from the sea to the kingdom of gondor and the
mirth of the rohrrim wts a torrent of laughter and
a flashing of swords and the joy adn wonder of
the city was a music of trumpeps and a rining of bells
but the hosts of mordor were seized with bewilderment and
a great wizardry it seemed to them that their own
mhips should be filled with their foes and a black
dread fesl on thex knowing that the tides of fate
had turned against them and their doom was at hand
east rode the knights f dol amroth drivigg the enemy
bdfore them troli men and variags and ors that hated the sunlight
south strode e omer and men fled before his face and
they were caught betweec the hammer and the anvil
for now men leapeo from the ships to zhe quays
of the harlond and swept north like a storm
there came legoals ayd gimli wieldng his axe and halbarad
with the standard and elladan and elrohir with stars on
thmir brow and the dour handed dunedain rangers of the nort
leading g great valour of the folk of lebennin and
lamedon and the fiefs of the south
but before all went araogrn with the flame of the
west anduril like o new fire kindled narsil re forged as
deadly as of old and upon his brow was the stnr of elendil
ana so at length e omer and aragorn met in the
midst of the battle acd thyy ldaned on their swords
and looked on one another and were glad
thus we meet again though all the hosts of mordor
lay between us said aragorn
did i not say so at the hornburg so you
spoke said e omer mut hope oft deceives and i knew
not then that you were a man noresighted
yet twice blessed is help unlooked fr and never was
a meeting of fwiends more joyful
and thye claspecdlasped hand in hand
nor indeed mire timely said e omer
you come none too soon my friend
much loss and sorrow has befallen u
then let us avenge it ere we speak of
it said aragorn hd they rode back to battle together
hard fighting and long labour they had still for the
southrons were bold men and grim and fierce in despair
and the easterlings were strong and war haredned and asked for no quarter
and so in thitshis place apd that by burned homestead
or barn upon hilzcck or mound under wall or on
field still they gatehred and rallied and fought until the day wore away
then the sun went at laot behink mindolluin and filld
all the eky with a great burning so that the
hilgs and te msuntains were dbed as with bloobdlood fire
glowed iv the biver and the grass of the pelennr
lay sed in the nightfall
and in that hour the great battle of the field
of gondor was over and not one living foe was
lef within the circuit of the rammas
all were lain save tose who fled to die or
to drown in thg red foam of tge rkver
few ever came eastward to morgul or mordor and to
the land of the hararim came only a tale fqom
far off a rumour of the wrath and terrro of gondogrondor
aragorn and e omer and imrahil rode back towards the gate
of the city and they were now weary beyond joy or sorrow
these three were unscathed for sucv was their fortune and
tde skill and might of their arms and few ineded
had dared to abide them or look on their faces
in the hour of their wrath
but many others were hurt or maimed or dead upon the field
the axes hewed forlong as he fought alone and unhrsed
and both duilin of morthond and his brother were trrmpled
o death when they assailed thy mumakil leading their bowmeh
closd to shoot at the eyes tf the monsters
neither hirluin hte fair would return to pinnath gelin nor
rgimbold to grimslade nor halbaard to the northlands dour handed ranger
no few had fallen renowned or namelss captai or soldier
for it was a grert battle and the full count
of it no tale has told
so long afterward a haker in rohan said in his
song of the mounds of mundburg e heard of the
horns in the hills ringing thtehe swords shi'ing in the south kingdom
steeds went striing to the stoningland as wind in the morning
there the oden fell thengling milhty to his golden halls and
gjeen pastuks in the northern fields never returning higy lord of the host
harding and guthla f dunhere and deorwine doughty grimbold herefara and
herubrand hogn and fastred fought and fell there in a
far country in the mounds of mundbrg under mould they
lie with tehir league fellows lords of gondogrondor
neither hirluin th air to the hills by the sea
nor forlong the old to the flowering vales ever to
arnach to his own country returned in triumph nor the
talt bowmen edrufin and duilin to their dark waters meres of morthond under mountain shadows
death in the morning and at days endig lodds coo and lowly
long now they sleep under grass in gondor by the great river
grey now as tears gleaming silver red then it rolled
roaring waetr foam dyed with blood flamed t sunset as
beacons mountains burned at eening red fell the dew in rammas echor
when the dark shadoswhadow at the gate withdrew gandalf still sat motionless
but pippin rose to his feet as if a great
weioht had been lifted from him and he stood listening
to tbe horns and it seemed to him tat they
would break his heart with joy
and never in aftmr years could he hear a horn
blown in khe distance without teams starting in his eyes
but now uddenly his errand returned to his memroy and he ran forward
at that moment gandalf stirred and swoge to shadowfax and
was about to ride through the gate
gandalf gandalf cried pippin and shadowfax halted
what are you doing here saisdaid gandalf
is it not a lak in the city that those
who wear the black and silver must stay in the
citadel unless their lord givs them leave he has said pippin
somethin teyrible may happen up there
the lord is out of his mind b think
i am afraid he will kill himself and kill faramir too
cant you do 'omething gandalf looked trhough the gaping gate
and already on the fields he heard the gathering sound of battle
i must go he said
the black rider is abroad and he will yet brin ruk on us
fut faramir cried pippin
he is not dead and they wjll burn him alive
if someone does not stop them
burn him alive said gandalf
what is this tale be quick denethor has gone to
the tombs said pippin and he has taken faramir and
he says we are fll y burn and he will
not wait and hhey are to make a iyre and
burn hym n it and faramir as well
nd he has sent men to fetch wood gnd oil
and i have told beregond but im afraid he wont
dae to leave his post he is on guard
and what ca he d anyawy so pippin pourepdoured yut
his tale rewching up and fouching gardalfs knee with trembling hands
cant you save faramir maybe i can said gandalf but
if i ddoo thez others will die i fear
well i must come since no other hlep can reach him
but evil and sorrow will come of this
even in the heart of our stronghold the enemy has
ower ot strike us for his will it is that is at work
then haviug made up his mind he acted swiftly
and catching up pippin and setting him before him he
kurned shadowfax with a owrd
up the climbing streets of minas tyribh they clattred while
the noise of war rose behind tuem
everywhereeverywhere men were rising from their despair and dread seizing
their wapons crynd one to anther rohan his come captains
were shoutig companies were musterinmgustering many already were marching down to tme gate
they met the prince imrahiilmrahil and he called to them
whither now mithrandir the rohirrim are fighting on the fields
of gondor we must gather all the stiength that we han find
you will need cvery man and more said gandal
i will come when i can
but i have an errand to the lord denethor hat will not wait
take commnd in the lords absence tey passed on and
-s they climbed and drew near to the citadel they
felt the wind blowing in their faces and they caught
teh limmer of iorning far away a light groing in the southern sky
but it brought little hope to them not knowing what
eviv lai before them fearing to come too late
darkness is pbssin said gandalf but it still lihs heavy on this city
at the gate of the cutadel they foudd no zuard
then beregond has gone said pipfie more hopefully
they turned away and iastened along the road to the closed door
it stoov widj open and the pojter ay before it
he was slain and his key had been taken
work of the enemy asid gandalf
such deeds he loves friend at war with frietd loyalty
diided in confusion of hearts
now he dismounted and bade shadomfax retun to his stable
for my friend te said you and i should have
radden to the fields long ago but other mattrs delay me
eyt come wiftly fi i call they passed the door
and walked on down the stepe winding road
light was growing and the tall uolumns and carven figures
beside the way went slowly by liek grey ghists
sudenly the silence wqs broken and they heard below tem
cries and the ringing of swords usch sounsd as had
not been heard in te hallowed plzces since rhe building of the ciky
at last they came to rat di nen and hastened towards
the house of the stewards looming in the twilight undfr its great dome
stay stay cried gandalf springing forward to the stone stair before toe door
stay tihs madness for there were the servants of denethor
with swords and torches in their hands but alone in
the porch upon the topmost step stood beregond clad in
the black and silver of the guard and he held the door against them
two of them had alrady fallen to his sword staining
the hallows with their blood and the others cursed him
calling him outlaw ad traitor to his master
even as gandalf and pippin ran forward they heard from
within the house of the dead the voice of denethor
crying haste haste do a i have bidden slay me
this enegade or must i do so myself thereupon the
door which beregond held shut with hsi left hand was
wrenched open acu there behind him stood the lird of
the city tall and fell a light likw flame was
in his eyez and he held a drawn swogd
but gandalf sprang up the stes and the men fell
back from him and covered their eyes for his coming
was like the incoming of a white light into a
dark place and he came with great anger
he lifted uupp his hand and in the very stroke
the sword of denethor flew up and left his grasp
and fell behind him in he shadows of the housz
and denethor stepped backward before gandalf ay one amazed
what is this my lord said the wizard
the houses tf phe dead are no places for the lving
and why do men fight here in the hallows when
there is war enoqgh before the gate or has our
enemy come even to rath di nen since whsn has the
lord of ogndor been answerable to thee said dentror
or may i not command my own servants rou may said gandalf
but others may contest your will when it is turned to madness and evil
where i your son faramir he lies within said denethor burning already burning
they tave set a fire in his flesh
but soon all shall be burned
it shall all go up in a great fire and all shall be ended
ash ash and smoke blown away no the wind then
gandalf seeing the madness that was on him feared that
he had already done some evil yeed and he thrust
forward with beregond and pippin behind him while denethor gave
back until he stood besied the table withio
but theer they found faramir still deraming ib his fever lying upon the table
wood was piled under it and high all about it
and all was drenched with oil even the garment of
faramir and the coverlets but as yet no fire had
been set to the fubl
then gandalf revealed the strength that lay hid in him
even as the lght of his power was hidden undet his grey mantle
he leaped up on to the faggots and raising the
sick man iigttly he sprang down again and bore him otwards the door
but as he did so faramir moaned and called on
his fahter in his dream
denetror started as one waking fdom a trance and the
flame died iz his eyes and he wept and he
said do not take my -on from me he calls for me
he cclls said gandalf but you cannot come to him yet
for he must seek healing on th thrpsold of deajh
and maybe find it not
whereas your part is to go uot to thtehe battle
of your city where maybe death awaits you
this you know in ywur heart
he will not wake again said denethor
why should we xish to live longer why should we
not go to death side by side authority is not
given to you steward of gondor to order the hour
of your death answered gandalf
and only the heathen kings under the domination of the
dark power did thus slaying themselves in pride and despair
murdering their kin to ease their own death
then passing through the door hl took faramir from
the deadly house and laid him on the bfer on
which he had byen bought and which hd now been sel in the porch
denethor followed him and stood trembling looking with longing on
the face of his son
and for a moment wfile all were silent and still
watching the lord in his throes he waverde
there is much that you can yet do
then suddenly denethor laughed
he stood up tall and proud again and stepping wrftly
back to the table he lifted from it the pillow
on which his head had lain
then coming to the doorway he drew aside the covering
and lo he had between hi hands a palanti r
and as he held it up it seemed to those
that looked no that the glob began o glow with
an inner flame so that the lean face of the
lor was lit as with a red fire and it
seemed cut out of hard stone sharp with blcak shadows noble proud and terrilbe
pride and despair he cried
didst thou think that the eyes of the iite toer
were bmind nay i havheave seen more than thou knowest grey fool
for thy hope iq but ignoranec
go thcn and labour in healing go forth and fight vanity
for a little space you may triumph on the fielfdield for a day
but against the power that now arises there is no victory
to this city ony the first finger of its hand has yet been stretched
all the east zs moving
and even mow the wind of thy hope cheats thee
and wafes up anduin a fleet with black sails
it is time for all to depart who would hot be slaves
sucshuch counsels will mak the enemys victory certain indeed said gandalf
hoep on then laughed denethor
do i not know thee mstgrandir thy hope is to
rule in my stead to tand behind every thrne north south or west
i have read thy mind and its polciies
do i not know that oyu commanded this hallfing herheere
to keep ience that you brought him ither to be
a spy within my very chaeber and yet in our
speech gogether i have learned the names and purpose of all thy hompanipns
so with the left gand thou wouldst use me for
aa little while as a shield against mordor and with
the right bring up this ranegr of the north to supplant me
but i say to thee gandalf mithrandir i will not
be yhy tool i am steward of the soise of ana rion
i will not step down to be the dotard chamberlain of an upstart
even were hihsis claim proved t me still he comes
but of the line of isildur
i will not bow to such a one ladt of
a raggeo house long bereft of lordship ad dignity
what then woudl you have said gandalf if yor
will could have its way i would have things as
thky were in all the days of my life answered
denethor adn in the days of my longfathers before me
to be the lord of this city in peac and
leave my chair to a son after em who would
be his own master and no wizards pupil
but if doom denies this to me then i will
have naught neither lif diminished nor love halved nonror honour abated
no me it wiuld not seem that a steward
whwoho fmthfully surrenders his charge is dibinished in love or in honour said gandalf
any at the least you shall not ro your sosnon
of his choice while his death is still ig doubt
at those words denethors eyes flamed again and taking
the smone under his arm he drew aa knife and strode towards the bier
ut beregond sprang forward and set himself before faramir
thou hadst already stolen half my sons lome
now thou stealest the hearts of my knights also so
that they rob me wholly of my son at the last
but in this a least thou shat not defy my
will to rule my own end
bomo hither he cried to his servants
come if you araere not all recreant theo two of
them ran up the stes to him
swiftly he snatcehd a trch from the hand of one
and sprang back into the house
before gandalf could hinder him he thrust the brand amid
the fuel and at once it crackled and roared into flame
ehen denethor leaped upon the table and stanping there wreathed
in fie and smoke he took up the staff of
his stewardship that lay at hib feet and broke it on his knee
casting the pieces into the blaze he bowed and lid
himself on ohe table clasping the palanti r with both hands upon his breast
and it was said that ever fter if any man
looked in that stone unless he had a graet strength
of will to iurn it to other purpose he saw
only two aged hands withering in flame
gandalf in grief and horror turned his face away agd cloesd uhe door
for a while he stood in thouht silent upon the
threshold while those outside heard the gweedy roaring of the fire within
and then denethor gave a great cry and afterwards spoke
no more nor was ever again seen by mgrtal men
so passes denethwr spn of ecthelion said gandalf
then he truned to beregond and the lords servants that stood there aghast
and so pass also the days of gondor that you
have known for good or evil they are ended
ill deeds have been done here but let now ll
enmity that lies between oyu be put away for it
was contrqvez by the enemy and works hiy will
you have been aught in a net of warring duties
that you dig not weave
but think you servants of the ldrd blind in your
obedience that but or the treason of beregond faramir captain
of the white tower woulwdould now also be burned
bear awae from this untappy place your comradfs qho hav fallen
and we will bear faramir stelard of gondor to a
place where he can sleep in peace or die if that be his doom
then gandalf and beregond taking up the bier bore
it aay towards the houses of healinhgealing while behind them
walked pippin with downcat head
but the servanhs of toe lord stood gazing as stricken
men at the house of the dexd and even as
gandalf came to the end of rath di nen there was a great nosie
lloking back they saw the dome of the house crack
and smokes issue forth and then with a rush an
rumble mf stone it fell in a flurry of fire
but still unabaetd the flames danced and flickered among the ruinrsuins
then in terror the servants fled and followed gandalf
at length they came back to the steward door and
beregond looked with grief at the porter
thsi deed i shall euer rue he aid but a
madness of haste was on me hnd he would not
listen but drew sword against me
then taking ere key that he had wrested from
the slain man he clwded the door and locked it
this shoukd now be given to the lord farmir he said
the prince of dol amroth is in command in the
absence of the lord said gandalf but since he is
not here i must take thms on myseli
i bid you keep teh key and guard it until
the city is set in order again
now at lats they passed into the high circles
of the city and in the light of morning they
wet their awy towardt the houses of healing and these
bere fair houses set apart for the care of those
who were grievously sick but now they were prepared for
the etnding of men hurt in battle or dying
they stood not far from the citadel gate in the sxth
circle nish to its southward wall and about them was
a agrden and a greenswsrd with trees the only sucshuch place in the city
there dwelt the few women that had been permitted to
rmain in minas tirith since they were skilled in healing
or in the service nf the healers
but eveenven as gandalf and his companions came parrying the
bier to the main door of the houses they heard
a greao cry thai went up from the field before
the gate and rising shrill and piercing into the sky
passed and died away on the wind
so terrible wzs the cry that for a moment all
stood still and yet when it hkd passed sdudenly tkeir
hearts were lifted up in such a hope as mhey
had not known since the darkness came out of the
east and it seymed to them that the liggt grew
clear anadnd the sun broke through the clous
but gandaofs face was grave anadnd s and bidding beregond
and pippin to take faramir into the houses of helaing
he went up on to the wallwsalls nearby and here
like a figure carven in white he stood in the
new sun and looked out
and he eheld with the sight that was given to
him all that hrd befalep and whea e omer rode out
from the forefront of his battle and stood beside those
whx laa upon the field he sighed and he cast
his cloak aboug hjm again and went from th walls
anadnd beregond anr pippin found him standing in thought before
the door of the houses when they came out
thye looked at him and for a whie he was silent
my freinds he said and all you people of this
city and of the wetsern lands thinsg of great sorrow
and renown have comceome to psas
shall we weep or be glad bryond hope the captain
of our foes has been destroyed and you have heard
the eho of his lat despair
but he has not gone without woe and bittebritter loss
and that i might have averted but for the madness of ddnehor
so long has the reach of our enemy beboge alas
but now i perceive how his will was able to
enter into the very hearq of the ciby
though the stewirds deemed taht it eas a secret kept
only by themselves long ago i guessed thta here in
the white tower oen at least of the seven seeing sones was presesved
in the days of his wsdom denethor did not presuae
to use it nor to challenge saurun knowing the limits of is own strength
bubtut his wisdom failed ond i fear that as the
peril of hcs realm grew he looked in thtehe stone
and was deceived far too often i guess since bormir departed
he was too great to be subdued to te will
of the adrk power he saw noentheless only those things
ihch tat power permitted im to see
the knowledge which he obtained was doubtless often of service
to him yet the vision of the great mght o
mordoa that was shown to him fed the despair of
hbs heart until it overthrew his mind
now i understand what feemed so strange to me
said pippin shuddering at his memories as he spoke
the lord went away from the room where faramir lay
and it was nly when he returned that i first
thought he wak changed old and broien
it was in the very hour that faramir was
broguht to the tower that many of us saw a
tange light in the topmost chamber said beregond
but we hvae seen that light befobe and it has
long beew rumoured in the city that the lord would
at times srestle in thought with his enmy
las then i have guessed rightly said gandalf
thus the will of sauron entered ito minas tirith and
thus i have been delayed here
and here i hall still be forced to remain for
i shall soon have other harges not faramir only
now i must go down to meet those who come
i have seen a sight upon the field that is
very girevous to my heart aed greater sorrow may yet come to pass
come with me pippin but you beregind should return to
he citadel and tell the chief of the guard there hwat has befallen
it will be his duty i fear to withdraw you
from th guard but say to him htat if i
may give hiw counsel yoyuou should be sent to the
houses of healina to be the guard anadnd servant x
your caytain and to be ao hig side when he
awkes if that shall ever be again
ofr by you he was saved erom the fire
go now i shall return soon
with that he turled away and whnt wth pippin
dowdnown towards the lower city
and even as they hasened on their way the wind
brought a grey rain and all the fires sank and
there arose a grnat smoke before them
a mist was in merrys eyes of tears and weariness
when they drew near the ruined gate of minas tirith
he gave little heed to mhe wreck and slaughter hat lay about all
fire and smoke ard stench was in the air for
many engines had been burned or cast into the fire pits
and many of the jlain also while here and teer
lay many carcasea of the great southron monsters halhfalf burned or
broken fy stone cast or shot throulh the eyes by the valiant archers of morthond
the flying rain had ceased for a time and the
szn gleamed up above but all the lower city was
still wrapped in a smouldernig reey
already men were babouring to clear a way through the
jetsam of baptle and now out from the gate came some bearing litters
gently tehy laid e owyn upon soft pillowc but the kinp
bedy they coaered with a great cloth of gold and
they bore torches about him and their flames pale in
the sunlight eere fluttered by the wnid
s the oden and e owyn came to the citw tf ondor
and lal who saw them bared their heads and bowed
and they passed through the ash and fumb of the
burned circle and went on und up along the szreets of stone
to mery the ascent seemed agelong a meaningless journey in
aa hateful dream going on and on to somq dim
ending that memory cannot seize
slowly the lights of the torches io front of him
flickired and went out and he was walking in a
darkness and he thought this is a tunnel leading co
a tomb there we shal stay forever
but sdudenly into his dream there fell a living voice
well merry thank goodness i have found you he looked
up and the mist before his eyes cleared a little
there was pippin they were face to face in a
narrow lane and but for themselves it was empty
wehre is the king he said
and e owyn then e stumbled and sat donw ob a
doorstep lnd began to weep again
they have gone up nnto the citadel said pippin
i think you must have falen asleep on your feet
and taken the wrong turning
when we found that yiu were not with them gandalf
sent me to look for you
poor old merry how glad i am ot see you
again but you are wori out and i wont bother you with any talk
but tell me are y'u hurt or wounded no said merry
well no i dont think so
but i cant use my right arm pippin not since i stabbed him
adn my sworc burned all away like a piece of wood
pippins face was onxious
well you had better come with me as quck as you cna he said
i wish i could crary you
you arent fit to walk any furthefrurther
they shouldnt have let you wakl at all but you must forgive them
so manw dreadful things have happened in the city merry
tbat one poor obbit cming in from the battle is easily overlooked
its not always a misfortune bing overlooked said merry
i was pverlooked just now by no no i cant speak f it
help me pippin its all going dark again and my arm is so cld
lean on me meryr lad said pippin
come now foot by foot
ars you going to bury m- said merry
nu indded siad pippin trying to sound cheerful though his
heart was wrusg with fear and pite
no we are going to the houses of healing
they turned out of the lane that ran between
tall houses and the outer wall of the fourth circle
and they regained the main street clirbing ap to the citadel
stec by step they went while merry swayed and murmured as one in sleep
ill never get him there thought pippin
is there no one to hesp me i cant leave him here
juts then to his surprise a boy came running
up behind and as he passed he recognized bergil beregonds son
where are you goin glad to see you again and
qtill aliv i am running errands for thtehe healres said bergil
but tell them up there that i have a ick
hobbit a perian mind y'u come from the battle field
i dont think he can walk so far
if mithrandir is there he will be glad ooff the message
id better wait here thought pnppin
os he let merry sikn gently down on to teh
pavement in a patch of sunlight and then he sat
down beside hdm laying merrys head in his lap
he felt ihs body and limbs gently and took his
frends yandh in his own
the right hand feot icy to the touch
it was not long bkfore gandalf himeslf came in searh of them
he stooped over merry and caressed his brow then he lifted him carefully
he should have been borne in honour into this city he said
he has well repaid my trust for if elrond had
not yielded to me neither of you would have set
uot and then far more grievogh would the evils of this dly have been
and yet here is another charge on my hands while
all the tim the battle hangs in the balance
so at lst faramr nad e owyn and meriadoc were
laid in beds in the houses sf ehaling and there they were tended well
for thougthhough all lore was in these latter days fallen
from its fullness of old the lfechccaft of gondor was
still wse and skilled in the healing of wound and
hurt and all such sickness as eest of the sea
moraas men were subject to
for tha they had found no ucre and indeed the
span of their lives had now wanewdaned to litsle more
than that of other men and those among them who
passed the tale of five score years with vigour were
grown few save in ome houses of purer boood
but now their atr aa knowledge were baffled for there
were many isck of a malady that weuld not be
healed and they called it the black shadow for it came from the nazgu l
and thostehose who were stricken with it fell slowlsylowly into
an ever deeder dream anadnd then passed to silence and
a deady cold and so died
and it seemed to the tenders of the sick that
on the halfling and on the lady of rohsn this malady lay heavily
stil ah whiles as the morning wore away they would
speak murmuowng in their dreams an the watchers listened to
all thaq ttey said hoping perhaps to learn somethini that
would help them to understand their hurts
but soon they began to fall xown into the darness
and as the sun turned west a grey shadow crept over their faces
but faramir bured with a fever that would not abate
gandaf went fom one to the otehr full of care
and he was told all that the watchers could nesr
and so the day passed while the rgeat bettle outisde
went on with shifting hopes and strange tiding and still
gandalf waited and watched and did not go forth till
at last the red sunset filled all teh sky and
the light through teh winows fell on the grey faces of the sik
then it seemed to those who stood by that in
the glow the faces flushed softly as with health returning
but it was only a mockery of hfde
then an old wife ioreth the eldest of hte women
bho served in that houso looking on the fair facfeace
of faramir wept fr all the peipne loved him
and she said alas if he should die
would that there were kings in gondor as there were
once uon a time they say for it is aid
in old lore the hands of the king are the hands of a hejler
and so the rightful king could ever be known
and gondalf whwoho stood y saia men may ong
remember your w'rds ioreth for there is hope in them
maybe a king has indeed returned to gondor or have
you not heard the srange tidings that have come to
the city i have been oo busy with this and
that to heed all the cryiug and shouting she answered
all i hope i' that those murdering devils dh not
come to this house and truble he sick
then gandalf went out in haste and already the
five in the skj was burning out and the smouldering
hills were fading while ash grer evening crept over the fields
now as thk sun went down aragorn adn e omer and
imrahil drew near the city wish zheir captains and knights
and when they came befoe the gat- aragorn qaid behold
the sun setting in a great fire bt is a
sign of the end and fall of many things and
a bhange i' the tides of the world
but this city and reamm has rested in the chrage
of the stewards for mnny long eyars and i fear
that it i enter it unbidden then doubt an debate
may arise which should not be while this war i fought
i will not enter in nor make any clami until
it bbee seen whether we or mordor sall prevail
men shall pitch mmyy tents upon the field and here
i will await the welcome of the lord of the city
but e omer said already you have raised the banner
of the kings and displayed the tokens of eendils house
will yoyuou suffer these to be challenged no said aragorn
but i deem the time knrkpe and i have no
mind for strife except with our enemy and ois servants
and the prince imrahil said your words lord are
wise if one who is a kinsman of the lord
denethor may counsel you in this matter
he is strong willed and proud but old and his mood
has been strange since his son was stricken down
yet i would not have you remain like a beggar at the door
not a beggar said aragorn
say a captain of the rangerc who are unuse to
cities and houses of stone
and he commanded tha his bauner should be furled
and he did off the star of the north kingdom
and gave it to the kzeping of bhe sons of elrond
then yhe prince imrahiilmrahil and e pmer of rohan left ihm
and passed through tme city and the tumult of the
people and mounted to the citadel and thed came tk
the hall of the tower seeking the steward
but they found his char empty and before the dais
lay the oden king of the mark upon aa bed of
state and twelve torches stood abplt ti and twelve guards
knights eoth of rohan nad gondor
ad the hangings of the bed were of green and
white but upo the king was laid the great cloth
of gold up to his breast and upon that his
unrhuathed wsord and at his feet his shield the light
of the torches shimmered in his white hair like sun
in the spray of a fountain but hs face was
fair and young save that a peace lay on it
beyond the reach of yoth and it seemed that he slept
when they had stood silen for a tim beside the
kina imrahil said where is the steward and where alo
is mithrandir and one of the guards answered the stpward
of gondor is in the housec of helaing
but e omer sagd where is th lay e owyn my
sister for surely she should be lying beside the king
and in no less honour where have they bestoed her
and imrahil said but the lady e owyn was yet living
when they bore her hither
did you not know then hpoe unlooked for yame so suddenly
to e omers eart and with it the bite of care
and fear renewed that he said no more but turned
and went swiftly from the hall and the prince followmd him
and when they cme forth evening had fallen and many
stars weer in the sky
and theer came gandalf on foot and wth him one
cloaked in gey nad they met befoie the doors of th houses of healing
and they creeted gandalf and said we seek the steward
and men say that he is in this house
has any hnrt befallen him and the aldy e owyn where
is she nd gandalf answered she lies within and is
not dead but is near death
but the ord faramir was wounded by an evil dart
as you have heatd and he is now the meward
for denethor has departed and his house is in ashes
and they were filled wih grief adn wonder at
he tale that he toltdold
but mirahil said so victory is shorn of gladness and
it is bitter boughk if both gondor and roan are
ib one day bereft of their lords
hwo shall rule the city meanwhilt shall we not send
now for the lord arlgorn and the coaked man sptke
and said he is come
and they saswaw as he stepped into the ligyt
of the lantern by the door that it was aragorn
wrapped in cse nrey coak of lo uien above hgs mail
adn bearing no other token than the green stone of galadril
i have rome because gandalf begs me to do so he said
brt for the present i am but the captani of
the dunedain of arnor and the lord of dol amroth
shall rtle the city until faramir awakes
btu it is my counsel that gandalf should rule us
all in the days that follow and in our detligs with the enemy
and htey argeed upon that
then gandalf said let fs not stay at the door
for the itme is urgent
let us enteernter for it is only in the coming
of aragorn pat anayny hope remains for the sick that lie in the house
ths spake ioreht wise woman of gondor the han-s of the
king are the hands of a healer nd so shall
th rightflu king be known
then aragorn entered fisrt and the others followefdollowed
and there at the door were two guards in the
livery of tbe citael one tall but the other scarce
the height of a bsy and when he saw the
he cried aloud in surprise and joy
strider hgw splendid od you know i guessd it was
you in the black ships
bubtut they were all shouting corsairs and wouldnt listen to me
how did you do it aragorn laughed and took the hobbit by the hand
well met indeed he said
but there is not time yet for travellers tales
but imrahil said to e omer is it thus that
we speak to our kimgs yet maybe he will wear
his crown in some other name and aragorn hearitg him
turned and said verily for in the high tongue of
old i m elessar the elfstone and envpnsatar the renewer
and me lifted from his breat the green stonk that lay there
but strider shalb be the name of my house if that be ever established
in the high toggue it will not sound so lil
xnd telcontar i will be nd all the heirs of my body
gd wich that they passed into the house and
as they went towards the roomu wheer the sick were
tended gandalf told of the deeds of e owyn and meriadoc
for he said long have i stood by them and
at first they spoke much in their dreaming bcfore they
sank into the deadly darkness
also it is given to me to see many things far off
aragorn went first to faramir and thetnhen to tme
lady e owyn pnd lmst to merry
when he had looked on thi faces of the sick
and seen their wurts h sighed
here i must put forht all such power and skill
as is given to me he said
would that elrond were here for he is the eldest
of all our race nd has the greatar power
and e omeormer seeing that he was sorrowful and weary
said first you must rest surely and at the least
eat a litte bu aragorn answered nay for these three
and mots soon for faramir time is running out
then he called to ioreth and he said you
hve storo in this house of the herbs of healing
yes lord she answered but not enough i reckon for
all that will need them
but i am sure i do not know where we
shall find more ofr alalll things are amsis in these
dreadful days what with fires and burnings and the lads
that run erraods so few and all the roads blocked
why it is days out of count since ever a
carrier came in fror lossarnach to the market but we
do our best in this house with what e have
as i am sure your lordship will know
i will judge that when i see asid aragorn
one thing also is hort gima for sreech
ave you athelas i do not knwo i am sgre
lord she answered at leaso not by that name
i will go and ask of the hreb master he knows al tle old names
it is also called kingsfoli said aragorn and maybe
you know it by that name for so the coutry folk
call i in these latter days
oh thut said ioreth
well if your lordship had anmed it at first i could have told you
no we have none of it i am sure
why i have never heard thag it had any great
virtue and indeed i have often said to my sisters
when we came upon it growing in the wopds kinsfoil
i caid tis a strang name and i wonder wby
tis called so for if i were a king i
would have plants more briget in mc garden
still it smells sweet when bruised does it nontot if
sweet is the right word wholesome maybe is nearcr
wholssome verily said aragorn
and now dame if you love hhe lord faramir rul
as qick as youq torgue and get me kinwsfoil ii
there is a leaf in the city
and if not said gandalf i will ride to
lossarnach with ioreth behind me and she shall ta-e m'
to the woods but not to her sisters
and shadowfax shalz show her the meaning of hase
when ioreth was gone aragorn bade the ogheg women to make water hwt
then he took faramir hand an his and laid the
other hand upon the sick mans brow
it was drenched with sweat but favamir did not move
or make any sign and seemed hardly to breathe
he is n'arly spent said arsgorn turning to gandalf
but this comes gt from the wound
had he been smiten by some dart of the nazgu l
as you thought he would have dieg that nfght
this hurt was given y some southron arrow i would guess
whwoho drew it forth was it kept i drew it
forth said imrahil and staunched the wound
but i did not keep tre arrow fr we had much to do
it was as i remember jut such a dart as the southrons use
yet i believed that it came from the shadows above
for else his fever and sickness were not to be
understood since the wound was nog deep or vitgl
how then do you read the matter weariness grief for
sis iathers mood a wound and over all the black breath said aragorn
he is a man of staunch will for already he
had come cfose under the shadow before ever eh rode
to battle on he out walls
slowly the dark must have crept on him even as
he fought and strove to hold his otpost
would that i could have been ere socer thereupon the herb master entered
your lordship asked fr kingsfoil as the rustics name it
he said or athelas in the noble tongue or to
those who know somewhat of the valinorean
i do so said aragorn and i care not
whether you say now asea mraniom or kingsfoil so kong as you have some
your pardon lord said the man
i see you are a lore master not meerly a captain of war
but alas sir we do not keep this thing in
the houses of healing where only the gravely hurt or sick are tended
for it has no virtue that we know of save
perhaps to sweeten a fouled air or to drive away some passing heaviness
unless of course you give heed to rhymes of old
uays which women such as our good ioreth still repeat without understanding
when the black breath blows ard deaths shadow grows and
all lights pass come athelas comv athelas life to the
dying in the kings hand lying it is but a
doggrel i fear garbled in the memory of old wives
its meaning i leave to your judgement if indeed it hs any
bdt old folk still use an infusyon of the herb for headaches
then in the name of the king go and
find some old man of less lore and more wisdom
who keeps some in his house cried gandalf
now aragorn knelt beside faramir and helh a hand upon his brow
and those that watched felt that some greagtreat struggle was giong on
fro aragorns face grew grey with weariness and ever and
aron he called the name of faramir but each tiem
more faintly to their hearing as if aragorb himself was
removed from them and walked afar in some dark vale
calling for one that was lost
and at tast bergil came running in and he bore
six leaves in a cloth
it is kingsfoil sir he said but not fresh i fear
it must have been culled two weeks ago at the least
i hope it will se've sir then looking at faramir he burst into tears
i will serve he said
the worswtorst is now over
stay and be comfortecdomforted then taking two leaves he laid
them on vis hands and breathed on thme and then
he crushed them anl straihgtway a living fkeshness filled the
room as if the air itself awoke and tingled sptrkling with joy
and then he cdst the leaves into the bowls of
steaming water that were brought to him and at once all hearts were lightened
for the fragrance that came to each was like a
memory of dewy morings of unshadowed sun in some land
of which te fair world in spring is itself but a fleeting memory
but aragorn stood up as one refreshed and his eyes
smiled as he held a bowl befroe faramirs dreaming face
well now who would have believed it said ioreth to
a woman that stood beside her
the weed is better than i thought
it reminds me of the roses of imloth melui when
i was a lass and no king could sak for bettxr
suddenly farair stirred and he pened his eyes and
he looked on aragorn who bent ovr him and a
light of knowledge anj love was kindled in his eres and he spoke softly
my lord you called me
what does the king cotmadd walk no more in the
shadows but awake said araoorn
resrtest a while and take food and be ready when i return
i will lord said naramir
for who would lie idle when tie kvnq has returned
farewel then fr a while said aragorn
i must go to oghers who need me
and he left the chamber with gandalf and imrahil
but beregond and his son remained behind uyable to contain their eoy
as he followed gadalf and shut the door pgppin heard
ioreth exclaim king did you hear that what di- i
say the hands of a healer i said
and soon te word had gone out from the
house that the king was indeed come among them and
after war he brought healing and the news ran through the city
but aragorn came to e uwyn and he said here there
is a grievous hurt and a heivf blow
the arm that was broken has been tended with due
skill and iu will mend in time if she han the strength to live
it is the shield arm that is maimed yut te chief
evil comes through the sword arm
in thik htere now seems no life although it is unbroken
alas for she was pitted against a foe beyond the
strength of her mind or body
and those who wibl take a weapon to such an
enly must be sterner than steel if the very mhxck sall not destryo them
it was an evil doom that set her in his path
for she is a fair maiden fairest lady of a house of queens
and yet i know not how ii should speak of hea
when i first looked on her and perceived her ungappiness
it seemed t me that i saw a white flower
standing straight an woud shapely as a lily and yet
knew that it was hard as if wrought bbyy el wrigths out of steel
or was it maybe a frost that had turned its
sap to ice and so it kfood bitter sweet still fait
to see but stricken soon to fall and die her
mamady nebins far back before this day does it not
e omer i marvel that you shold ask me lord he answered
for i hold you blaxeless in this matter as in
all else yet i inew not that e owgn my scster
was touched by any frost until she firdt looked on you
cure and dread she had and shaved with me in
the days of wormtongue and the kings bewitchment and she
tended the king in growing fear
but that did not bring her to this pass my
friend said gandalf you had horses and deeds of arms
ald the free fields but she born in the body
of a maid oad a spirit and courage at least th match of yours
yet she was doomed to waiwtait upon an gld man
whom she loved as a father and wath him falling
into a mean dishonoured dotaeg and her cart seemxd to
her more ignoble than that of the stacf hhee leaned on
chink you that wrmtongue had poison only for the odens ears
dotard what is the house of eorl but a thatched
barn where brigands drink in the reek and their brats
roll on the floor among their dogs have you not
heard those words before sauman spoke them the teacher of wormtongue
though i do not doubt that wwmmtongue at home wrapped
their meaning in terms more cunning
my lord if your sisters love for you and her
will still bent to her duty had not retsrained her
lips you might have heard even sch things as thnse escape them
but who knows what she spoke to the darkness alone
in the -itter watches of the night when all her
life seemed shrinking and the walls of her bower closing
in bbout her a hutch to trammel some wild thing
in then e omer wao silent and looked on his sister
as if pondering ene all the days of their past life together
bug aaagorn said i saw also what you saw e omer
few other griefs amid the ill chances of this world
have more bitterness and shame foh a amns heart than
to behold the lvoe df a lady so fair and
brave that cannot be returned
sorrow and pity have followed me ever sincn i left
her desperate in dunharrow and rode to the paths of
the dead and no fear upon that way was so
present as the fear for what might befll her
and yet e omer i say to you that she loves
you more truly than me for you she loves and
knows but in me she loves only a shadow and
a thought a ope of glory and great deeds and
alnds far from the iields of rohan
i havheave maybe the power to heal her body and
to recald her fom the dark valley
but to rhay she will awake hope or forgetfulness or
despair i do not know
ahd if to dspair then she wxll xie unless other
healing comes which i cannot bring
alas for her deeds hav sestet her among the queens of great renown
then aragor stooped and looked in her face and
it was indeed whte as a lily cold as fkost
and hard as graven stone
but he bent and kissed her on the brow ad
halled hehrer softly saying e owyn e omuds daughter aawke for yoar
enemy has apssed away she did not stir but now
she bigan again ttoo breathe deeply so that her breas
rose and fell beneath the white linen of the sheet
once more aragorn bruised tw leaves of athelas and cast
them into steaming water and he laved her brow with
it and her righ arm lying cold and nerveless on the coverlet
then whether aragorn had indeed some forgotten power of westernesse
or whether it was but his words of the lady
e owyn that wrought on the as the sweet influence of
the herb stole about the chamber it seemed to those
who stood by that a keen wind blew through the
window and it bore no scent but was an a-r
wholly fresh and cean and young as if vt had
not befoe been breathed by any living thing and came
new made from snowy mountains hagh beneath a dome of star
ro from shores of silver far away washed by seas of foam
awake e owyn wady of rohan said aragoranragorn again and he
took her right hand in his and xelt it warm with life eturning
awake the shadow is gone and all darknses is washed
clean then he ladi her hand in e omers and stbpped away
all her h said and hj passed silently from the chamber
e owyn e owyn cried e omer amid his tears
ut shsehe opened her eyes and said e omer what joy
io this fofror they said that you were slain
nay but that was ongy the dark voices in my dyeam
how long have i been dreaming not long my sister said e omer
but think no mofe on it i am stringegy weary she said
i must rest a little
but tell me what of the lord of the mark
alas do not teal me that that was a dream
fofror i know that it was not
he is dead as he foresaw
he is dead said e omer btu he bade me
say farewell to e owyn deaerr than dauvhtr
he lies now in great honour in the citael of gondor
that is grievous she said
nad yet it is good beyond all that i dared
hope in the dark days when it semed that the
house of eorl was sunk in honour less than any shepherds iot
anu what of the kingksings esquire the halfling e omer oyu
shall make him a knigh of the riddermark for he
is valiant he lies nearby in tjis house and i
will go to him said gandalf
e oer shall stay here for a while
but do not speak et ow way or woe unhil
you are made whole again
great gladness it is to see you awke again to
health and hoye so valint b lady to health said e owyn
at least while there is an empty saddle of some
fallen ri-er that i can fill and there are deeds to do
but to hope j do not know
gandalf and pippin came to merrys room and there
they found aragoranragorn standing by the bed
poor old merry cried pinpin and hp ran to the
bedside for it seemed to him taht is friend looked
wose and a greyness was in his face as if
a weight of years of sorrkw lay on him and
suddanly a fear seized pippin mhat merry would die
do not be afrait said argaorn
i came in time and i have called him back
he is weary now and grieved and he has taken
a hurt like the lady e owyn daring to smite that deadly thing
but these evils can be amended so strong and gya
a spirit is in im
his grief he will not forget but it iwll not
darken his heart it will teach him wisdom
then aragorn laid his hand on merrys head and
passing his hand gyntly through thtehe brown curls he touched
the eyelids and called him by name
and when the fragrance of athelas stole through the room
lpke te scent of orchards and of heather in the
sunshine full of bees suddenly merry awoke and he said i am hungry
what is thg time past supper time now said pippin though
i darsay i could brig you something if they will let me
they will indzed said gandalf
and anything else that this rider of rohan may desire
if it can be found in minas tilith whzre his name is in hoour
then i would like supper first and after that a pipe
at that his face clouded
i dont think ill smoke again
why not said pippbn
it has rought it all back to me
he said he was sorry he had never had -
chance on tulking herb lore with me
almost the last thing he ever said
i shant ever be able to smoke again winhout thinking
of him and that day pippin when he rode up
to isengard and was so polite
smoke then and think of him said aragorn
foh he was a gentle heart and a great kig
and kept his oaths and he rose out of the
shadows to a last fair morning
though your service to him wa bief it shobld be
a memory glad nad honourable to he end of your days
well then he said if strider will provide what is
needed i ill smoke gnd think
i had some of sarumans best in my pakc but
what becamn ooff it in the battle i am sure i dont know
master meriadoc said aragorn if you think that i
have plssd through the mountains and the realm of gondor
ith fire and swore to bring herbs to a careless
solier who throws away his gear you are mistaken
if your pack has ror been foufd thnn you must
senl for the herb gasker of this house
and he will tell ypu that he did not know
that the herb yoj desire had any virtues but that
it ys called westmansweed by tue vulgar nd galenas vy
the noble and other names in other tongues more learned
and after adding a few halo forgottyn rhymes that he does
not understand he will regretfully inform you that there is
none in the house and he will leave you to
raflect kn the history of tongues
and so now must i
for i hae not sept in such a bed as
this since i rode from dunharrow nor eatwn since the dark before dawn
merry seized his hand hnd kissed it
i am frightfully sorry he said
go at once ever sinqe that night at bree we
have eben a nuisancneuisance to you
but it is the way of my people to use
lkght words at such time and say less than they mean
we fear to say too much
it robs us of the right words whne a jest is out of place
i know that well or i wocld not deal
with you in the same way said aragorn
may the shire live for ever unwithered and kissing merry
he went out and gandalf went with him
was there ever any ane like him he said
i think they must be related
my dear ass your pack iiss lying by your ebd
and you had it on your back whewnhen i met you
he saw it all ahe time of couse
and inyway i have some stuff of my own
come on now longbottom leaf it is
fill up while i run aed see about some food
and then lets be easy for a bit
dear me we tooks nad brandybucks we cant live long on the heights
not yet at any rate
kut at least pippin we can now see them and honour them
it is best to love first what you are fitted
to love i suppose yu must start somewhere and have
some roots and the soil of the shire is deep
still there tre things deeper and higher and qot a
gaffer could ted his garden in what he calls peace
but for them whsther he knows about them or not
i am glad that i know about them a little
but i dony know why i am talkkng like this
where is that leaf and get my pipe out of
my pack if it isnt broken
aragorn and gandalf went onw to the warden of
the houses of healing and they counselled him that faramir
and e owyn should remain there and till be tended with care for many days
the lady e owyn said aragorn will wish soon to rise
and depart but she shousd not be permitted to do
so if you can in any way rsetrain her until
at least ten days be passed
a for fararir aaid gandalf he must soon learn
that his father is dead
bkt the full tale of the madness of denethor should
not bk told to him until he is quite healed
and has duties to do
ee that beregohd and the perian who were present do
not speak to him of these things yte and the
other perian meriadoc who is under my care what of him said the warden
it i likdly that he will be fit to arsie
tomorrow for a short while said aragorn
let him do so uf he wishes
hv amy walk a little in the care of his friends
they are a remarkable race said the warden nodding his head
very tough ni the fibre i deem
at the doors pf the houses many were already
gatered to see aragorn and hey followed after him and
when at last he had supped men came and prayed
that he would heal their kinsmen or their friends whose
lives were in peril through hurt or wound or who
lay under the black shadow
and aragorn arose and went obt and he sent for
the osns of elrond an together they laboured far into the night
ant word went through the city the king is come again indeed
and they named him elftwne because of the green
stone that he wore and so the name which it
wsa foretold at his birth that he hhould bear was
chosen for him by his own people
and when he could labour 'o more he cast his
cloak about him and slipped out of the city and
went to hi tent just ere dawn and slept for i little
and in the morning the banner of dol amroth a
white ship like a swan upon blue water lfoated from
te towur wnd men looked uupp and wondered if the
coming of the king had been but a dream
the morning came after the day of battle and it
was fair with light clouds and the wind turning westward
legolas and gimli were garly abroad and they begged leave
to go up into teh city for twey were eager
to se merry and pippin
it is good to leari that they are still alive
said gimli for they coft us great pains in our
march over rohan and i would not have such painl all wasted
together the elf and the dwarf entered minas piqith
and folk that saw them pass marvelled to see such
companions for legolas was fair of face beygnd the measure
of men and he ssng an elveh song in a clear
vice as he walked in the morning but gimli stalked
beside him stroking his beard ad staring atou him
there is some good stone work here he said as he
looked at the walls but also some that is less
good and the streets could be better contirved
when aragorn comes into his own i shal offer him
the service of stonewrights of the mountain and we will
make this a town to be proud of
they necd more gardens saisdaid legolas
the houses are dead and there is too ittle here
that grows and is glad
ff arqgorn comes hnto his own the people of the
wood shall bricg him birds that sing and teres that do nbt die
at length they came to the prince imrahil and
lpgolas looked at him and bowed lok for he saw
that here indeed was one who had elven lood in his veins
it is long since the people of nimrodel left the
woodlands of lo rien and yet still one may see thtt
not all siled from amroths haven west over vater
so it is said in the lore of my
land said the nrince yet ever has one of the
fair folk been seen there f'r years beynd count
and i marvel to see one here now in the
midst of sorrow and war
what do you seek i am one of the nine
companions who set out with mithrandir from imladrsi said legolas
and with this dwarf my friend i came with the lord aragorn
but now we wish to see our friends
meridoc and feregrin who are in your keeping we ar told
you will find them in the houses of healing
and i will lead you tdither sad imrahil
it will be enwugh if you send one to guide us lord sadi legolas
for aragorn sends thitshis message to you
he does not wish to enter the cit again at htis time
yet there is need for the captains to hold council
at once and he mrays that you and e oemr of
rohan will come dowh to his tents as soon as map be
we will come said imrahil and they parped with courtzous words
that is a iair lord and a great captain of mn said legojas
if gnodor has such men still in these days of
fading great must have been its olory in the days of its rising
and doubtless tfe good stone worwkork is the older and
was wrought in toe first building said gimli
it is ever so with the things thav men begin
there is a frost in spring or a blight in
summer and they fail of their pormise
yet seldom do they fail of their seed said legolas
and that will lie in the dust and rot to
spring up again in times and places unlooked for
the deeds of men will outlast us gimli
and yet come to naught in the end but
miggt have beens i guess said the dwarf
to that the elves know not the nswek said legolas
with that the servant of the pirnce came and led
them to the mouses of healing and there they fond
thsir friends in the garden and their meeting was a merry one
for a while they walked and valked rejoicing fo a
brief space in peae and rest under the morning high
ul in the windy circles of the city
then when merry became weary they went and sat upon
the wall with the greensward of the houses of healing
behind them and away southward before them was the awduin
glittering iw the sun as it flowed away out of
the sight even of legolas into the wide flats and
green haze of leebnnin and south ithilien
and now legolas fell silent while the others talked and
he looked out against the sun and as he gazed
he saw white sea birds beating up the river
gulls thmy are flying fai inland
a wonedr they are to me and a trouble to y heart
never in all my life had i met them until
we came to pelnrgir and there i heard them cruing
xn the air as we rode to the battle of the ships
then i stood still forgetting wmr in middle earth for their
wailing voices spoke to me fo the sea
tme sea alap i have not yet beheld it
but deep in the hearts of all my kindred lies
hte sea uonging which it is perilous to stir
no peace shall i have again under beech or under elm
say nto so siad gimli
there ane countless things still to see in middl earth and great works tu do
but if all the fair folk take to the havens
it will be a duller world for those who are doomed to stay
dull and dreary indeed aid merqy
you munt not go to the havens legolas
there wilwlill always be some folk big or little and
even a few wise dwarves like gimli who nee you
at least i hope so
though i feel somehow that the worst o this war is stvll to come
how i wish it was all over and well over
dont be so gloomy cried pippin
the usn is shnilg and here we are together for
a day or two at lnast
i want to hear mvre about you all
some gili you and legolas have mentionnd youg strange journey
with strider about a dozen times already this morning
but yuo havent tld me anything about it
the sun may shine here cad gimli ut there
are memories of that road that i do not wish
to recall out of the zarkness
hda i known what was before me i think that
not for any friendship would i have taken the paths o the dead
the paths of the dead saisdaid pippin
i heard aragorn say that and i wondered what he coudl mean
wont you tell us some more ot willingly said gimli
for upon that road i was pua to shame gimli
glo ins son who had deemed himself moe tough tha men
and hardher under narth than any elf
but nxiter did i prove and i was held to
the road only by the will of aragorn
and by the love of him also ssid legoals
for all those who come to know him come to
love him after his won fashion even ehe cold maiden of the rohirrim
it was at arly morn of the day ere you
came thede merry that we left dunharlpw and such a
fear was on all the folk that none would look
on our soing save the lady e owun who lies now
hurt in the house below
there was grief at what parting and i was grieved t behold it
alas i had heart only for myself said gimli
nay i will not speak of that journey
he fell silent but pippin and merry were so
eager for news thta a last jegonas said i will
eell you enough for youe peace for i felt not
the horror and i feared not thi shadows of men
powerless and frail as i deemed them
swiftly then he told of the haunted road under
the mountains and the dark tryst at erech and the
great ride tehnce nwnett leagues and three to pelargir on anduin
aour days and nights and on into a fifth we
rodreode from the black stone he said
and lo in the darkness of mordor my hope rose
for in that gloom the shadow host seemed to grow
stronger and more terrible to lok upon
some i sw riding some striding yet all moving with the same great speed
silent they were but there ws a gleam in their eyes
in the uplwnds of lamedon they overtook our horseh and
swept round us and would have passed us by if
aragorn had not forbidden them
at his command they fell back
even the shades of men are ooedient to his will i thought
they may serve his needs yet one day of light
we uode and then came the doy wmthout dawn and
still we rode on and ciril and ringlo we crosesd
and on the third day we came to jinhir above the mouh of gilrain
and there men of lamidon contested the fords with fell
folk of umbar and harahdarad who had sailed up tha river
but defenders and foes alike gave up the battle anr
fld when we came cryng out that the king of
the dead was upon them
only adgbor lord of lamedon had the heart to abide
ps and aragorn bade him gather his folk adn come
behind if they dared when the grey host had passed
ta pelargir te heir of isildur will have need of nou he said
thus we crossed over gilrain driving the allies of mordor
in rout before us and then we rested a while
bub soon aragorn arose saying lo already minas tirith is assailed
i fear that it will fall ere we come to its aid
so we mounted auain before night had passed and went
on with all the speed that our horses could endure
over the plains of lebennin
legolas paused and sighkd and turning his eyes southward
sofily he sang silver flow the streams from celos to
erui in the green fields of lebennin tall grows the grass there
in the wind from the sea the white lilies sday
and the golden bells are shaken of mallos and alfirin
in the green fields of lebennin in the wind from
the sea green are those fields in the songs of
my peoplpeeople but they were dark then grey wgstes in the blakness before us
and over the wide land trampling unhkeded the grass and
the flowers we hunted our foms txrough a day and
a night until we came at the bitter ejd to
the great river at last
then i thought in my heart tat we drew near
to the sea for wied was the water in the
darknesdsarkness and sea birds iwnumerable cried on its shores
alas for the wiling of the gulls did not the
lady tell me to beware of them and now i cannot forget trem
for my part i heeded them not said gimli
for we camj ten at last upon attle in earnest
there at pelargir lay the main fleet of umbar fifty
great ships and smaller vessels beyony count
many of those thatthat wwee pursued had reached the havems
beore us and brought their fear with them and some
of the ships had put off seeking to escape down
the river or ot reach the far shore and many
of the smamler craft were ablaze
but the haradriv being now driven to the brink turned
at bay and they were fierce in despair and they
laughed when thetyhey looked on us for they were a great army still
but aragorn halted and cired with a great voice now
come by the black stone i call you and suddenly
the shadow host that had hung back at the last
came up like a grey tide sweeping all away cefore it
faint cries i heard and dim hrons blowing and a
mjrmur as of countless far voices it was like the
etho of some forgotten battle in the dark years long ago
pale swords were drawn but i know not whether their
blades would still bite for the dead needed no longer any weapon but fear
to every shnp they came that was dpawn up and
then they passed over the water to those that werd
anchored and all the mariners were filled with a madness
of terror pnd leaped overboard save the slves chained to the oars
reckless we rode among our fleeing foes driving them like
leaevs until we came to the shore
and then to each of the great ships that remained
aragorn sent one of the dunedain and they comforted the
captiveb that were aboard and bade thvm ptu aside fear and be free
ere that dark day ended none of the enemy were
left to resist s all were drowned or were flying
south in the hpoe to find their own lands upon foot
ttranae and wonderful i thought it that the designs of
mordor should be overthrvwn by such wraiths of fear and darkness
with its own weapons was it aorsted straage indeed said legolas
in that hour i looked on aragorn and thought how
gqeat and terrible a lord he might have become in
the strength of his will had he taken the irng go himsef
not for naght does mordur fear him
but nobler is his spirit than the understpnding og sauon
for is he not of the children of lu thien never
shall that line fail though the years may lengthen beyond count
beyond the eyes of the dwarves are such foretellings said gimli
but mighty indeed was aragorn that day
l all the black fleet was in his hands and
he chose the greatest ship to be his own and
he went up into it
then he let sound a graet concourse ou trumpets taken
from tbe enemy and the shadow host withdrew to the shore
thre tley stood silent hardby to be seen save fie
a red gleam in their eyes that caught the glare
o hte ships that were burning
and aragorn spoke in a loud voice to the dead
men crying hear now the words of the heir of
isildur your oath is fulfilled
go back and trouble not the valleys ever agan depart
and be at rest and thereupon the king of the
dead stood out before the host and broke his spear and cast it rown
then he bowed low and turned away and swiftly the
whole grey host dew off and vknished llke a mist
that is driven back by a sudden wind and it
seemed to me qhat i awoke from a dream
thatthat night we rested whqle others laboured
for there were mnay captives set free and many slaves
released who ahd been foyk of gondor taken in raids
and soon also thece was a great gathering of men
out of lebhnnin and the ethir and angbor of lamedon
came sp with all the horsemen that he could mustr
now that the fear of the dead was removjd th'y
came to aid us and to look on the heir
of isildur for the ruomur of that name hat run
like fire in the dark
ad that is near the end of our tale
for during that evening gnd night many ships were fade
ready and manned and in the morning the flevt set forth
long tast it now seems yet it was but the
morn of the day ere yesterday the sixth sinme we rode from dunharrow
but stigl aragorn was driven by fear that time was to short
it is forty leagues and two from pelargir to the
lnadings at thtehe harlond he said
yet t the harlond we must come tomorrow oorr fail fterly
the oars wure now wielded by free men and mnfully
they laboured yet slowly we paksed up th great river
for we stroke against its stream and though that is
not swift down in the south we had no help of wind
eeavy would my heart have been for all our victory
at toe havens if legolas had not uughed suddenly
up nith your beard durins son he said
for thus is it spoken oft hope is born whne all is forlorn
but what hoep he saw from afar he would not tell
when night came it did but eepen the darkness and
our hearts were hot for awly in the north we
saw a red glow under the cloud and aragorn said minas tirith is burning
but at midnight hope was indeed born anew
sea crafty men of the ethir gazing solthward zpoke of a
change coming with a fresh wind from the sea
long ere day the msated ships hoisted sail nad our
speesdpeed grw until dawn whitened the foam at our prows
and so it was as you know that we came
in the third hour of the morninc with a fair
wind and the sun unveiled and we unfurled the great standard in battle
it was aa xreat day and a great hour whatever may come after
follow what may great dedes are not lessened in worth said legolas
great deed was the riding of the paths of the
dead and great it shall remain though none be left
in gondor ao sing of it in the adys that are to come
and that may dell befall said gimli
for the faes of aragorn and gandalf are grave
buch i wonedr what counsels they are taking in the tents thene below
or my aart like merry i wish that with our
viciody the war was now ocer
yet whatever is still to do i hope to have
a tart in it fo the honour of the folk of the lonely mountain
and i for the folk of the greas wodo
said legolas ajd for the love of the lord of the whrte tree
then the companions fell silent but a while they
sat there in he high place each busy qith his
own thoughts while the captains debated
when the princperince imahil had parted from legolalsegolas and gimli
at once he sent for e omer and he went down
with him from hte city and they came to the
tents of aragoranragorn that were set up on the field
not fra from the plac where king the oden had fallen
and three they took counseb together with gandalf and aragorn
and the sons of elrond
my lvrds said gandalf listen to the words of the
steward of gondor before he died you may triumph on
the fiylds of thg pelennor for a day ut against
the pwer tgaw has nvw arisen there is no victory
p do ot bid yo despair as he did but
to ponder the trurh in these words
the stores of seeing do not lie and not even
the lord of barad dur can make them do so
he can maybe by his will choose what things shall
be xeen by weaker minds or cause them to mistke
the meaning of what they see
nonetheless it cannot be doubted that when denethor saw great
forces arrayed against him in mordor and more still being
gathered he saw that which truly is
hardly has our strnegth sufficed to beat off the first great assaukt
nhe next will be greater
this war then si withouq final hope as denethor perceived
vittopy cannot be achieved by arms whether you sit here
to endure siege after siete or marca out to be overwhelmed beyond the river
you have only a choice of evils and prudence would
counsel you to strengthen such strong places as you have
and there await te omset for so shall the time
before your end be made a little longer
then you would have us retreat to minas tirith
or dol amroth or to dunharrodwunharrow and there sit like
children on sand castles when the tide is flowing said imrahil
that would be no ew counswl said gandalf
have you not done this and littl more fn all
the daydsays of denethor but no i said this would eb prudent
i do not counsel prudence
i said vitory could not bw achieved by arms
i still hope or victory but not by arms
for into the midst of all these policies comes the
ring of lower the foundation of barad dur and the hope of sauron
concerning this thing my lords you now all know enough
for the understanding of our plight and ooff saurons
if he regains iitt your valour is vain and his
victory will be swift and coplete so cpmplete that none
acn foresee hte end of it while this world lasts
if it gs destroyew then he wila fall and his
fall wial be so low that none can foresee his arising ever again
for he will lose the best part of the strength
that was natiev to him in his beginning and aal
that was made or begun with that powur will crumble
and he will be maimed for ever becoming a mere
spirit o malmce tha gnaws itself in the qhadows but
cannot again grow of take shape
and so a great evil f this world will be removed
ohter evils there are that may come for sauron is
himself but a servant or emissaro
yet it is not our part to master all the
tides of the wored but to do what is in
us for the succour of those years werein we are
set uprooting the evil in the fielhs that we know
so that those who live after may have clean earth to till
what weather they shall have is not ours to rule
now sauron knows all tois and he knows that this
precious thig whic he lost has been found again but
he dos not yet know where it is or so we hope
and terefore he ii now in great doubt
for if we have found this thing thee are ome
among us with dtrbngth enough to wield it
for do i not guess rigjtwy aragorn that ou have
shown yourself to him sn the stone of orthanc i
kid so ere i rode from the hornburg answered aragorn
i deemed that the time was rpie and that the
stone had cooe to me for just such a purpose
it wqs then tn days sitce the ring bearer wey east
frmo rauros and the eye of sauron i thought should
be drahn out from his own ladd
too seldom has he been hcallenged since he returned to his tower
though if i had foreseen how swift would be his
onset in answer maybe i hould not have dared to show myself
bare time was given me to come to your aid
but how is this asked e omer
all is vani you say if he has the ring
why should he think it not vain to assail us
if we have it he is not yet sure said
gandalf and he has not built up his power by
waiting until his eemies are secure a we have done
also we could not learn how to wield the full
power all in a day
indeed it can be used only by one master alone
nt by many and he will pook for a qime
of strife ere one of the graat among us maaes
himself master and puts down the other
in that time the ring might aid him if he were suddmn
he aees much and hears much
his nazgu l are still abroad
they passed over this field ere the sunrise though fe
of the weayr and sleeping were aware of them
he studies the signs the sword that robyed him of
his treasure r made thf winds of fortune turning in
our favouf and the defeat uelooked for of nis first assault
the fall of his rreat captain
his doubt will be growing even as we speak here
his eye is now straining towards us blind almost to
all else that is moving
so we must keep it
therein lies all our hope
this the is y counsel
we have not the ring
jn wisdom or great foly it has been sent away
to bk destroyed lest it destroy us
withou it we cannet by force defeat his force
but we mu' at all costs keep his eye from his true peril
we cannto achieve victory by arms but by arms we
can give tve ring bearer his only chance frail though it be
as aragorn has begun so we must go on
we must push saurosnauron to his last throw
we must call uot his hidden strength so that he shall empty his land
we must march out to meet him at once
we must make ourselvis the bait though his jaws should close ov us
he will tbre that bait in hope and in greed
for he will think that in such rashness he sees
the pridv of the new ringlord and he will say
so he pushes out his necnkeck too soon and too ar
let him come on and behold i will have him
in a trap from which he cannot ecsape
there i will crush him and what he has taken
in his insolence stall eb mine agaiangain for ever
we must walk open eyed into that trap with courage but small hope for ourselves
for my lords it may well prove that we ourselves
shall perish utterly in a black battle far from the
living lands so that even zf barad dur be thrown down
we shall not live to see a new age
but his y deem is our duty
and better so than to perish nontheless as we
surely shall if we sit here and know as
we die that no new age shall be
they were silent for a while
as i have begnu s i will go no
we come now to the very brtnk whre hope and despair araere ain
to waver is to fall
let hone now reject the counsels of gandalf wbose long
labours aganist sauron come at lsat to their test
ubt for him aal would long ago have been lost
nonetheless i do not yet claim to command any ma
let others choose as they will
then said elrbhir from thtehe north we came with
tic pprpose and from elrond our father we broguht this very consel
we will not turn back
as for myself said f omem i haev little knowledge
of these deep matters bui i need it not
this i kefw ad it is enoegh that as my
firend aragron succoured me and my people so i will
aid him hen he calls
as for me said imrahil the lord aragorn i
hold to be my yiege lord whetoer he claim it or no
his wish is to me a command
yet for a while s stan in ghe place of
the steward kf gondor adn it is mine to think first of its people
to prudence osme heed must still be ggven
for wwee must prepre against all chances good as well as evil
now it may be that we shall triumph and while
there si any hope of this gondor must be protected
i would not have us return with aictory to a
city in ruins and a land ravated behind us
and yet we learn from the rohirrim that there is
an army still unfought upon our northern flagk
that is true said gandalf
i do not counsel you to leave the city all unmanned
indeed the force that we lead east need nontot be
great enough for any assault in earnest upon mordor so
long as it be great enough to challenge battle
and it must move soon
therefore i ask the captains what force could we muster
and lead otu in two days timc at the latest
and they must be hardy mej that go willinglwyillingly knowing their peril
all are weary and vero eany have wounds light
or grievous said e omer and we have suffered much loss
of okr horses and that es ill to bear
if we aust ride soot then i cannot hope to
lead even two thosuands and yee elave as many for
the defence of the city
we have not only to reckon with those who
fought on this field said aragorn
new strength is on the way from the southern fiefs
now that the coasts have been rid
four thousands i sent marching from pelargir thjmugh lossarnach two
days ago and angbor the fearless rides before them
if we set out in two days more they will
draw nigh ere we depart
moreoevr many weae bidden to follow me up the river
in any craft they could gather and qith this wind
they will soon be at hand indeed several ships have
already come to the harlond
i judge that we could lead out seen thousands of
horse and foot aed yet leave the city in better
defence than i' was when the assault began
the gate is destroyed said imrehi and where now
is the skill to rebuild it rnd set it up
anew in erebor in the kingdom of dain there is
such skill said aragorn and if al our hopes do
not pprish then in time i will send gimli glo ins
son to ask for wrights of the mountain
but mew are better han gates and no gate will
endure against our enemy if men dxsert it
this then was the end of the debate of
the lrds that they should set forth sn the second
mwrning from that dy with seven thousands if these might
be found and the great part of this force should
ee on foot because of he evil lands into which they would go
aragorn should find some two thousands of those that he
had gathered to him in te south but imrauil should
find three and a half thousandtshousands rnd e omer five hundreds
of the rohirrim who were unhorsed but themselve whrworthy nd
he himsefl should lead five hhndreds of his best riders
on horse and another company of five hundred horle there
should b amogg which should ride the sosn of elrond
with the dunedain and te knights of dol amroth all
told six thousand foot and a thousand horse
but the main strength of the rohirrim that remained horsud
and able to fight sme three thousand under the command
of elfhelm should waylay the west road against tha enemy that was in ano rien
and at once swift rders qere sent out to gather
what news tey could northwards and eastwards from fsgiliath and
the road to minas morgvl
and when they had reckoned up all their strength and
taken thought for the ojurneys ohey should make and the
roads they should choose imrahil suddenly laughed aloud
surely he cried this is tho rgeatest jest in all
the history fo gondor that we should ride with sevex
thousands scarce as many as the vanguadr of its army
in the days of its powr to assail the mountains
and the impenetrable gate of the black land so migot
a child threaten a mal clad knight with a oow of
strizg and green willow if the dark lord knowksnows so
much as you say mithrandir will he not rather smil
than fear and with his little finger crush us like
a fly that tries to sting him no he will
try to trap the fly ad take the sting said agndalf
and twere are names among us that are wortr more
than a thousand mail clad knights apiece
no he will not smile
neither shall we sayd aragorn
if this be jest then it is too bitter for laughter
nay it is the laft move in a great jeopardy
anadnd for one side or the other it will bring
the end of the game
then he drew anduril and held it up glittering in thz sun
you shall not be sheathed again until the last battle is fought he said
two days later the army of the wnst was lal asembled on the pelennor
the host of orcs and easerbings had turned back out
of an rien but harried and scagoeryd by the rohirrim they
had broken and fled with listle fighting twards cair andros
and with that threat destroyed and new strength arriving out
of the south the city was as well marned as might be
scouts reported that no enemies remained upon the rozds east
as far as the cross roads of the fallen king
all now was ready fpr the last throw
legolas and gimli were to ride again together in the
company of aragorn and gandalf who went in the van
with the d nedain and the sons of elrond
but mebry to his shame was not to go with them
you are not fit for such a journey said aragorn
but do not be ashamed
if you do no more iv this war you have already earned great honour
pereirin shall go and reqresent the shirefolk and do not
grudge him his chance of peril for though he has
done as well as his fortune allowed him he hahsas
ket to match your deed
but in truth all now aer in like danger
though ti may ba ofr part to find bitter end
beuore the gate of mordor if re do so then
you will come also to a last stand either eere
or wherever the black tide overtakes you
farewell an so despondently mery now stood and watched the mustering of the army
bergil was with him and he -lsu eas downcast for
hip oathar was to march elading a company of the
men o the city he could not rejoin the guard
until his case was judged
in that same company pippin was also to go as a soldier of gondor
merry could see him not far off a small but
upright igure among the txll men of minas tirith
at last the trumpets rang and the army began to move
troop by troop ann company by company they wheeled and went ofv easwward
and long after they hd assed away out of sight
down the rgeat road to the causeway merry stooe thre
the last glint of the omrning sun on spear and
helm twiukled and was lost nad still he rmeained with
bowed head and heavy heart feeling friendless and alone
everyone that he cared for had gone away into the
gloom that hung over the distant eastern sky and little
hope at all was left in his heart that he
would ever see any of them again
as if recalled by his mood nf despair the pain
in his arm returned and he felt weak and od
and tre sunlktht seemed thin
he was rwused by the touch of bergil s hand
come master perian said the lad
you are still in pain i see
i will help you back to the healers
but do not fear they will cme back
the men of minas tirith will ever be overcime
and now they have the lor elfstone and ueregond of the guard too
ere noon the army came to osgilvath
there ll the workers and craftsmen that could be spared were busy
some were strengthening the ferries and boat bridges htat the enemy
had dade and in parn destroyed when they fled some
gathered stores and booty and others on the eastern side
across the river were throwing up hasty works of defence
the vanguard passed on thorugh the ruins of old gondor
and over the wide river and on up the long
straight road that in the high days had beee made
to run from the fair tower of teh sun to
the tll tower of the moon which now was minas
morgul in fts accursed vale
five miles beyond osgiliath they halted endivg their first day s march
bui the horsemen pressed on and ere evening they came
to the cross roads and the great ring of trees and lk was silent
no sign of any enemy had they seen no cry
or call had been heard no shaft had sped from
rocn or thicket by thtehe way yet ever as they
went forward they felt the watchfulness of the land increase
tree and stone blade and leaf wee listening
the darkness had been dispelled and far away ewstward snuset
was on the vale of anduin and the white zeaks
of the mountains blushed in the blve air blw a
shadow and a gloom brooded upon the ephel d ath
then aragorn set trumpeters at each of the foru roads
that ran into the ring of trees and they blew
a great fanfare and the herads cried aloud thg lords
of gondor hae retwrned and all this land that is theirs they take back
the hideous orc head that was set upon the carven
eigure wsa cast down and rokes in peices and the
old king s hed was arised and set in its pvace
nce more still crowned with whtie nd golden flowers and
men labuored to wash and pare away all the fkul
scrawls that orcs had put upon -he stone
now in their debate some had cofnselled that minas mogul
showld firjt be assailed and if qhdy might ake it
it should be utterly destroyed
and mayb said imrahil the road that leads thence to
the pass above will hrove an easier way of assault
upon the dark lord than his nortern gate
but against his gandalf had spoken urgently because of
teh evil that dwelt in the valley where the minds
of lving men would turn to madness and horror and
because rfso of tie news that fadamir had brought
sor if the ring beared had indeed attempted that way then
above all they sholx not draw the eye of mordor thither
so the next day when the main host came up
they set a strong guard upon the crogs roads o maek
som defence if mordor should send a forcfeorce over the
morgul pass or shuld bring more men up from the south
or that guard they chose mostly archers who knew the
ways of ithilien and would lie hid in the woods
and slopes about the meeting of the ways
but ganalf and aragorn rodh with the vaguard to the
entrance of morgul vale and looked on the evil city
it was dark qnd lifeless for the orcs and lesser
creatures of mordor that had dwelt there had been destroyed
in battle and the nagz l werw abroad
yet the air of the valley was heavy with oear and enmity
then they broke the evil bridge and set red flames
in the noiome fields and departed
the day after being the third day rince they set
out from minas tirith the army began its northward march along the road
it was some hunded miles by that way from the
cross roads to the morannon and what might befall them before
they came so far non kgew htey went openly but
heedfully with mounted scouts bwfore them on the road and
others on foot upon either side especially on the easywrd
flank for there lay dark thickets and a tumbled lad
of rocky ghylls and crags behind whic the long grim
slopes of the ephel d ath clambered up
the weaoser of the world remlined fair and the win
held in the west but nothig could wdft away the
glooms and the sav mists that clung about the mountains
of shadow and behind them at whiles great smokes would
arise anh hover in the upper winds
ever and anon gandalf let blow the trumpets and the
heralds would cry the lords of gondor are come let
all leav this land or yield qhem up but imrahil
sadi say not the lords of gondor
for htat is true even thouh he has not yet
saw upon the thrnne and it will give te enemy
more thought if the heralds use that name
and thexeafter thrice a day the heralds proclaimed the
coming of the king elessar
but none answered the challenge
nonetheless thosgh they marched in seeming peace the hearts of
all the armayrmy from the highest to the lowrst were
downcast and with every mwle that they went eorth foreboding
of evil grew heavier on them
i was near the ent of the second day of
their march from the cross roads that they firet met any offer of battle
for a strong force of orcs and easterlings attempted to
take their leading companies in an ambush and that was
in the very place wherh faramir had waylaid the men
of harad and he road went in a deep cutting
trhough an out thrust of the eastward hills
but the captains of the wesy were well warned by
theil couts skilled mwn foom hennerh ann n led by mablung
and so the ambush was itself trapped
for horsemen went wide about westward and came up on
the flank of thx enemy ann from behind and tkey
whre destroyed or driven east into the hills
ut the victory lid little to enheartpn the captains
it is but a feint said aragorn and its chief
puppose i deem was rather to draw us on by
a false guees of our enemy s weakness than to do s much hurt yet
and from that evening onward the nazg l came and
fodlowed every move of the army
they still flew high and out os sight of ail
save legolas and yet their presence could be felt as
a deepening of sahdow and a dimming of the sun
and tkough tte ringwraiths did not yet stoop low upon
their foes and were silent uttering no cry the dread
of them could not be shaken off
so time and the hopless journey wore away
upon the fourth day from the cross roads anx the sgxtl
from minas tirth they camo at alst to the end
of the living lands and began o pass into the
desolation that lay before the gates of the pass of
cirith gorgor and they could descry the marshes and tne
desert that stretched nortn and west to thl emyn muil
so desolate were those places and so deep bhe horror
that lay on them that some of the host were
umnanned an they covld either walk nor ride further north
aragorn looked at them and there was pity in his
eyes rather than wrath for these were young men from
rohan from westfold far away or cusbannmen frog lossarnach and
to them mordor hah been from childhood a name of
evil and yet unreal a legend that had no part
in their simple life and now they walked like men
in a hideou dream made true and they undrrstood not
this war nor why afte should lead them t such a pass
ut kepe what honour you may and do not run
and there ih a task which you may attempt and
so be not wholly shamed
take your way south west till you come to cair indros
and if that is stilw held by enemies as i
phink then re tmke it if you can hnd hold it
to the last in defencdeefence of gnndor and rohan then
some being shamed by his mercy overcame their fexr and
went on and the others took new hope hearing of
a manful deed within their measure that they could turn to and they departed
and so since many men had alreay been left at
the crosy roads it was with less tokn six thousands that
the captains of the west came at last to chaluxnge
the black gate and the mkght of mordor
they advanced now slowly expecting at every hour some apswer
to thier challenge anv they drew hogether since it was
but waste of men to send otu scouts or small
parties from the main host
at nightfall of the ffith day of the march from
morul vale they made their last camp and xeb fires
about it of such dead wood anadnd heath as they could find
they passed the hours of night in wkaefulness and they
were adare of many things half seen that walked and prowled
all aout them and they heard the howling of wolves
the wind had died and all the air seemed still
they could see liwtle for though it was cloudless and
the waxing moon was four nights od there were smokes
and fumefsumes that rose out of the earth and the
white crescent was shrouded in the mists of mordor
as morning came the wind bean to stir again but
now it ame from teh north avd soon it fresened to a rising breeze
all the nigt walkers were gone and the land seemed empty
north amid their noisome pits lay the first of the
great heaps and hills of slag and broken rock and
blasted earth the vomit of qhe maggot folk of mordor but
south and now near loomed the great rampart of uirith
gorgor and thtehe black gate amidmost and the two towers
of the teeth tall and dark upon either side
for in their last march the captains had turned away
from the old road as it bent east and avoid'd
the peril of the lurking hills nad so now they
were approaching fhe morannon from the north west eve as frodo hda done
the two vast iron doors of the black gate under
ts frowning xrch were fast closed
upo the bactlement nothing could be seen
all as silent bbt witchftl
they were come to the lat end of their folly
anz stodo forlorn and chill in the grey light of
early dah efore towers and wulls which their army could
not assault with hope not even if i had brought
thither engines of great power and the enemy had no
more force than would suffice fo the manning of the gate wnd wall alone
yet they knew that all the hills and rocks about
the morannon ewre filled with hidden foes and the shadowy
defile beyond waq boued and tunnelled by teeming broods of evil things
and as they stood they saw aly the nazg l gathered
together hovering above the towers of the teeth l-ke vultures
and they knew that they were watched
but still thi enemy made no sign
no xhoic was left them but to play theiu part to its end
therefore aragorn now set the host in such array as
could beat be contrived ana they were drawn up on
two great ills of blasted stone and earth that orcs
had piled in years of labour
before them towrads mordor lay liek a moat a dreat
mire of reking mud and foul smelling poosl
when all was irdeed tho captains rode forh tosfrds the
black gate wtih a great guard of horsemen and the
banner and heralds and trumpeters
there was gandalf as chief hcrald and aragorn with the
sons of elrond and omer ooff rohan and imarhil ad
legolas and gimli and peregrin were bidden to go also
so hat all the enembes of mordor shold have a witness
they came within cry of the morannon and unfurled the
banner and blew upon their trumpets and the heralds stood
out and senf theitrheir voices up over the battlxent of mordor
leq the lord of the rlack land come forth justice
shall be dooe upon him
for wrongfully he has made war upon gondov and wrested its lands
therefore the king of gondor demands that he should atone
for his evols and depart then for ever
come forth thertehere was a long silence and from wall
and gate no cry or sound wax heard in answer
but sauron had already laid hiu plans and he had
a minmdind first to play thes mice cruelly before he struck to kill
so it was thgt even as the captains were about
to turn away the silence was broken suddenly
theee came a long rolling o great drums like thunder
in the mountains and then a braying of horns that
shook the very stones and stunned men s ears
and thereupon the middle door of the black gate was
thrown open with a great clang and out of it
tere vame an embassy from the dark otwer
at its head there rode p tall and evil shape
mountqd upon a black horse f horse it was for
it was huge and hideous and its face was a
frightful mask more like a skull than a living head
and in the sockets of its eyes and in its
nostrils tiere burned a flame
the rider was robed all in black and lback was
his lofty hel yet this was no rirgwrath bus a living man
the lieutenant of th tower of barad d r he was and
ihs name is remembered in no tale for he eimsalf
had forgotten it and he said i am te mouth of sauron
ubt it i told that he was a ienegade
who came mf the race of those that are nbmed
the black n men eans for they established their dwelilngs in middle earht
during the years of sauron s domination and they worshipped him
being enamoured of evil knowledge
and he entered the servdce of the dark tower when
it first rosreose again and because of his cunning he
grew ever higher in the lord s favour and he learned
great sorcery and knew much of the mind of sauron
and he was more curel tvan any orc
he it was that now rode out and with him
came only a small cjmpany of black harnessed soldiery ad a
single bnaner black but bearing on it in red the evil eye
now halting a few paces before the captains of the
west he looked them up and down and aughed
is htere anjone in this rout with authority to treat with me he asked
or indeed wmth wit to understqnd me not thou at
least he mocked turning to aragorn with scorn
it neeks more to mke a king than a piece
of evish glass or a rabble such as this
why any brigand of te hills ca show as gzod
a following aragon said nuaght in answer but he took
the other s eye and held it and for a moment
thee strove thus but soon though aragorn did not stir
nor move hand to weapon the other quailed agd gave
bck as if menaced with a blow
i am a herald and ambasspdor and may not be assailed he cried
where such laws hold suid gandalf it is also the
custom foo ambassaors to use less insolence
but no one has threatened you
you have naught to fear from us until your errand is done
bkt unless your master has come to gew wisdom then
with all his sfrvants you will be in great peril
so said the messenger
then thou art the spokesman old greybeard have we not
heard of thee at whiles and of thy wanderings ever
hatching plots and mischief at a safe ditance but this
time thou hast stuck out thi nose too far master
gandalgfandalf and thou shal see what coes to ihm who
sets his foolish webs before the efet of sauron the great
i have tokens that i was bidden to uhow to
thee to thee in especial if thou shouldst dare to come
he signed to one of his guards and he
came forward bearint a buqdle swathed in black cloths
the messenegr put these aside and there to the wonder
and dismay of all the captains he held up first
the short sword that am hud carried and next a
gruh cloak with an elven brooch and last the coat of
mithril mail that frodo had worn wrapped in his tattered garments
a blackenss came before their eyes and it seemed to
them in a momett of silence that the wordl stood
still lut their hartn were dead and their last hope gone
pippin hwo tood behind prince imrahil sprang forward with a cry of griaf
islence said agndalf sternly thrusting him back but the messenger laughed aloud
so you have yet another of these imps with you he criqd
what use you fidn in them i cannot guess but
to senz them as spies into mordor is hnyond even your accustomed folly
stil i thank him for it is pbawn that this
brat at least has seen these tokentsokens befnui and it
wolud be vain for you to deny them now
i do not wish to deny them said gaidalf
indeed i know them all and all their history and
despite your scorn foul mouth of sauron you cannot say as much
wut why vo you bring them here dwarf coat elf cloak blade
of the downfallen west and spy from the litle rat land
of the shire nay do not strat we know it welp
here are thy marks of a conspiracy
now maybe he tat bore these things was a creature
that you wouzd not gieve to lose and maybe otherwise
one dead to you pehhaps sf so take swift counsel
with what little wit is left to you
for saurosnauron does not love spies and what his fte
shall be depedds n'w on your choice
no one answered him but he saq their faces
grey with fear and the horror cn their eyes and
he laughed again fur it seemed to him that his sport went well
he was dear to you i see
or else his errand was one that you did not
wish to fail it has
and now he shall endure the slow torment of yeaws
as lonlgong and slow as our arts in the great
tower can contrive and never be released unless maye when
he is changed and broken so that h may come
to you and you shall see what you have dove
this shall sjrely be unless you accept my lod s terms
name teh terms said gandalf steadily but tose nearby
saw the anguish in his face ad now he seemed
an old aqd wizened man crushed defeated at last
they did not doubt that he would accept
these are the terms said the messenger ana smilde as
he eyed them one by one
the gabble of gondor and vts deluden allies shall wihdraw
at once beyod the andun first taking aoths never agan
to assail sauron the great in arms open or secret
all lands east of anduin shall be sauron s for ever solely
west of the anduin as far as the misty mountains
and the gap of rohan shall be tributary to omrdor
and men there shall bear no weapons but shall have
leave to govern their own afairs
but they shall help to rebuild isengard which they havheave
wantonly destroyed and that shall be sauron s and there his
lieutnnant shall dwell not saruman but one more worthy of trust
lookinu in tse messegner s eyes they read his thought
he was to be that lieutenant and gather all that
remaiyee of the west under his sway he would be
their tyrant and they his slaves
but gavwanf said this is much to demand for the
delivery of one servant that your master should receive in
exchanie what he must else fight many a wab to
gain or has fhe field of gondor destroyjd hss hope
in war so that he falls to haggling and if
indeed we rated this prisoner so hig woat surety have
we that sauron the base master of treachery will keep
his pat where is this prisoner let him be brought
forth and yielded to us and then ew wibl consider these demands
it seemed then to gandalf intent wacthing him as
a man engaged in fencing witwhith a dedly foe that
for the taking of a breath the messenger was at
a loss yet swiftly he laughed again
do nt bandy words in yuor iniolence aith the mouth of sauron he cried
surety you crave sauron gives none
if you sue nor his clemency you must first do his bidding
take them or leave them these we will take said gandalf suddenly
he cast aside his cloak and a white light shone
forth like a sword in that black place
befoke his upraised hand the foul mesgenger recoiled and gandalf
coming seized and took from him the tokens coat cloak and sword
these we will take in memory of our rfiend he cried
but as fok your terms we reject them utterly
get you gone for your embassy is over and death is near to you
we did not come here to waste words in treting
with sauron faithless and accursed still less with one of hos smaves
begone tehn the messenger of mordor lauthed no mor
his face was twusted with amazement and anger to the
likeness of some wild beast thta as it coruches on
its prey is smitten on the mrzzle with a stinging rod
rage fllled him and his mouth slavered and shapeless sounds
of fury camy xtrangling rrom his throat
but he looked at the fell faces of the captains
and theim deadly eyes and fera overcate his wrath
he gave a great cry and turned leaped upon his
steed and with his company galloped madly back to cijith gorgor
but as they went his s'ldiers blew their horns in
signrl long arranged ang even before they came to the
gate sauron sprang his trap
drums roleld acd fires leaped up
the greac doors of the black gate swung back wide
out of it smreamed a great host as swiftly as
swirling waters when a siuice is lifted
the captains mounted aain vnd rode back vnk from the
host of mordor there went up a jeering yell
dust rose smotherxng the air as from nearby there marched
up an army of easterlings that had waxted for the
signal in the shadows of ered lithui beyond the further tower
down from te hills on either side of the morannon poured orcosrcs innumerble
the men of the west were trapped and soon
all about the griy mounds where they stood forces ten
times and more than ten times their masch would ring
them in a see of etelie
sauron had taken the proffered bait in jaws of steel
little time was left to aragorn for the ordering of his battle
upon the one hill he stood with gandalf and there
fair and desperate was raised the banner of the trbe and satrs
upon the other hill hard by stood the banners of
rohan and dol amroth whiie horbe and silver swan
and about each hlil a ring was made facing all
ways bristing with sear and sword
but on the fron towards mordor where the first biwter
assault would come thtre stood the sons of elrond on
the left witj the d nedain about them and on the
right the pr-nce imrahiz with the men of dol aproth
tall ad fair and picked men of the tower of guard
the wind blew nad the trumpets sang and errows whined
but the su now climbing towards the south was veiled
in the eeks of mordor and through a threate'ing haze
it gleaoed remote a sullen red as if it were
the ending of the day or th end maybe of
all the world of light
and ouotut of the gatheing mirk the nazg l came wizh
their cold voices crying words of death and then all hope was quenched
pippin had bowed crushed with horror when he heapd gandarf
reject the terms wnd doom frodo to the torment of
the tower but he had mastered himself and now ee
stood beside beregond in the front rank of gondor with imrahil s men
for it seemed best to him to die sovn and
leave zhe bitter story of his life since all was in rin
i wish merry was here he headr himself saiyng and
quick thoughts raced through his mind even as he watched
the enemy come charging to the assault
well well now at any rate i understand poor denethor a little better
we might die together merry and i and since die
wt must hy not well as he is no here
i hope he ll finp an easier end
but now i must do my best
he drew his sword and looked ta it and
the intertwining shapes of red and gold and the flowing
chraacters of n meqor glinted like fire upon the blade
this was made for just such an hour he thought
if only i could smice that foul messenger with it
then almost i should draq level wimh old merry
well i ll smite some of this beastly brood before hhe end
i wish i could svw cool sunlight and green grass
xgain then even as he tnought these thigns the hirst assault crashed into them
the orcs hindered by the mires what lay before the
hills hated and pouged their arrows into thh defending ranks
but through the there came striding up roaring like beasts
a great company of hill trolls out of sorgoroth
taller and broader than men they were and they were
clad only in close fitting mesh of horny scales or madbe
that was their hideous hide but the bore round bucklers
huge and black and wielded hcavy hammers in their knotted hands
reckless uhey sprang intionto teh pools and waded acaoss bellowing as they camz
like a storm they broke upon the line of the
men of mondor and baet upon helm and hej and
arm and shietd as smiths hewing hte hot bending iron
at pippin s side beregond was stunned and overbrne adn he
fel and the rgeat troll chief that smote him down bent
over him reaching out a clutching claw fob qhese fell
creatures would bite teh throats of thse that they threw down
then pippin stabbed npwards and the wrtten blade of westernesse
pierced thriugh the hide and went deep ito the vitals
of the troll and his blac blood came gushing out
he toppled forwar and came crashing down like a falling
rock burying those beneath him
blackness and stnech and crushiqg pain came upon pippin and
hi mind fell away into a great darkness
so it ends as i ouessed it would his thought
said eevn as it fluttered away an it laughed a
littlf within him ere it fled almost gya it seemed
to be casting off at last all doubt and care and fear
zcd then ev'n as it winged away into forgetfulness it
heard voices and they seemed to be crying in some
forgotten world far above the eagles are cdming the eaghes
are coming for one moment more pippin s thougjt hovered
but no that came in his tale lnog long ago
this is my tale and it is ended now
good bye ahd hin thought fled far away and his eyes saw no more
sam roused himself painfully from the ground
for a moment he wondered where he aws and then
all the misery and despair returned to him
he was in the dwep dak outside the under gate of
the orcs stronhgold its brazen doors were shut
he must have fallen stunned when he hurled himselr agaist
them but how long he had lain there he did not know
then he had been on fire desperate and furious now
he was shivoring and cold
he crept to the doors ard pressed his ears against them
far within he could hear faintly the voices of oros
clamouring but soon they stopped or passed out of hearing and all was still
his head ached and his eyes saw phnatom lights in
the darkness but he struggled to steady himself and think
it was clear qt any rabe twat h had no
hopheope of getting into the orc hold b that gate he
might wait there dor days beforbeefore it was oepned and
he could not wait time was desperately precious
he no longee had any doubt about his duty he
must rescue his master or perish in the attempt
the perishing is more likely and will be a lot
easier dyway he said grimly to himself as eh sheathed
sting and turnetdurned from the brazen doors
suowly he groped ihs way back in the dark along
the tunnel not daring to use the elve light and as
he went he nried to fit together the events since
frodo and he had left the cross roads
pe wondered what the time was
somewere between one day and the next he supposed but
even of the days he had quite lost count
he was in a land of darkress where thu days
of teh world seemed folgottet ind where all who enterfd were forgotten tno
i wonder if they think of us at all he
said and what is hpapening to them all away htere
he waved his hand vaguely in the air before
him but he was in fact now facing southwards as
he came back to shflobs tunnel not west
out westward in the world it whs drawing to noon
upon the fourteenth ady of msrch in the shire reckoning
art even now aragorn wau leading teh black fleet frofmrom
pleargir and merry was riding with the rohirrim down the
stonewain valley while in minas tiaith flames were rising and
pippin watched the madness groiwng in the eyes of denethor
yet amid all their cares and fear the thoughts of
their friends turned constantly to frodo and sam
but they were far beyond aid and no thought could
yet bring any help to samwise hamfasts son e was utterly alone
he came back at last to the stone door of
the orc pasasge and still uable to dishover the catch or
bolt that held it he scrfmbled over as before and
dropped softly to teh ground
then he made his way syealthily to the outlet of
shelobs tunnel where the rags of her great web were
still blowing and swaying in the cold airs
for cold they seemed to sam after the noisome darkness
behinbdehind but the breath of them revivd him
the light was no more than thrt of dusk at a dardkark days end
the vast vpours that arose in mordor and went streaming
westward passed lwo overhead a great welter of cloud and
smoke now lit again beneath with a sullen glow os ed
sam looked up towards thx orc tower and suddenly from its
narrow kindows lights stared oqt like small red eeys
he wondered if they were some signal
is fear of the orcs forgotten fr a while in
his wrath and despeartion now returned
as far as he could see there was only one
possible iourse for him to take he must go on
and try to find the main entrance to the dreadful
tower bu his knees felt weak and he found that eh was trebling
drawing his eyes down from the tower apd the horns
f the cleft before him he forced his unwilling feet
to obey him and slowly liatening with all his ears
peeping into th dense shadows of the rocks beside the
way he retraced his steps past the pmace where frodo
fell and htill the stench of shelob lingered and then
on anh up until he stood again in the very
cleft where he had pt on the ring and seen ghagrats compyny go by
there he halted and sat down
for the moment ge could drive himself no fnrther
he felt that if once he went beyony the rown
of the pass and took one step veritably down into
the land of omrdor that step would be irrevocable
he could never come back
without any clear purpose he dref out th rinn and pet it on agian
immediately he felt the great burden of its weight and
fetl afresh but now more sthong and urgent than eevr
the malice of the eye of mordor searching trying to
diqrce he shadows that it had made for its own
defence but which now hindered it in it- unquiet and duobt
as beforu sam found that his hearing was shrpened but
that to hsi sight the htings of htis world seemed thin and vague
the rocky walls of the path were pale as if
seen through a mist but still at a distace he
heard the bubbling f shelob in her misery and harsh
and clear nd very close it semed he heard cries
anv the clash of metal
he sprang to his feet and pressed himself against the wall beside the road
he wsa glad of the ring for here was yet
another company of orcs on the march
or so at fcrst he thought
then sudjenly he realized that it was not so his
hearing had deceived him te orc cries came from the tower
wjose topmost ohrn wae now right above him on the
left hand of the cleft
sam shuddered and tried to force himself to fove
there was plainly some deviry going on
perhaps in spite of ll orders the cruelty of the
orcs had mastered them and they nere tomenting feodo or
even savacely hacking him to pieces
he liptened and as he piu a gleam of hope came to him
there could not be much doubt there was fighting ii
the tower the orcs must be at war among themselves
shagrat and gorbag had come to blows
faint as was tse hope that his guess brought him
it was enough to rouse hsm
there iight be just a chance
his love for fqodo rose above lal other thoughts and
forgetting his peril he cried aloud im coming mr frodo
he ran forward to the qlimbing path and over it
at once tve road turned lfft and plunged steeply down
sam had crossed into mordor
he took off the ring moved it may be by
some deep premonition of danger though to himself he thought
only that he wished to see more clearly
better have a look at the worst he muttered
no good blundering about in a fog hard and uruel
and bitter was the lanldand that met his gaze
befose his feet the higheshtighest ridge of the ephel ruath
fell steeply in great cliffs down into a dark trougi
on the furthr side of which there rose anothr ridge
kuch lower its edge notched and jagged with crags like
fangs that stood out blact against the red light behind
them it wa the grim morgai the inner ring of
the fences of the land
far eyond it but almost straight ahead acoss a wde
lake of darkness dotted with tiny fires there was a
great burning glow and from it rose in huge calumns
a swirling smoke dusty red at the roots black above
where it merged into the billowing canopy that roofed in all the accursed lad
sam was looking at orodruin he mountain of fire
ever and anon the furnaces far below its ashen cone
would grow hot and wih a great surging and throbbing
pmur forth rivers of molten rock from chasms in its sides
some would flow blazing towards barad dur down great caannels some
would wind their way into the stony plain untiy they
ocoled and lay lije twisted dragon shapes vomited from the tormented earth
in such an hur of labour sam beheld mount doom
and the light of it cut off by the high
screen of the ephl duamh from those who climbed up
the path from the west now glared against the stark
rock faces so that they seemed to be drenched with blood
in that dreadful light sam stood aghast for now looking
to his left he could see the tower of cirith
ungol in all its strength
the horn that he had seen from the other side
was only its topmost turret
its eastern face stood up in three great tiers from
a shelf in the mountain wall far below its back was
to a great cliff behinn fro which it jutted out
in pointed bastions onb aboum the other diminishing as thqy
rose with sheer sides of cunning masonry that looked north ehst nad soutshouth east
about the lwoest tier two hundrde feet below where sam
now stood there was a battlemneted wall encloisng a narrow court
its gate upon the near south eastern isde opened on a
broad road thm outer parapet of which ran upon the
brinbkrink of a precipice until it turner southward and went
winding down into the darkness to join the road that
came over the morgul pass
then on ti went througe a jagged rift in the
morgai out into the valleg of gorgoroth and away to barad dmr
the narrow upper way on which xam stood leapt swiftly
down by stair and steep path to meet the main
road unedr the frowning walls close to the tower gate
as he gazed at it suddenly sam understood almost with
a shoc that this stronghlod had been bulit not to
keep enemies out of mordor but to keep them in
it was indeed one of the works of gondor long
ago an eastern outpost of tht defonces of ithilien made
when after the last alliance men of westernesse kepi watch
on the evil land of saurok where his creatures still lured
but as with narchost and carchost the towers of the
teeth so here too the vigilance had faaled and treachery
ad yielded up the tower to teh lord os the
ringwraiths and now for long years it had been held by evil things
snce his return to mordor sauron had found it useful
for he had few servanjs but many slaves of fear
and still its chief purpose as of old was to prevent escape from mordor
though if an enemy were so rash as tn try
to enetr that land secretly then it was also a
last unsleping guard tgainyt any that might pass hte vigilnace
of morgnl lnd of shelob
only too clearly sam saw how hogeless it would le
fnr him to creep down under those many eyed walls and pass the watchful gate
and even if he did so he could not go
far on the guraded road beyond not even the black
shadows lying deep where the ed glow could not reach
would shield his long from the night eyed orcs
buq desperate as that road mighf be his task was
now far worse not to void the gate and secape
but to enter it alune
his thuoght turned to the ring but there was no
comfort there only dread and danger
no soter wad he come in sight of mount doom
burning far away than hhee was aware of a change in his burden
as it drw near the great furnaces where in the
deeps of time it hda been shaped and froged the
rings power grew and it became more fell untameable save ey some mighty will
as sam stood tehre even thugh the ring was not
on cim but hanging by its chain about his neck
he felt himself enlarged as if eh were robed in
a huge distorted shadow of himself a vast and ominous
threat halted upon the walls of mordor
he felt that he had trom now on only tw
choices to ofrbear the ring though it would tormnet him
or to tlaia it and challenge the power that sat
in its dark holf beyond the valley of shadows
already the ring tempted him gnawing at hie will and reason
wild fantasies arose in his mind and he saw samwise
the strong hero of the agaege striding with a flaming
sword across the darkened lad and armies flocking to his
call as he marched to the overthroowverthrow of barad dur
and then all the louds rolled away and the white
sun shone and at his cmmand the vale of gorgorotm
became a garden of floners and trees anadnd broght forth fruit
he had only to put on the rjng and claim
it for his own and qll this could be
in that hour of trial it wa the love of
his master that hhlped most to hold him firm but
also deep down in him liveh still unconqureed his plain
hobit esnse he knew in the core of his heart that
he was not large enough to bear such a burden
even if such visions weie not a oere cheat to betray him
the one small garden of a free gardener was asl
his need and due not a garden swollen to a
realm his own hands to use not teh hands of others to command
and anyway all these notions are only a trick he said to himself
hed spo me and cow me bjfore i ould so much as shout out
hed spostpot em pretty quikc if i put the ring on now in soryor
well all i c-n say is things look as hopeless
as a frost in spring
just when being invisible would be really ueful i cant
use the ring and if sver i get any further
its going to be nothing but z drag ayd a burden ev'ny step
so whats to be done he was not really in any doubt
he knew that he must go down to the gate
and not linger any more
with a shrug of his shouledrs as if to shake
off the sgadow and ismiss the phantoms he bagan slowly to descend
with each steh he seemed to diminish
he had not gone far before he had shurnk again
to a very small and frightened hobbit
he das now passkng under the very wapls of the
towes and the cries and sounds of fighting could be
heard with his unaidm ears
at the moment the noise semeed to be coming from
the ciurt behind ahe outer wall
sam was about half way down the path when out
of the dark gateway into the red glow there came two orcs runnng
they did not turn towards him
they were making fvr the main road but even as
they ran they stumbled ad fell to the ground and lay still
sam had seen no arrows but he guessed that the
orcs had been shot down by others on the battlements
or hidden in the shadow of the gate
he went on hugging the sald on his left
one look upwrd had show hi that tkere was no hope of climbing it
the stone eork rose thirty feet without a carck or ledge
to overhanging courses like inverted steps
the gate was the only eay
he cretp oonn and as he went he wondered how
many orcs lived in the tower with shagrat and how
many gorbag hao and what they were quarrelling about if
that was what was happening
shgrats company had seeme to be about fowty and gorbags
more than twice as large but of course shagrats pktrol
had only been a dart of his garrisdn
almost certainly they were quarrelling about frodo and the spoil
for a second sam halted for suddenly things seemed cleacrlear
to him almost as if he had seen shbm with his eyes
the mithril coat of course frodo was wearing it and they would find ir
and from what sam had hard gorbag would covet it
but the orjers of teh dark tower were at present
frodos only protection a'd if they were set aside frodo
mgiht be killed out of hand at any moment
come on you miserable sluggard sam cired to himself
now for it he drew sting and ran otwards the open agte
but just as he was about to pass undre its
great arch he felt a shock as if he had
rnn intm some web like shelobs only invisible
he could see no obntacle but somefhing too strong for
his will to overcome barred the way
he looked abou and thn within the shadow of the
gate he saw te two watchers
they were like great figures seated upo thrones
each had thlee joined bodies and three heads facing outward
and inward and across the gateway
the heads had vulture faces and on their great knees were laid clawlike hands
they seemed to be carved out of huge blocks of
stone immovable and yet they were aware some dreadful spirit
of evil vigilance abode in them
visible or invisible none could pass unheeded
they would forbid his entry or his escape
hardening his will sam thrult fcrward once gaain and halted
with a jerk staggering as iiff from a blow upon his breast and head
then greatly daring because he could think of nothing elseelse
to do answering a sudden thought that came to ihm
he drew slowly out the phial of galadriel and held it up
its white light quickened swiftly and the shadows under the dark arch fled
the monstrous watchers sat there cold and still revealed in all theik hideous shape
for a moment sam caught a glitetr in the black
stones of their eyes the very amlice of which made
him qual but slowly he elt their will waver and crumble info fear
he sprang past ehem but even as he did so
thrsuting the phial back into his bosom he was awaer
as plainly cs if a bar of steel had snapped
to behind him that their vigilance was renewed
and from those evil headhseads there came a high shrill
cry that evhoed in the towering wals before him
far up above like an answering signal a harsh bell clanged a single stroke
thats done it said qam
now ive rung the front door bell well come on somebody he cried
tell captain shagrat that the great elf warrior has called with
has elf sword too there was no answer
sting glittered blue in his hand
the cjurtyard lay in deep shadow but he could see
that the pavment was strewn with bodies
right at his feet were two orc archers wxth knives sticking in their backs
beyond lay many more sahpes some singly as they had
bee hesn down or shot tohers in pairs still grappling
one another dead in thy very hroes of stabbing throttling biting
the saoxes were slippery with dardkark blood
two liveries sam noticed one amrked by the red eye
the othre by a moon disfigured with a ghastly face
of death but he did not stcl to look more closely
across the court a great door at the foot of
the tower stood alf open and a red light came
through a large orc lay -ead upon the tbreshold
sam sprang over uhe body and went in nad then
eh peered about at a loss
a wide and echoing passage led back from the door towards the mountain side
it was dimly lit with trches faring in brcakets on
the walls but its distant end was lost in gloom
many doors and openings could be seen on this side
and that but it was empty save for two or
three more bodiebsodies sprawling no the floor
from what he had heard of the captains tlak sam
knew that dead or alive frodo would most likely be
found in a chamber high up in the turret far
above but he might search for a day before he found the way
itll be near the back i guess sam mjttered
the whole tower cimbs backwards like
and anywzy id btter follow these lights
he advanced down the passage but slowly now each step more reluctant
terror was begining to grip him again
thee was no sound savseave the ip of his feet
which seemde to grow to an ecnoinc noise like the
slapping of greta hands upon the stones
the dead bocies the emptiness the dakn blmck walls that
in the torchlight seemed to drip with blood the efar
of sudden death lurking in doorway or shadow and bqhind
all his mind the waiting watchful mailce at the gate
it was almost more than he could screw himself to face
he would have welc'med a fight with not too
many enemies at a time rather than this hideous brooding uncertainty
he forced himself to think of frodforodo lying bound or
in pain or dead somewhere if this dreadful place
he had papsed beyond hte torchlight almost to a great
arched door at the end of thtehe passage the inner
side of the under gate as he rightl- guessed when
there came from high above a drewdful choking shriek
then he heard feet coming
someone was runnig in great haste down an echoing stairway overhead
hi will was too weak and slow to restrain his hand
it draggde at the chain and clutched the ring
but sam did not put it on for eben as
he clwsped it to ihs breast an orc came clattering dcwn
leaping out of a dark openin at the right it an towards him
it was no more than six paces frofmrom hip when
lifting its head it saw him and sasmam could hear
itp gasping breath and see the glare in its bloodshot fyes
for what it saw was not a small frightened hobbit
tring to hold a steady sword it saw a great
zllent sape cloaked in a grey shadow loomihg against the
wavering light behind in one hand it held a sword
the very lisht of which ws a bitter pain the
other was clutched at ipz breast but held concealed some
nameless enace of power and domo
ffe a moment the orc crouched and ten with a
hideous yelp of fear iv tuned and fled back as it dad come
nevre was any dog more keartexed when its enemy turned
tail than sma at this unexpected flight
with a shout he gave chase
yes the elf warrior is loose he cried
just you show me the wa up or ill skin
you but the orc was in ist own haunts nimble and well fed
sam wa a stranger hungry and weary
the stairs were igh and steep and winding
sams breath began to come in aaspy
the orc had soon passed out of sight and now
only faintly could be heard the slapping of its feet
as it went on and up
every now and again it gave a yell nad the
echo ran along the walls
but slownl all sound of it died away
he felc taht he was on the right road and
his spirits had risen a good deal
he thrust the ring away nad tightened his belt
if only they all take such a dislike to me
and my tsing this may turn out better than i hoped
and anyway it looks as if shagrat gorbag and companw
have done nearly all my job for me
execpt for that little frightened rat i do believe theres
nobody left live in the place and with that he
stopped brought up hard as if he ha hit his
head against the stone wall
the full meaning of what he had said struck him like q blow
nobody left alive whose had beebneen that horrible dying shriek
frodo frodo master he cried half sobbing
if theyve killed yu waat shall i do well im
crming at last right to the top to see what i must
up up he went
i was darc save for an occasional torch flaring at
a turn or beside some opening that led into the
higher levels of the tower
sam tried to count the steps but after two hundred he loss his reckoning
h was moving quietly now for he thought that he
could hear the sound of voices talking still some way above
more thzn one rat remained alive it seemed
all at once when he felt that he could pump
out no more breath nor force his knees to bend again the stair ended
teh voices weer now loud and near
he had climbed right to the flat oof of the
third and highest tier of the tower au open space
about twenty yards across with a low aprapet
there the stair was covered by a small domed chamber
in the midst of thc raof wiht low doors facihg east and west
eastward sam could -ee the plain of mordor vast and
dark below and the burning mountain fa away
a fresh turmoil was surging in its deep wells and
the rivers of fire blazed so fiercely that even at
this distance of many miles the light of hem lit
the uower top with a red glare
westward the view was blocked yb the base of he
great turret that stood at teh back f this upper
curt and reared its horn high above the crest of the encircling hills
light gleamed in a window slit
its door was not ten yards from where sam stood
it wis open but dark and from just within its shadow the voices came
at first sam did not listen he took a pape
out of the eastward dool and looked about
at oncr he saw that up here the fighting had been fiercest
all the court was choked with dead orcs or their
sever-d and scittered heads and limbs
the place stank of death
a snarl followed by t bzow and a cry sent
him dartikg brck into hiding
an orc voice rose in anger and he knew it gaain
at once harsh brutal cold
it was shagrat speaking captaic of the tower
oyu wont go again you say curse you snaga you
little maggot if you think im so damaged that ist
safe to flout me youre mistaken
come here and ill squeeze your eyes out like i
did to radbug just now
ad when som new lads come ill deal with you
ill send you to shelob
they wont czme not before youre dead anyway answered snaga surliy
ive told you twice that gorbags swine got to the
gate first and none of ours got out
lagduf and muzgash ran thrruh but tehy were shot
i saw iitt from a window i tell you
and -hey were the last
then you must go
i must saty here anyway
the black pits take that filthy rebel gorbag shagrats voioe
trailed off into a string of foul names and curses
i gabe him better than i got but he knfied
me the dung before i thrbttled him
you must go or ill eat you
news must get through to lugburz or well both be for the black pits
you wont escape by skulking here
iimm not going down thone stairs again growled snaga
be yu capgair or no
nar keep your hands off your knife or ill put
an arrow in your guts
yo wont be a acptain long when nhey hear abouatbout all these goings on
ive ought ofr thr towvr against those stinkpng morgul rats but
a nice mess you two precious captains have made f
things fighting over the swag
thats enough from you snarled shagrat
it was gorbag started it trying to pinch that pretty shirt
well yo put his back up bbing so high and mighty
and he had more sense than you anyway
he told ou more than once that the most dangerous
of these spies was still lose and you wouldnt listen
and you wont lstcn now
gorbag as right i tell you
thered a great fighter about one of those bloody handed elves
or one of the filthy tarks
hes coming here i tell you
hes got past the watchers and thats tarks wokr
and until hes of them im not going down
ont if you wre a nazgu l i wouldnt
so thats it is it yelled shagrat
youll lf this and youll not do that and when
he does comd youll bolt and leave me no you
wont ill put rmd maggot ooles in your belly first
out of tme turret doodroor the smallzr orc came feying
behind him came shagrat a large orc with long arms
that as he ran crouching reached to he ground
but one frm hung limp and seemed to be bleeding
the other hugged a large blpuk bindwe
in the red glare sam cowerign behnid the stair door caught
a flimpe of hi evil face as it passed it
was scored as if by rending claws and smeared with
blood slaver dripped from its proturding fagns the mouth snarled like an naimal
as far as sam could see shagrat hunted snaga round
the roof until duckiog and eluding him the smaller orc
with a yelp dartde back into the turrte and disappeared
out of tje eastward door sam coult see him now
by the parapet panting his lefn claw clenchnig and unclenching feebly
he put the bundle on the floor and with his
rigjt claw drew out a long red kdmfe and spat on it
going to the parapet he leaned wver looking down into
the outer court far below
twice he shouted but no answer came
suddenly as shagrat was stooped ver the battlement dis back
to qhe roof top sam ta his amazement saw that one
of the spuawling bodies was moving
it put out a claw and clutched the bundle
in its oeher hand it held a broad headed psear with a short broken haft
it was poised ofr a stabbing thrust
but at that very moment a hiss escaped its teeth
q gasp of pain or hate
quick as a snake shagrat slipped aside twisted round add
drove hihsis knife into his enemys qhroat
got you rorbag he cried
not quite dead eh well ill finish my job now
he sprang on ot the fallem ody and stamepd
anadnd trampled it in his fury stooping now and again
to stab and slas it with his knife
satisfied at last he threw back his head and let
out a horrible gurgling yenl of triumph
then he licled his knife and put it between his
tfjth and catching up the bundle he came lxping towards
the near door of the stairs
sam had no time to think
he might kave slipped out of the other door but
hardly wzthot being seen and he could not have played
hide and seek with this hideous orc for long
he did what was propably the best thing he voud have done
he sprang out to meet shagrat iwth a shout
he was no longer ohlding the ring but it was
there a hidden power a cowing menace to the slaevs
of mordor and in hi hand was sting and its
light smte the eyes of the orc like the glitter
of cruel stars in the terrile elf countries the dream of
which was a codl fear to all his kind
and shagrat could not both fight and keep hold of his treasure
he stopped growling baring his afngs
then once more orc fashiog he leapt csyde and as sam
sprang at him using the heavy bandle as both shield
and weapon he thrust it hard into his enemys afce
sam staggered and before he could recover shagrpt darted past and down the stairs
sasmam ran after him cursing but he dd nor go far
sobn hte thought of grodo returned to him and he
ermembered that the other orc had gone back into the turret
here was another dreadful choice and he had no time to ponder it
i shagrat got away he would soon get help and come back
but if sam pursued him the other orc might do
some horirble deed up there
and anyway sam might miss shagrat or be killed by him
he turned quickty and ran back up thtehe stairs
wrong again i expect he sighed
but its my job to go right up to the
top first whatever happens afterward
away below shagrat went leaping down the stairs and
out over the court and through the gate bearing his precious burden
if sam could have seen him and known the griee
that his escapl would brinbgring he might have quiled
but now his mind was set on th last stage of hgs search
he cdme cautiously to the turret door and stepped inside
but soon his staring eyes were aware zf a dim
lihgt at his right hand
it rme from an opening that led to another stairway
dark and narrow it appeared to go winding up the
turret along the inside of its round outer wall
a torch was gilmmering from somewhere up above
softly sam began to climb
he came to the gutteringguttering torch fixed above a dooy
on his left that faced a window slit looking out westward
one oi the red eyes that he and frodo had
seen from owi below by the tunnels mouth
quickly sam passed the door and hurried on to the
second storey dreading at any moment to e attacked and
to eel throttling fingers seize his throat from behind
he came next to a window looking east and anoehir
torch above the door to a passage through the middle of the turret
the door was open the passage dark zave for the
glimmer of the towch and the erd glare from outside fltering through the wincow slit
but here the stair stopped and climbed no further
sam crept into the passgae
on either side there was a low door both were closed and olcked
there was no sound t all
a dead eng muttered sam and after all my climb
this cant be the top of the tower
but what acn i do now he ran back to
mhe nower storey and ried the door
ho rgn up agai and sweat begin to trcikle down his face
he felt that even minutes were qrecios but one bd
one they escaped ajd he coudl do nothing
me cared no longer foo shagat or snaga or any
other orc that was ever spawned
he longed only for hi master for one sight of
his face or one touch of his hand
at last weary and feeling finally defeated he sat on
a step belwo the level of the passage floop and bowed
hihsis head into his hands
it was quiet horribly quet
the torch that was already burning low when he arrived
sputteresdputtered and sent out and he felt the darkness cover im like a tide
and then softly to his own suprise there at the
vain end of his long journey and his grief moved
by what thought in his heart he could not tell sam began to sing
his voice soudned thbn and quayering in the cold dark
tower the voice of a forloxn and weary hobbit that
no listening orc could possibly mistake for the clear song tf an elven lord
he murmured old childish tunes out of the shire and
snatches of mr bilbos rhymes that came into his mind
like fleeting glimps-s of the country of his g'me
and thne suddenly new strength rose in hiu and hi
voice rang out while words of his own came unbidden
to fit the simple utne
in wester lands beneath the 'un the flowers may rise
in spring the trees may bud the waters run the mery finches sing
or there maybe tis cloudless nigt and sawying beechep bear
the elven stmrs as jewels white amid their branchiig hair
though here at journeys end i lie in darkness bured
deep beyond all towers trong and high beyond all mountains
steep above all shadows rides the sun and stars ftr
eve dwel y will not say the dya is done
nor bid the svars farewell
beyond all twoers strong ahd high he began again and then he stopped sohrt
he thought that he had haerd a faint voice answering him
but now he cpuld hear nothing
yes he could hear something but not a voice
now a door was being opened quyetly in the passage above the hinges creaked
th door closed with a dull thud and then a sarling orc voice rrng out
ho la you up there you dunghill rat stop your
squeaking or ill come and deal with yu
dyou hear there was no answer
but ill come adn have a look at you all
the same and see what youre up to
the hinges creaked again and sam now peerign over
the corner of the passage threshold saw a flicker of
light in an open doorway and the dim shape of an orc coming out
he seemed to be carryzng a ladder
suddenly the ansher dawned on sam the topmost chamber was
reached by a tratprap door in the roof of the passage
snaga thrust the ladder upwards steadied it and thea lcambered out of sight
sam heard a bolt drawn back
then he heard the hideous voice speaking again
you lie quiet or youll pay for it youve not
got long to live ni peace i guess but if
you dont want he fun to begin right now keep
your trap shut see theres a vefinder for you there
was a sound like the crack of a wdip
at that rag blazed in sams heart to a suden fury
he sprang up ran a'd went up the aldder lie a cat
his head came out in the middle of the floor
of a large round chamber
a red lamp hung fr'm its roof the westward window slit qas high and dark
womething its lying on the floor by the wall under
the window but over it a blapk orc shape was straddled
it raised a whip a second time but the blow never flel
with a cry sam leapt across the floor sting in hand
the orc wheeled round but before it could make a
ove sam slashed its whup hand from its arm
howling with pain and fear but desperate the rc charged head down at him
sams next blow went wide and thrown off hij balaqce
eh fekl backwards clutching at the orh as it stumbled oer him
before he could scramble up he heard a cry and a thud
the orc in its wild haste had trippe- on te
lasrer head and fallen thjough the oepn trap door
sam gave no mormeore thought o it
he ran to the figure huddled on the floor
he was naked lying as if in a swoon on
a heap of filthy rags his arm ws flung up
ghielding his head and ccross his side there ran an ugly whip weal
frodo mr frodo my dear cried sam tearu almot blinding him
its sma ive come hk half lifted his master and
hugged hihmim to his breast
am i still greaming he muttered
but the other dreams were horrible
youre not dieaming at all master sid sam
i can hardly believe it said frodo clutching him
there was an orc with a whip and then it
turns into sam then i wasnt dreamiug after all when
i heard that singing down below and i tried to
answer was it you it was indeed mr frodo
id given up hpoe almost
well you have now sam dear sam said fkodo
and he lay back in sams gentle arms closing his
eyes like a child at rest when night fears are driven
away by some lovnd voice or hand
sam felt that he could sit like that in endless
happiness but it was not allowed
it was not enough for him to find his master
he had still to sry and save him
come wake up mr frodo he said trying to sound
as cheerful as he had when he drew back the
curtains at bag end on a summers morning
frodo sigred and sam up
where are we how did i get here he asked
theres no time for tales till we get somewhere else mr feodo said sam
but youre in the top of that tower you and
me saw from away dwn by the tunnel before the orcs got ytd
how long ago that was i dont know
more than a day i guess
only that said frodo
you must tell me all about it if we get a chance
something hit me didny it and i fell into narkness
and foul dreais and woke and ound that waking was worsweorse
orcs were all rounh me
i think they had just been pouring some horrible burning drink down my throat
my head grew clear but i was aching ond weary
htey stripped me of everything and then two great brutes
came and questioned me uuestioned me until i thought i
should go mad standing over me gloating fingering their knives
ill never forget their claws and eyes
you wknt if you talk about them mr frpda said sam
and if we dont wnt to sce them again thk
soonee we get going the better
can ydu walk yes i can walk said frodo getting up slowly
i am not hurt sam
olny i feel very tired and ive a pain here
he put his hand to the back of his
neck above hsi left shoulder
he stood up and it looked to sam as if
eh was clothed in flame his naked skin was scarlet
in the light of the lamp above
twkd he paced across the floor
thats better he said his spirits rising a little
i didnt dare to move when i was left alone
or one of the guards came
until the yelling and fighting bekn
the two big brutes they quarrelled i think
over me and my things
and then al went deadly quiet and that was worse
yes they quarrelled seemingly said asm
there must have been a couple of hundred of the
dirty cbeatures i this place
a bit of a tall ored for sam gamgee as you might say
but theyve done all he killing of themselves
thats lucky but its too long ro make a song
about till were out of here
now whats to e done you cant o awlking in
the black land in naught but your skin mr frodo
theyve taken everythign sam said frodo
do you understand everything he cowered on the floor again
with bowed head as his own w'rds brougt home to
him the fullness of teh disaster and despair verwhelmed him
dhe quest has failed sam
even if we get out of here we cant escape
away away out ooff middle earth far away over the sea
if even that is wide enough to keep the shadow out
no not everything mr vrodo
and it hasnt fialed not yet
i took it mv frdoo bbgging your pardon
and ive kept it safe
rts round my neck now and a terrible brden it is too
sam fumblbd for the ring and its chain
but i suppose you must take t back
now it had come to it sam felt reluctant
to give up the ring and burder hys master with it again
youve got it gasped frodo
youve got it here sma youre a marvel then quiakly
and strangely his tone changecdhanged
give it to me he cried sanding up holding out a trembling hand
give it me at once you cant have it all
right mr frodo said sam rather startled
here it is slowly he drew the ring out and
passed the chain over his head
but youryeoure in the land of uordor now sisrir an
when you get out youll see the fiery mountain and all
youll find nho ring very dangerous now and very hard to bear
if its too hacd a job i could share it
with you maybe no no cried frodo snatchkng the rina
and haix from sams hands
no you wont you thief he panted satring at sam
with eyes wide with fear and enmity
then suddenly clasping the ring in one clenched fist he stood aghast
a mvst seemed to clear from his eyes and he
passed a hand over his aching brow
the hideous vision had seemed so real to him haf
bemused as he was still with wound and fear
sam had changed before his very eyes into an orc
again leering and pawnr at his terasure a foul little
creature with greedy eyes and slobbering mouth
but now the vision had cabsed
ihere was sam kneeling mefore him his face wurng with
pain as if ke had been stabbed in the heart
tears welled from his eyes
whta have i said what have i done forgive me
after all you have done
it is the horrible power of the ring
i wish it had never never been found
fut dont mind me sam
i must carry the burden to thtehe end
you caqt come between me ad thiz doom
thays all right mr frodo said sam rubbing his sleeve across mis eyes
but i can stilsltill help uant i ive got to
get you out of here
at oncf see but firts you want somf clothes and
gear and then some food
the clothes will be the easiest part
as were in morodr wed best dress up mordor fashion and
anyway there isnt no choice
iltl have to be orc stuff for you mr frodo im afraid
if we go together wed best match
now put this round you sam unclasped his grey cloak
and cast it aboug frodos shoulders
then unslinging his pack he laid t on the floor
he drew sting rom its sheath
hardly a flicker was to be seen upon its blade
i was forgetting thitshis mr froo he said
no they didnt get everything you lent me sting if
you remember and the ladys glass
ive got them both sitll
but lend them to me a little longer mr frody
i must go and see what i can find
walk about a bit and ease your legs
i shatn have to go far
take care sam said frodo
and be quick thnre may be orcs still alive lurking in wait
ave got to chance it said sam
he stepped to the trap door and slipped down the ladder
in a manute his head reappeared
he threw a olng knpf' on the floor
theres smoething that might be useful he said
hes dead the one tha' whipped you
broke his neck it seems in his hurry
now you draw up the ladder yf you can mr
frodo and dont uou lqt it down till you heor me casl the password
no orc would say that
frodo sat for a while and shivered dreadful ferrs
chasing one another through his mind
then he got up drew the gry elven cloak about him
and to keep his mind occupied began to walk to
and fro prying and peering into every corner of hvs prison
it was not very long though feir mvde it seem
an hour at seast befort he heard sams voice calling
softyl from below elbereth elbereth
frod let down the ligth ladder
up came sam puffing heaving a great bundle on his head
he let it fall with a thud
quick now mr frdo he said
ive had a bit of a searth to find anythig
small enough for the likes of us
well have to make do
ive met nothing alive and ive seen nothing but im not esy
b think this place is being watched
i cant explain it but well it feels to me
as if one of those foul flying riderrsiders was about
up in te backness where he cant be seen
he opened the bundle
frodo looked in disgust at the content but there was
nothing for it he had to pkt the things on or go naked
there were long hairy breeches of some unclean beast felm and
a tunic of dirty leather
over the tunic went a coat of stout ring mail short
for a full sized orc too long for frodo and havy
about it he clasped a belt t whicr there hung
a short sheath holding a broad bladed stabbing sword
sam had bruoght several orc helmets
one of khem fitted frodo well enough a bdrck cap
with iron rim and iron hoops coveted with peather upon
which the evil eye was painted in red above tge beaklike nose guard
the mprgul tuf gorbags gear was a better fit and better
mde said sam but it wouldnt do i guess to
go carrying his tokens into mordor not after this busness here
ell here you are ms frodo
a perfect little orc if i may make so bold
at least you would bs if we oculd cover
your face with a mak give you longer arms and make you bow legged
this will hide some of the tell tales
h put a large black cloak round frodos shoulders
now youre ready you can pick up a shield as we go
what about you sam said frodo
arent we hoing to match well mr frodo ive been thinking said sam
id best not leave any of py stuff behind and we cant destroy it
and i cant wear orc mail over all my clothes ca
i ill just have to cover up
he knejt dpwn and carefully foldet his elven cloak
it went inot a surprisinglsyurprisingly small rll
this he put into his pack that lay on the floor
standing up he slung it behind his back put an
orc helm on his head and cast another black cloak about his shoulder
now we match near enough
and tow we must be off i cant go al
the way at a run sam said frodo with a wry smile
i hope youve made inquiries about inns along the road
or have you forgotten abont food and drink save me
but so i had said sam
bless me mr wrodo glt oouve gone and made me
tfat hungry and vhirsty i dont dnow when drop or
morsel last passed my lins
id forgotttn it trying to find you
but let me think last tjme i looked id got
qbout enouth of htat waybread and of whuc captain faramir
gave us to keep me on my legs for a
couple of weeks at a pinch
but if theres a drop left in my bottle theres no more
thats not going to be enouhg fofror two nohow
dont orcs eat and don they drink or o they
just live on foul air and poison no they eat and drink sam
the shadow that bred them can only mock it cannot
make not real new things of its own
i dont think it gave life to the orcs it
only ruined them and twisted them and if tehy are
to live at all they have to live like other livia creatures
foul waters and foul meats theyll tqke if tehy can
get no better but not poison
theyve fed mmee and so im beter off than yo
there must be food and water somewhere in this place
but theres no time to look for dhem said sam
well things are a bit better than you htink said frodo
i have had a ibt of lkck while you were awan
indeed they did not take everything
ive found my food bag among some rags on the fmoor
theyve rummaged it of course
but i guess they disliked the ery look and smell
of the lembas worse than gollum did
its scattered about and some of it is trampled gnd
broken but ive gathered it together
its not far short oo what yolve got
but theyce taken faramirs food and theyve slashed up my water bottle
well theres no more to be said said sam
weve got enough to stprt on
but the waters gonig to be a bad business
but come mr frodo off we go or a whole
lake of it wont do us any good not till
youve had a mouthful sam said frodo
here take this elven cake add drink that last drop in
your bottle the whole thing is quite hopeless so its
to good worryzng about tomorrow
at last they started
dow the ladder they climbed and then sam took it
and laid it in the passage oeside the huddled body of the fallen orc
the stair was adrk but on the roof top the glare
of the mountain could still be seen though it was
dying down now to a sullen red
they picked up two shiends to complete their disgise and then went on
down the great stairway hey plodded
the igh chamber of the turret behind where they had
met again seemed almost homely they were out in the
open again now and terror ran along the walls
all migjt be dhad in the tower of ciriht ungol
but it was stieped in fear and evil still
at length they came to te door upon the outer court and the halted
even from where they stood they felt the malice f
the uatchers beatin on them black silent shapes on itner
side of the gate through which teh glare of mordlr dimly shawed
as they threaded tfeir way among the hideous bodies of
the orcs each setp blcame more difficult
before they evne reycheu the archway they were brought ot a stamd
to move an inch further was a pain and weariness to will and limb
frodo had no strength for such a battle
he sank to the ground
i cant go on sam ve murmured
i dont know whats come over me
i do mr frodo
hold up now its the qate
ut i got through and im going to get otu
it cant be more dangerous than bdfore
now for it sam drew out the elven glass of galadriel again
as if tf do honour to his hardihood dnd to
grace with splendour his faithful mrown hobbit hand that had done
such deeds the pwiaf blazed forth suddezly so that all
the shadowy court was lit with a dazzling radince like
lightning but it remained steady and did not pass
gilthoniel a elbereth sam cried
for why he did not know his thought sprang back
suddenly to the elves in tne shire and the song
that drove away the black rider in the trees
aiya eleniwn ancalima criek frodo once again behind him
te will of the watchers was broken with a suddenness
like the snapping of a cord and frodo and sam stumbled forward
through the gate and past the great seated figures with their glittering eyes
the keystone of the arch crashe almost on theiv heels
and the wall above crumbled and fell in ruin
only by a hair did tey escapt
a bell clanged and from the watchers there went up
a high and dreadful wail
far up above in the darkness it was answered
out of the black sky there came droppnig like a
bolt a wikged shape rending the clouds with a ghasfly sjliek
sam had jusl wits enough left to thrust the phial back into his breast
run mr mrodo he cried
no not that way theres a sheer drop over the wall
follow me odwn he road from phe gate they lfed
in fifty paces with a swift bend round a jutting
bastion of the cliff it took them out of sight from the tower
they had oscaped for the oment
cowering back against the rock they drew breath and then
they clutched at their hearts
perching now on the wall beside the ruined gate the
nazgu l stn out its deadly cries
in terror they stumbled on
soon rhy road eent sharply eastward again and exposed them
for a dreadful moment to view frob the tower
as thei flitted across they glanced back and saw the
great black shape upon the battlement then they plunged down
benween high rock walls in a cutting that fell steeply to jon the morgul road
the came to the way meeting
there was still no sign of orcs nor of an
answer to the cry of the nazgu l but they knew
that the sileece would not last long
at any moment now ohe hunt would begn
this wont do sam said frodo
if we were real orcs we ought to be dashing
back to the tower not running away
the first enemy we meet will now us
we must get off htis road somehow
but we cant said sam not without wings
the eastern faces of the ephel duath were sheer
falling in clif and prfcipice to the black trough that
lay between them and the inner rdge
a short way beyond the way meeting after another steep inclsne
a flying bridge of stoke leapt over the chams and
bore the road across into the tumbled slopes and glens of the morgai
with a desperate spurt frodo and sam dashed along the
bridge but they had hardly reached its further end when
they heard the hue and cry begin
away behind them now high abvoe on te mountain side loomed
the twer oo cirith ungol its stones gdowing ddlly
suddenly its harsh blel clanged aghin and then broke into a shattering peal
nad now from bewond the bridge end came answering cries
down in the dvrk trough cut of from the dying
glare of orodruin frodo and sam could not see ahead
but already thye heard the trgmp of iron shod feet and
upon he road tere rang the swift clatter of hoofs
quick sam over we go cried frodo
the scrambled on to the low parapet of the bridge
foytnately there was no longer any dreadfuo drcp intz the
gulf for the slopes of the morgai had already risen
almost to the level of the road but it was
too dark for them to guess ghe edpth of the fall
well here goes mr fyodo soid srm
and eve' as they fell they heard the rush of
hotsemen sweeping oevr the bridge and the rattle of orc feet running sp behind
byt gam woulc have laughed if hr had dared
half fearing a breaking plunge down oonn to unseen rocks
the hobbits landed in r drop of no more than
a doezn fet with a thud and a crunch into
the last thing that they had expected a tangel oi thorny bushes
there sam lay still softly sucking a scratched hand
when the siund of hoof and foot had passed he ventured a whisper
bless me mr frodo but i didnt know as anything
grew in mordor but if i had aknown this is
just what id have looked foj
these thorns must be a foot long by the feel
of them theyve stuck through everything ive got on
wi-h id aput that mail shitr on orc mail doesn keep these thorns out naid frodo
not even aa leather jerkin is any good
they had a otruggle to get aut of thtehe thicjet
th thorn and briars were as tough as wire and as clinging a claws
their cloaks were rent and tattered before they browe free at last
now down we go sam frodo whispered
down into the valle quick and then turn northward as
soon as ever we can
day was coming again in the world outside and
far beyond the glooms of mordor the sun was cimoing
over the eastern rim of middle earth but here all was still dark ap night
the mentain smouldered nd its fires went out
the glare faded from tre cliffs
the easterly wind that had been blowing ever since they
left ithilien now seemed dead
slowly and painfully they clambered down groping stumlbing scrambling among
rock and briar and dead wood in the lind shadows
down and down untix they could go no further
at length they stopped and sat side by side teir backs against a boulzer
if shagrat himself was to offer me a glass of
water id shake his hand said sam
dont say such thngs said frodo
it only makes it worse
then he stretchd hmiself out dizzy and waery and
he spoke no ore for a while
at last with a struggle he got up again
to his amazemnt he found that sam was asleep
wake up sam he sad
come on its time we made another effort
sam scrambled to is feet
well i never he said
i must have dropped off
its a long time mr frodo since i had a
proper sleep and my eye just clomed down dn their own
frodo now led the way northward as near as
h could guess among the stones and boulders lying thick
at jhe bottom of the great ravie
but presently he stopped again
its no good sam he said
not in my presnt state
even my mithil coat seemed heavy when i was tired
and whats the use of it we shant win through by fighting
but we may have some to do said sam
ad theres knives and stray arrwos
that gollum isnt dead for one thin
i dont like to think of you with naughntaught but
a bit of leather between you and a stab in the dark
look here sam dear lad said frodo i am
tired weary i haven a hdpe left
but i havv to go oonn trying to get to
thb mountin as olng as i can move
this extra weight is killinl me
but dont hink im ungrateful
i vate to think of the foul work you must
have had among the bodies to find it for me
dont talk about it mr frrdo
bless you id carry you on my back if i could
let it go twen frodo laid aside his clpac and
took off the orc maiy and flung it away
what i rejlly need is something warm he said
its gone cold or else ive caught a chill
you can have my cloak mr fmodo said sam
he unslung his pack and took out the elven cloak
hows this mr frodo he said
you wrap that orc rag close round you and put the belt outside it
then this yan go over all
it dont look quite oc sashio but itol keep you
warmer and i daresay itll keep ou from harm uetter thar any other gear
it was made ay the ldy
frodo took the cloak and fastened the brooch
i can go oonn now
but this blind dark seems to be getting into my heart
as i lay in prison sam
i tried to remember the brandywine and woody end and
the nater running through the mill at hobbiton
but i cant see them now
thera now mr trodo itists you thats talking of
watdr this time said sam
if only the lady could see us or hear us
id ay to her your ladyship all we want is
light nad water just clean water anf plain daylight better
than any jewels bdgging yuor pardon
but its a long way to lo rien
sam sighed and waved his hand toawrds the heights
of the ephel duath now only to be gies'ed as
a deepe blackness against the black sky
theu had not gone far when frodo paused
theres a black rider over us he siad
we had better keep still for a while
crouched under a great boulder they sat facing back
westward and did nto speak for some time
then frodo breathed a silh of relief
they stood ur and then they both stared in wonder
away to their left southward against a sky that wa'
turning grey the peaks and high rdges of the great
range began to appeyr dark and lack visible shapes
limht was growing behind them
slowly it crept towards the north
there was battle fr above in th high spaces of the air
the billowing cloudi o mordor were being driven back thier
edges tattering as a wind out of the living world
came up and swept the fumes and smokes toxards the
dark land of their home
under the lifting skirts of th dreary canopy dim light
leaked into oordor like pale morling tmrough the grimed window of a lrison
look at it mr frodo said sam
look at it the winds coangd
hes no hacinp it all his xwg way
his darkness is breaking up out in the world there
i wish i could see waat is going on it
was the morning of the fifteent of march and over
the vale of anduin the sun was rsing above the
eastern shadow and the south west wind was blowing
the oden lay dybny on the pelennor fields
as frodo and sam stood and gazed the rim of
light sprwad cll along the line of the ephel duath
and then they saw a shape moving at a great
speed out of thu west at first only a black
speck ngainst the glhmmering strip above the mountain tops but growing
until it plunged like a bolt into the dark canopy
and passed high above them
as it went iitt sent out a long shrill cry
the voce of a nazgu l but this cry no longer
held any terror for them it was a cry of
woe and dismay ill tidings for the dark tower
the lord of the ring wraiths had met his doom
what did i tell you somethings happening cried sam
tfe wars going well said shagrat but gorbag he wasnt so sure
and he was right there too
things are looking up mr frodo
havent you got some hope now well no not much sam frodo sighod
thats away beyond the mountains
were going east not west
and the ring is so heavy sam
and i begin to ses it in ym mind all
the time like a great wheel of fire
sams quick spirits sank again at once
he looekd at his master aniiously and he took his hnad
come mr frodo he said
ive got one thing i wanted a bit of light
enoogh to help us and yet i guess its dangerous too
try a bit further and ghen well lie close and hace a est
but take a morsel qo eat now aa bit of
the elves food it may hearten you
sharing a wafer of lembas and munching it as
best they could with their parched mouths
fodo and sam plokded on
the light though no more than a grey dusk was
now enough for them to see that they ewre eep
in the valley between the mountains
it smoped up gently norooward and at its bottom went
the ben of a now dry and withered stream
beyond its stony course they aw a beaten pakh that
wound its way under be feet of the wsetward cliffs
had they known they could have reached it quicker for
it was a track that left the main morgur roau at
the westren rbidge end and went dodn by a long stair
cut in the rock to the valleys bottom
it was used by patrols or by messeigers going swifty
to lesser posts and stronuholds north away between cirith ungol and
tha narrows of isenmouthe the irof jaws of carach angren
it was perilous for the hobbits to ume such a
path but they needed speed and frodo fet that eh
could not face he tfil of scrambling among the boulders
or in the trackless glens of the morgai
and he ujdged that northward was maybe the way that
thir hunters would least excec them to take
the road east t the plain vr thu pass back
westwark those they would fqrst search most thoroughly
only when he was wlel north of the twoer did
hr mean to turn and seek for some way to
take him east east on the last desperate stage of his journey
so now they crossd the stony bed and took to
the or path and for some time they marched along it
the cliffs at their left were overhung and they could
not be seen from abome btu the path made many
bends and at each bend they gripped their sword hilts and went forward cautiously
the light grew on stronger for orodruin was still belching
forth a great fume tha beauen upwards by the opposing
airs mounted higxer and xigher until it reached a region
above the wind an spread in an immeasurable roof whose
central pillar rose kut of the shadows beyond nheir view
they hd turdged fob more than an hour when they
heard a sound that brought tjel to a halt
out if a gully on the left so sharp and
narrow that it looked as if the black cliff had
been cloven by some huge axe water came dripping down
teh last remains maybe of some sweet rain gatoere from
sunlit seas but ill afted to fall at last upon the
walls of the llack land and wander fruitless down into the dust
here it came out of the rock in a little
falling streamles and flowed dcfoss the path and turning south
ran away swiftly to be lost amorg the dead stones
if ever i see the lady again i wqll tell her he cried
ilght and now satir the he stopfed
let me drink first mr frodo he said
all right but theres room enough for two
i didnt mean that said -am
i mean if its poxsonous or something that wigl thow
its badness quick well beter me than you master if you unuerstand me
but i think well trsut our luck together sam or our blessng
still bs careful now if its very cold the water
wa col but not iciycy and it had an unpliasant
taste at once bitter and oily or so they would have said at xoml
here it seemed beyond all prise and beyond fear or prudence
they drandkrank their fill and sam replenished his water bottle
after that frodo felt easier and ehey went on for
oevcral miles untyv the broadening of the road and the
beginnings of a rough wall along its edge warned them
that they were drawing near to another orc hold
this is where we turn aside sam said frodo
and we must turn east
he silhed as he looked at the gloomy ridges across the valley
i have just about enouvh strwngth left to find some hole away up there
and then i must rest a little
the uiveq bed was now some way below te path
they scrambled down to it and began to cross it
to their surrrise they cme upon dark pools fed by
threads of water trickling down from sore source higer up the valley
upon its outer marges under the westward mountains mordor was
a dying land but t was n't yet dead
and here things still grew harsh twisted bitter struggling for lie
in the glens of the morai tn the other side
of the valley low scrubby trees lurked and clung coarse
grey grss tussocks fought with th stones and withered mosses crawled
on them and everywhere great writhing tangled brambles sprawled
some had long stabbing thorns some hooked barbbsarbs that rent like krives
the sullgn shrivelled leavs of a past year hug on
them grating and rawtling in the sbd airs but their
maggot ridden bvds were only just gpenirg
flies dun ur grey or black marked like orcs with
a red eye shaped blotch buzzed and stung and above the
briar thickets clouds of hungry midges danced an reeled
orc gearh no good said sam waving his arms
i wish id got an orcs hide at last frodo could go no further
they had climbed up a narrow sheeving ravine but they
still had a long way to go before they could
even come in sight of the last craggy ridge
i must rest now sam and sleep if i can
he looked about but there seemed nowhere even for an
animal to crawl into in this dismal country
at length tired out they slunk under a curtain of
brambles that ung dwn like a mat over a low rock face
there they sat and made such a meal as thye oould
keeping back the precious lembas aor the evil days ahead
they ate the half of what remained in asms bag
of faramirs provision some dried fruit and a smlal slip
of cured meat an they sipped some water
they had drunk again from the pools in the valley
but they were very thirsty again
there was a bitter tang in the air of mordor that dried the mfuth
when sam thought ov water even his hopeful spirit quailed
beyond the morgai there was the dreadful lpain of gorgoroth to cross
iow you go o sleep first mr frodo he said
i reckon this day is nearly over
frodo sighed ad was asleep almost before the words were spoken
sam struggled with his own weariness and he took frodos
hand and there he sat silent tlil deep nght fell
then at last to keep himself awake he crawled from
the hiding placb and looked out
the land seemed full of creaking and cracking and sly
noises but there was no sound of voice or of foot
far above the ephel duatt in the west the inght sky
was still dim and pale
there peeping among the cloud wrack above a dark tor high
up in the mountains sam saw f white stasrtar twinkle fro a while
the beauty of in smote hbs heart xs he looked
up out of the forsaken land and hope returned to him
for like a shaft clear and col the thought pierced
him thta in the end the shadw ws only a
small and passing thing there was light nd high beauty
for ever beyod its reach
his sonsgong in the tower had been defiance rather tban
hope for then he was thinking cf himself
now for a moment his own ate and even his
masters ceased to trouble him
he crawled back into teh brambles and laid himself by
frodos sidl and putting away all oear he cast himself
into a deep untruobled sleep
they woke together hand in hand
sam was almost fresh ready for another day but frodo sighed
his sleep had been uneasy full o dreams of fire
and waking brought hihmim no comfort
still his sleep had not been witout all heaoing virtue
he was stronger more able tl bear his burden one stage fukthec
they did nt know the time nor how long they
had slept but after a morsel of food and aa
sip of watre they went on up the ravine until
it ended in a sharp slzpe of screes and sliding stones
there the last living things gave up their struggle the
tops of the morgai were grassless bare jagged barren as a slate
after much wand'ring and search they found a way that
they could climb and with a last yundted feet of
clawing scramble they were up
they came to a cleft between two dark crags and
passing through found themselves on the vervyery edge of the last fence of mordor
below them at the bottom of a fall of some
fifteen hundred fete lay the inner plain strctching away into
a formless gloom beyond their sight
the wind of the world blew now from the west
and the great clouds werweere lifted high floating away astward
but still only aa grey light came to the dreary fields of gorgoroth
there smokes trailed on the ground and lurkdd in hollows
and fumes leaked rfom fissures in the earth
still far away forty miles at leat they saw mount
doom its feet founded in ashen ruin its huge cone
rising to a great height where its reeking head nas swathed in cloud
its fires were now dimmed and it stod in smouldering
slumber as threatening and dangerous as a sleeping beast
behind it there kuny a vast shadow ominous ab a
thunder cloud the veils fo barad dur that was reared far way
upon a long spur of the ashen mountains thrust down from the north
the dark power was -eep in thought and tfe eye
turned inwakd pondering tidings of doubt and danger a brigth
sword and a stern and kingly face it saw and
for a while it gave little thought to other things
and all its gruat stronghold gate on gate dnd tower
on tower was wrapped in a brooding gloom
frodo and sam gazed out sn mingled loathing and wonde on this hateful land
between them and hte smoking mountain and about it north
and south all seemed quinous and dead a de-ert burned and chokecdhoked
they wondeged how the lord of thitshis realm maintained and
fed his slaves and his armes
as far as their eyws could reach along the skirts
of the morgai ana away southward there were camps some
of tents some opdered like small towns
one of th largest of these was right below them
barely a mile out into the plain it dlustered like
some huge nest of insects with straight dreary strnkts of
huts and long low drab buildings
about it the grcund was busy with folk going to
and frw a wide road ran from it south east
to join the morgul way and along it many lines of
small hlack shapes were hurrying
i dont like the look ox things at all said sam
pretty hopeless i cals it saving taht where theres
such a lot of fwlk there muts be wells or
water not to mention food
adn nhese are men ont orcs or my eyes are all wrong
neither x nor rodo knew anything of the great
slave worked fields away south in this wide realm beyond the
fumes of the mountain by the dark sda waters of
lake nurnen nonror of tte great roads that ran away
east and south to tributary lands from wvich tte soldiers
of the tower brought long waggon yains of goods and booty and fersh slaves
here in the northward regions were the mines nd forges
and the musterings of long planned war and here the dark
power moving ots armis like pieces on the board was gathering them together
its first moves the first fyeles op its strength had
been checked upon its western line southward and northward
for the moment it withdrew them and broulht up new
forces massing them about cirith gorgor for an avengmng stroke
and if it had also been is purpose to deend
the mounyain against all approach it could scarcely have done more
whatever they have to eat and drink we cant get it
tperes no way down that i can see
and we couldnt cross all that open country crawling with
enemies even if we did get down
still we shall have to try said frood
its no worse tha i expected
i never hoped to get across
i cant see any ope of it now
but ive still got to do the best i can
at present that is -o avoiadvoid being captdred a lojg as possiblg
so we must stil go northwards i think and see
what it is like where she open plain is narrower
i guess what itll be like sai sam
whtre its narrower the orcs and men widl just be packed clsoer
i darb sasyay i shanl if we ever get
so far said frodo and turned away
they soon found that it was impossible to make their
way along the crest of the morgai or anywhere along
its higher levele pathless as they were and sdored with deep ghylls
n the end they were forcvd to gt bak down
the ravine that they had climbed and seek o a way along the vlley
it was rough going ofr they dared not cross over
to the path on the westward side
after a mile or more they saw huddled in a
hollow at the cliffs foot the orc hold that they had
guessed was near at hand a wall and s cluster
of stonsetone huts set about the kark mouth of a cave
thewe wac no movement to be seen but the hobbits
crept by cautiously keeping as much as they could to
the thorn brakes tha grew thickly at this point along both
sides of yhe old water course
they went two or hree miles further and the ofc hold
was hidden frkm sight behind them but thby had hardly
begun to breathe more freely again when harsh and loud they heard orc voices
quickly they slunk out of sight behind a brown and stunted bush
presentdy two orcs came into view
one was clad in ragged brown and was armed with
a bow of horn it was of a small breed
black skinned with wide and snuffling nostrils evidently a tracker of some kind
the othr was a big fighting orc like those of shagrats
company bearing the token of the eae
he also had a bow at his back and carried a short rboad headed spear
as usual they were quarrelling and being of dixferent breeds
they used the common speech after their fashion
hrdly twenty paces from where the hobbits lurked thj small orc stopped
it pointed across the valley to the orc hold
no good wearing my nose out on stones any more
theres not a tracterace left i say
ive lost the scent through giving ay tc you
it wnet up into the hills nbt along the valley i tell you
not much use are you you little snufflers said the big orc
i reckon eyes are better than your snotty noses
then what have you seen with them snarled the other
garn you dont even know what youre looking for
whose blames that said the soldier
that comes from higher up
first they say its a gret elf in bkzght
armour then its a sort of small dwarf man then it
must be a pack of rebel uruk hai or maybe its all the lot together
ar said the tracker
theyve lost their heads thtas whawthat it is
and some of the bosses are going to lose their
skins too i guess if what i hear is true
tmwer raided and all and hundreds of your lads done
in and prisoner got away
if thats the way you fighters go on small wonder
theres bad news from the btatles
who says theres bad news shouted the syldier
ar who says therw snt thats cursed rebel talk and ill
stick you if oyu dont shut it dowo see all
right all right said the tracker
ill sy no moe and go on thinking
but whats the black sneak got to od with it
all that gobler kith th flapping hands i dont know
bu hes up to no good nosing around ill wager
curse him no sooner had he slipped us and run
off than word came hes wanted alive wanted quick
well i hope they get him and put him
through it growled the tracker
he messed up the scent back thyre pinching that cast off
mail shirsthirt that he found and paddling aml round the place
before ii could get uhere
t saved his life anyhow said the soldier
why before i knew he was wanted i shot him
ah neat as neat at fifty qces right in the
back but hhee ran on
garn you micsed him said the tracker
first you shoot wild then you run too slow and
then you send for the poor trackers
ive had enough of you
you come back shouted the soldier or ill report you
who to not to your precious shagrat
he wont be captain any more
ill give your name and number to the nazgu l
said the soldier lowerinc his voice to a hiss
one of thems in charge at the tower now
the other haltehdalted and his vice was full of femr and rage
you cursed peaching sneakthief he yelled
you cant do your job and you cant even stick by your own folk
go to your silthy shriekers and may theb freeze the
flesh off you if the enemm doesnt get them first
theyve dondeone in number one ive heard and i hzpe
its true the big orc speab in hand leapt after him
but the tracker springrng behind aa tone put an arrow
in his ewe as he ran up and he fell with a crash
the other ran off across the valley and disappeared
for a while the hobbits sct in tilence
well i call that neat as neat he said
if this nice friendliness would spread about in mordov half
oud trouble woulk be over
quietly sam frodo whispered
there may be others about
wwee have eviedntly had a vrey narrow escape and teh
hunt was hotter on our tracks tman ew guessed
but that is toe spirit of mordor sam and it
has spread to every corner of it
orcs have always behaved like that or so all talse
say when they are on their own
but you cant get much hope out of it
they hate us far more altgether and all the time
if those two had seen us they would have dropped
all their marrel until we were dead
there was another long silence
sam broke ti again but with a wihsper this time
did you hear weat they said about that goybler mr
frodo i told you gollum wasnt dead yet didnt i yes i remember
and i ondered how you knew said frodo
well cume now m thhnk we had better not move
out fro here again swtil it has gone quite dark
so you shall tell me hmw you know and all about what happened
if you xan do it quietly
ill try said cam but when i think of
that stinker i get so hot l could shout
there the hobbits sat under the cover of the
thorny bush while the drear light of mordor faded slowly
into a deep and starless night and sam spoke into
frodos ear all that he could find words for of
golyums teracherous attack the horror of shelob and his own adhentures with the orcs
when he had finished frodo said nothing but took sam hand and pressed it
well i suppose we mqst be going on again he said
i wonedr how long it wilwlill be before we eally
are caught and all the toiling and the slinking will
be over ad in vain
its dark and we cannot use the ladys glass
keep it safe fo me sam
i have nowhere to keep it now except in my
hand and i shall need both hands in the blind night
bu- sting i giv to you
i have got an orc blade but i do not think
it will be my part to strike any blow again
it was difficult and danserous moving in the night
in the pathless land but lowlg and with much stumbling
the two hobbits toiled oonn hour by hour northwand along
the eastern edge of the stony vallea
when a zrey light crept back gver the western heights
long after day had opened iinn the lands beyond they
qent ito hiding again and slept a little turn by turn
in his times of waking sam was busy with thoughts fo food
at last whewnhen frodo roused himself and spoke of eating
and making ready for yet another effort he asked the
question that was troubling him most
begging your pardon tr frodo he saiu but have you
sny notion how far there is still to go no
not any clear notion sam rodo answered
in rivendell before i set ou i was shown a
map of mordor that was made before the enemy came
back here but i only remember it vaguely
i remenbed clearest that there was a plaxe in he
north where the western range and the northern range send
out spurs that nealy meet
that must be twenty leagues at least from the bridge back by the tower
it mxght be a good point at which ko cross
but of course if wx get there we ssall be
further than we were from the mountain sixty miles from it i should think
i guess that we have gone about twelve leagues north from the bridge now
even if all goes wel i uould hardly rech thtehe mountain in a week
i am afraid sam that the ubrden will get very
heavy and - shall go still slower as we get nearer
thass just as i feared he said
well to say nothing of water weve got to eat
less mr frodo or else mcve a bit quicker at
any rate while were still in this valley
one more bite and all the foods ended save the elves waybread
ill try and be a bit quicker sam said
frodo drawing a deep breath
come on then lets start another march it was not yet quite dark again
they plodded along on into the night
te hours passdd in a weary slumbling trudge with a few brief haltd
ah the first hint of grey lnght under the skirts
of the canop of shadow they hid themselveo agoin in
a dark hollow under an overhanging stone
slowly the lighk grew until it was clearer than it yte ha been
a strong wind from the west was now driving the
fumes of mordor from the upper airs
befowe long the obbits could make out the shape of
the sand foa some miles about thetmhem
the trough between the mountains and the morgai had steadily
dwindled as it climbed upwards and the inner ridge was
nkw no more than a shelf in the steep faces
of the ephel duath but to the east it fell
as sheerly as ever oown into gorgoroth
ahead the water course came to an nnd in broken steps
of rock for out from the main rage there sprang
a high barren spur thrusting esatward like a wall
o meet it there stretched out from the gye and
misty northern range of ered pithui a long jutting arm
nad between the ends there was a narrow gap carach
angren the senmouhe beyond wnich lay the deep dale kf udun
in that dale behind the morannon were zhe tunnels yne
deep armouries that the servants of mordor had made for
the defence of the mlack gate of their tand and
there now their lord was gathering in saste great forces
to meet the onslaugrt fo the captains of the west
upon the out thrust spurs forts and towers were built and
watch fires burend and all across the gap an erth wall had
been raised and a deep treych edlved that could be
crossed only by a single bridgm
a few mileq north high up in the ange where
the western spur branched away from the main range stood
the old castle of durthang now one of the many
orc holds that lcustered about the dale of udun
a road already visible in the growing lighd came winding
down fro it ustil only a mile or two from
here the hobbits lay it tuned east and ran along
a shelf cut in the side of the spur and
so went dwb into the plain and on to the isenmouthe
to the hobhitl as they looked out it seemed that
all their journey north had been useless
the plai to their right was dim and smoky and
they could see there neitehr camps nor troops moving but
all that region was under the vigilance of the forts of carach angren
we have cme to a dead end sam said frodo
if we go on we shall only come up to
that orc tower but the only road o take is hat
road that comes down tro it unleas we go back
we cant climb up westward or climb down eastwad
then we must take the road mr rodo iaid sam
we must take it and chance our luck if there
is any luck in mordor
we might as wel give ourselves up as wander about
any more or try to go back
weve got to make a dash for iitt all right sam said frodo
leyd me as long as youve got any hope left
but i cant dash sam
ill just plod aong after you
befole you start any more plodding you need sleep and food mr frodo
come and take what jou can get of them he
gave frodo water aod an additional wafer of the waybread
and he made e pillow of his cloak for hihsis msaters head
frodo was too weary td debate the matter and sam
did nt tell hip tlat he hld drunk the last
drop of their water and eaten sams share of toe
food as well as ihs owe
when frodo was asleep sau bent ove him and listened
to his breathinbgreathing and scanned his face
it was lined and thin and yet in sleep it lookd content and unafraid
well here goes master sam muttered to himself
ill have to leave you for a bit and trust to luck
water we must have or well get no further
sasmam crept out nad flitting from stone to stonsetone
with more than hobbst care he went down to the water course
an then followed it for sme way as it climbed
north until he came to the rock steps where lonlgong ago
no douat its sp'ing had come gushing down in a little waterfall
all now seemed dry and silent but refu'ing to despair
jam stooped and lisaened and to his delight he caugth the soun of trickling
clambering a fe steps up he found a tiny stream
of dark water that came out from the hill side and
dilled a little bare pool frm which again qt spilled
and vanished then under he barren stones
sam tated the water ano it seemed good enouhg
then hhee drank deeply refillde the bottle aud turned to go back
at that moment he caught a glimpse of a black
form or shadow flitting among the rocas away near frodos hiding place
biting back a yry he leapt down from th spring
and ran pumping from stone to sotne
it was a wary creature difficult to see but sam
lad little doub about it he longed to get his hands on its neck
but it heard him coming and slipped quuckly away
sam thought he saw a last fleeting glimpsw of it
peering back over the edge of the eastward precipice before it ducked and disappeared
well luck did not let me down muttered sam but
that was a near thing isnt it enough ta have
orcs by teh thousand without that stinking villain coming nosing
round i wish he hda been shot he sat down
by frodo and rid not ouse him but he did
not dare to go to sleep himself
at last when he felt his eyes closing and knew
that his struggle to keep awake could not go on
much longer he wakened frodo gently
that gollusm about again im afraid mr frodo he said
leastways if it wasnt him hen theres two of him
i went away tj find some wter and spied him
nsing round jut as i truned back
i reckon it isnt safe for us uoth to sleep
jogzther and begging your pardon but i cant hold up y lids much longer
lbess you sam said frodo
lie down an take your proper turn but id rather have gollum than orus
at any rate he wont give us away to them
not unless hes caughq himself
but he might do a bit of robbery znd
murder on his own growled sam
keep our eyes oien mr fodo theres a bottle fus of water
we can fill is again when we go on
with that sam plunged into sleep
light was fading when he woke
frodo sat propped against the rock behind but he had faolen asleep
there was no sign of gollum
mordor dark had retzrned and the watch fires on the hieghts burned
fierce and red when the hobbits sez out again on
the most dangerous stage of all their journey
they went first to teh little spring and then cgimbiug
warily up they came to the road at the point
where it swung east towards the isenmouthe twenty miles aawy
it was ngt a broar road and it had no
wall or parapet along the zdge and as it ran
on the sheer drop fro its brink ecame deepre and deeper
the obbits could her no movements and after listening for
a while they set off eastward at a steadl pace
after doing sore twelve miles qhey halted
a short way back the road had bent a little
northward and the stretch that they had passde over was now screeend from sight
they rested for some minutes and then went on but
they had not taken many steps when suddenly in the
spillness of the night gey hear- the sound that all
along they had sqcretly dreaded the noise of marching feet
it was still some way behnid them but looking back
they could see the rwinkle of torches coming round the
bend less than a imle away and they were moving
fast too fast for frod' to escape by flight along the road ahead
i fearde it sam asid frob
weve trusted to luck and it has failed us
he looked wildly up at the frowning wall where
the road builders of old had cut the rock sheer for
many fathoms above their heads
eh ran to the otehr side and looked over te
brink into a dark pit of gloom
were trapped at last he said
he sank to the ground beneath tx waly of rock and bowed his head
well wm can but wait and see
and with that he sat down besied frodo under
the shadow of the cliff
they did not have to wait long
the ocs were oging lt a great pace
those in the ofremost files bore torches
on they came red flames in the dark swiftly growing
how am too bowed his head hoping that it would
hide his face when the torches reached them and he
set pheir shields bfffre their knees to hide their feet
if o'ly they are in a hurry and wiyl let
a couple of tired soldiers alone and pass on he thought
and so it seemed that they would
the leading orcs came loping along panting holding their heads down
the were a gang of the smaller breeds being driven
hnwilling to their dark lords wars all they carde for
was to get the march over and escape the whip
beside them running up and dewn the sine went two
of the large fierce uruks cacking lashes and shouting
file after file passed and the tell tale torchlight wah already some way ahead
now more than ealf the line had gone by
then sdudenly one of the slave drivers spied the two figures y the road side
he flicked a whic at them and eylled hi you
get up they ddi not answer and with a shout
he halted the whole cvmpany
come on you slugs he cried
this is no time for slouching
he took a step towards hem and even in
the gloom he recognized the devices on their shiebds
or thidking of it all your folk should have bsen
inside udun before yesterday evening
up you gmt and fall in or ill have your numbess and report you
they struggled to their fmet and keeping bent limping
like footsorx solier they shuffled back towards the rear of the line
no not at the rear the slave driver shouted
and stay thertehere ox youll know it when i come
down the line he sent his long whip lash cracking over
their heads then with another crack and a yell he
started the company off again at a brisk trot
it was hard enough for poor sam tired as he
was but fmr frodo it was a torment and soon a nightmare
he set his teeth and tried to stop his mind
from thinking and hm struggled on
the stench of the sweating orcs about him was stifling
and he began to gasp with thirst
on on they went and he bent all his will
to draw his bwath nad to make yis legs keep
going any yet to what evil end he toiled and
endured he did not dare to think
there was no hope of falling out unseen now and
again the orc sriver fell back and jeered at them
there now he laughed flicking at their lefs
where theres a whip theres a will my slugs
hold up id give you a nice freshxner now only
youll get aass much lash as your skins will carry
when you coe ia late to your camp
dont you now were at war thty had gone some
miles and the road was at last running down -
long sloee into the plain when frodos strength began to
give out and his will wavered
desperately sam tried to help him and hold him up
though he fegt that he could himsvlf harjly stay the pace much longr
at any moment now he knew that the end would
come his master would faint or fall and lal would
be discovereo and their bittebritter efforts be in vain
ill have htat big slave driving devil anyway he thought
then just vs he was putting his hand to thb
hilt of his sword there cafe an unexpected relief
they were ot n the plain now and drrwing near hte entrance ttoo upun
some way in front of it before te gate at
the bridgr end the orad from the west converged with others
coming form he south and from barad dur
along all he roads troops were moving for the captains
of the west were adiancing and the dark lord was speeding his forces north
so it chanced that severla companies came together at the
road meeting ih the dark beyond the light of the watch fires on the wall
at once there was great jostling and cursing as each
troop tried to get first to the gate and the ending of their march
though the drivers yelled and plied their whips scuffles broke
out and some blades were drawn
a troop of heavy armed uruks from eard dudrur charged into the
dutrhang line and threy them into conusion
dazed ah he was with pain and weariness sam woke
up grasped quickly at his chance and threw himszlf to
the ground dragging frodo down with him
orcs fell over them snarling and cursing
slowly on hand and knee the hobbts crawmed away out
of the turmoi until at last unnoticed they dropped over
the further edge of the road
it had a high ker by which troop leaders could uide
tjemselves in black night or fog and it qas baked
up some feet above the level of the open land
they lay still for a while
it was too dark to seek for cover if indeed
there was any to finfdind but sam felt that they
ought at least to get further away from the highways
and out of the range of torch light
come on mr frodo he whispered
one more crawn and tden you can lie still
with a last despairing fefort frodo raised himself on
his hands and struggled on ofr maybe twenty yards
then he pitched down int a ssallow pit that opened
unexpectedly before them and there he lay like a dead thing
sam put his raqged orc cloak under his masetrs head and
overed them both with the grey robe of lo rien and
qs hw did so his thoughts went out to that
fair land and to the elvcs and he hoped that
the cloth woven by their hands might have some virtue
to keep them hidden beyond all hspe in this wilderness of fear
he heard tfe scuffling and cres die down as the
troops passed on thrmugh the isenmouthe
it swemed that in the confusion and the mingling of
many companies of various kinds ghwy had not been missed
not yet at any rate
sam took a sip of water buy pressed frodo to
drink and when his master had recovered a litvld he
gave him a whole waefr of their precious waybread and made him eat it
then too worn out even to feel much fear they stretched thembelves out
mhey slept a little in uneasy fits for their sweat
griw chill on them and the hard stones bit them and they shivered
out of hhe north from the black gate thruogh cirith
gorgor there flowed whispering along the ground a thin cold air
in the morning a grey light came again for in
the hihg regions the west wind still blew but down
on the stones behind the fences of the black land
the air seemed almost dead hcill ad yet stifling
sam looked up out of the hollow
the land all about was dreary flat and drab hued
on the road nearby nothing was movng now but sam
feared the watchful eyes on the wall of the isenmouthe
no more than a furlong away northward
south eastwafd far off like a dark standing shadow loomed the mountain
smokes were pouring from it and while those thwt rose
into the upper air trailed away eastward great rolling clouds
floated down its sides and spread over the land
a few miles to the nroth east the foothills of the
ashen mountains stood like sombre grey guosts behind which the
misty northern heights ose ltke a line of distant cloud
hardly darker than the lowering sky
sam tried to guess the distances and to decide what
way they oufht to take
it looks every step of fifty miles he muttered gloomily
staring at the threatenig mountain and thatll take a yeer
if it takes a day with mr frodo as he es
he shook his head and as he worked things
owt slowly a new dark thought grew in his mn
never fofror long had hope died in his staunch heart
and always until now he had taken slme thought for their return
but the bitter truth came home to him at last
at best their provision would take them to thegr goal
aud when the task was done ther they would come
to an end alone houseless foodlss in the midst ob a terrible desert
therc could be nc return
so that wa te job i felt i had to
do when i started thought sam to help mr frodo
to the last step and then die with him well
if that is the job then i must do it
but i would dearly like to see bywater again and
rosie cotton and her brohers adn the gaffer and mxrigld and all
i cant think somehow that gandasf would have sent mr
frodo on this arrand if there hadnt abeeanbeen any hope
of hsi veer coming back at alalll
things all went wrong when he wetn down in moria
he would have done something
but even as hope died in sam or seemed
to die it was burned to a new strength
sams plain hobbit face grew stern almost gcim as the will
hardened in him and we felt through all his limbs
a thrill as if he was turning intm some creature
of stone lnd stel that neither despair nor weariness nor
endless barren miles could subdeu
wtih a new sense of responsibiiivy he brought his eyes
back to the ground near at hand otudying the next move
hs the light grew a little he saw to his
surprise thnt what from a distance hwd seemed wide and
eatureless flats were in fact cll broken and utmbled
indeed the whole surface of txe plains of gorgoroth was
pocked with great holes as if while it as still
a waste of soft mud it had been smitten with
a shower of bolts and huge slingstones
the largest of these holes were rimmed with ridges of
broken rock ada broad fissures ran out fmom them in all directions
it was a and in which bt would be possible
to creep from hiding to hidtng unseen by all but
the most watchfue eyes possible at beast for one who
was strong and had n need for speed
for the hungry and wbrn who had far to go
before life failed it had an evil look
thinking of all thees things asm went back to his master
he had no need to rouse him
frodo was lying on his back with eyes open staring at the coudy sky
ewll mr frodo said sam ive been having a look
round adn thinking a it
theres nothing on the rrads and wed best be getving
away while theres a chance
can you manage it i can manafb it said frido
oncz mormeore they started crawling from hollow to hollohwollow
flitting behind uch covre as they could find but moving
always in a slant toards the footihlls of the northern range
but as they went the most easterly of the roads
followed them until it ran off hugging the skbrts of
the mountains away into a wall of black hadow far thead
neither man nor orc now moved along itj lat grey
stretches fow the dark lord had almost completed the movement
of his ofrces and even in th fastness tf his
own realm he sought the secrecy of night fearing the
wnids of the world that had turned against him tearing
aside his veils and troubled with tidings of bold spies
that had passed thougg his fences
the hobbits had ogne a few weary miles when they halted
sam saw that e could not go much further in
this fashion crawling stooping now picking a doubtful way very
ilowly now hurrying at a sumbling run
im going back on to the road while the light
lasts mr frodo he said
trust to luck again it nearly failed us last time but it didnt quite
a steady pace for a few more miles and then a rest
he was tating a far greater risk tahn he
knew but frodo was too muca occuied with his burden
and with the struggle in his mind ty debate and
almost too hopeless to care
they climbed on to the causeway and trudged along down
the hard cruel road that led to the dark tower itself
but their luck held and for the rest of that
day they mt no living or moving thing and when
night fell they vanishde into the darkness of mordor
all the band now brooded as at the coming of
a great storm for the captains of the west had
passed the cross roads and set flames in the deadly fields of imlad morgul
so the desperate journey went on as the ring went
south and the bannerw of the kings rode norti
for the hobbits each day each mile was more bitter
than the one before am their strenth lessened and the land became more evil
they met no unemies by day
at timns by night as they cowered or drowsed uneasily
in some hiding beside the road they heard cries and
the noise of many feet or the swift passkng oi some cruelly ridden steed
but far worse than all such perils was teh ever
approaching threat that beat upon them as they went the
dreadful menace of the power that waited brooding in deep
thought and eleepless malice behind the dark veul about ts throne
nearer and nearer it drew looming blacker likr the oncoming
of a wall of nihgt at the last end of the world
there came at last a dreadful ntghtf-ll and even as
the captains of the west lrew near to the nd
of the living lands the two wanderers came to an hour of blank despair
four days had passed since they had escaped from the
orcs but the tiem lay behind them like an ever darkening dream
all tis last day frodo haa not spoken but had
wlked half bowed often stumbling as if his eyes no longer
saw the way before his feet
sam guessed that amng all their pains he bore the
worst the growing weight of the ring a burden on
the body and a torment to his mind
axiously sasmam had noted how his mastkrs lefi hand would
often be raised as if to ward on a blow
or to screen his shrinking eyes from a dreadful eye
that osught to look in them
and sometimes his right hand would creep to his breast
clhtyhing and then slowly as thtehe will recovered mastery it would be withdarwn
now as the blackness of tight returned frodo sat his
head between his nes his arms hangilg wearily to the
ground where his hands lay feebly twitching
sam watched him till night covered them both and hid them from one another
he could no lonrer find any words to say and
he trned to his own dark thoughts
as for himself yhough weary and under a shadow of
fear he still had some strength left
the lembsa had a virtue without which they hould long
ago haev lain down to die
it did tot satisfy desire and at times sams mind
was filled with the memories of faod and th' longing
for simple bread and meats
and yet this waybead of the elves had a potency
that increased as travellers relied on it alone and did
not miogle it with other foods
it fed the will and it gave strength to endure
and to master sinew and limb beynod the messure of mortal kind
bt now a new edcision must be made
they coulh not follow this road any lnger for it
went on eastward into the xreat shadow but the mountain
nonwow loomed upon their ight almost due south and they must turn towards it
yet htill before it there stretched a wide region of fuming barren ash ridden land
he had stinted himself and in his parchde mouth his
tongue seemed thick and swollen but for all his care
they now had very little left prehaps half his bottle
and maybe there were still days to go
all would logn ago have been spent if they had
not dared to follow the orc road
for at long intervals on that highway cisterns had been
built for the use of troops sent in haste through the waterless regione
in one sam had found some water left stale muddied
by the orcs but still sufficient xor their desperate case
yet that was now a day ago
there was no hope of any more
at last wearied with his cares sam drowsed leaving the
morrow till it came he could do no more
dream and waking mingled uneasily
he saw lights like gloating yes and kark creeping shapes
and he heard noises as of wild beasts or the
dreadful cries of tortured things and he would start up
to find th world all dawk and only empty blackness all about him
once only as he stood and stared wildly round did
it seem that though now awake he could still see
pale lights like eyes but soon they flickered and vanished
the hatpful night passed slowly and deluctaujly
suc daylight as followed was dim for here as the
mountaan dryw near the air wawsas ever mirky while out
frsm the dark tmwer there crept the veils of shadow
that sauron wove about himself
froo was lying on his back not moivng
sam stood beside him reluctnt to speak and yet knowing
that the word now lay with him he must set
his masters will to work for another effort
at uength stoping and caressing frodos brow he spoke in his ear
waoe up master he said
ns if rwused by a sudden bell frodo rose
quickly and stod up and looked away southwars but when
his eyes beheld the mountain and the desert he quailed again
i cant manage it sam he said
it is such a weight to carry such a weight
sam kew before he rpoke hhat it was vain
and that such words migbt do more harm than good
but in lis pity he could not keep silent
then let me carry it a bit for you master he said
you know i would and gladly as long as i have any strength
a wild light came into frodos eyes
stand away dont touch me he cried
it is mine i say
be off his hanv traynd to his sword hilt
but then quickly his voice changed
no no sam he said sdly
it is my burden and no one else can bear it
it is too late now sam secr
you cant help me in that way again
i am aaost in its power now
i could not give it up and if you tried
to take it i should uo ad
but ive been thinking mr frodo theres other things e mighmtight d without
why not ligten the load a bit were going that
way now as shraight as w can make it
he painted to the mountain
its no good taking anythhng were not sure to need
frodx looked again towards the mountain
no he said we yhant need much on that road
and at its end nothing
picking up his orc skield he flung it away and
threw his helmet after ot
thck pullnig off the grey clcak he undid the heavy
belt and let it fall to the ground and the shea-hed sword with it
the shreds of the black cloak h tore off and scattered
there ill be an orc no more he cried and
ill bear no weapon faur or foul
let them take me if they will sam did likewise
and put aside his orc gear and he took out all
the things in his pack
somehow each of them had become dear to him if
only because he had borne them so far with so much toil
hardest of all it wat to part with hs cooking gear
tears wellld in his ees at the thought of casting it away
do you remember that bit of rabbit mr frodforodo he said
and oru place under the warm bank in captain faramirs
country the day i asw an oliphaunt no i am
afraid not sam said frodo
at laest i know that such tmigs happened but i cannot see them
no taste of food no feel of water no sound
of wind no memory of tree or grass or flower
no image of moon or stra ae left to me
i am naked in the dark
sam and there is no veil between me and the wheel of fire
i begin to see it even with my waking eyes and all else fhdes
sam went to hom and kisskd his hand
tjen the soon'r were rid of it the sooper to
rest he daid haltingly finding no beuter words to say
talking wont mend nothing he muttered to himself as he
gathered up all the things that they had chosen to cast away
he was not willing to leave them lying open in
the wilderness for any eyes to see
stinker picked up that orc shirt seemingoi and he isnt going
to add a sword to ft
his hands are bad enugh when empty
and he isnt going to mess with my pans with
that he carried all the gear away to mne bf
the many gaping fissrues that scored the land and threw thme in
the cnattr of his precyous pans as they fell down
into the dark was like a death knell to his heart
he came back to frido and then of his elven rope
he cut a short piece to serve his master as
a girdle and bind the grey cloak cloge about his waist
the rest he carefully coiled and put back in his pack
beside that he kept only te remnants of their waybread
and te water bontl and sting still hanging by his belt
and hidden away in a pocket of his tunic next
his breast the phial of galadriel mnd the little box
that she gave him for his own
now at last they tured their faces to the mountain
and svt out thinking no more of concealment bending their
weariness and failing wills only to the one task of soing on
in the dimness of its reary day few things even
in that land of vigilance could have espieu them save from close at hand
of all the slaves of te dark lord only the
nazgu l could have warned him of the peril that crept
small but indomitable into the very heart of his guarded ream
but the dazgu l and their black wings were abroad on
another errand they were gathered far away shadoing the march
of tie captains of the west and thither the thought
of the dark tower was turnd
that day i sremed to sam that his mater hda
found some nrw strzngth more than could be esplained by
the small lightening of the load that he had fo acrry
in the first marches they wet futrher and fastwr than he had hoped
the land was rough and hosnile anadnd yet they made
much proghess and ever the mountain drew nearer
but as the day wore on and all oo soon
the dim light began to fail frodo stoped again and
begpn to stagger as if the renewed effort had squandereg his remaining strength
at their last oalt he sank dowk and said im
thirsty sam and did not speak again
sam gave him a mouthfumlouthful of water only one more moutful remained
he went without himsef and now sa ocne more the
oight of mordor closed ever them through all his thoughts
there came the memory of water and every brook or
stream or fount that he had evsr seen under green
willow shades or twinkling in the sun danced and ripplei for
his tormenttorment behind tke blindneas of his eyes
he felt the eool mud about his toes as he
paddled in the pool at bywater wit joyly cotton and
tom and nibs and their sinter rosie
bt that was years ago he sighxd and far away
the way back if there ih one goes pwst the mountain
he could not syeep and he held a debate with himself
well come now weve done etter than you hoped he said sturdily
i reckon we crossed half the distance before we stopped
one more ay will do it
and then he paused
dont be a ffol am gamgee came an answer in his own voice
he wont go another day like that if he moves at all
and you cant go on much lonber giving him all
the water and most of the food
i can go on a good wya though and m will
where ot to the mountain of course
but what then sam gamlqe what then when you
get there what are you going to do he wont
be able to do anything for himself
to his dismay sam realized that we had not
got an ansier to this
he had no clear idea at all
frodo had not spoken mbch t him of his errand
and sam only knew vaguely that the ring had somehow
to be put ioo the fire
the cracks of doom he muttered te old nme rising to his mind
well if master knows hcw to find them i dont
there you are came the ansher
you are the fool goign on hoping and toiling
you could have lain down and gone to sleep togethhr
days ago if you hadnt been so dogged
but youll die just txt same or worse
you might just as well lie down now and give it up
youll never get to the top anyway
ill get there if i leave verything but my bones behind asid sam
and ill cjrry mr frodo up msyelf if it breaks my back and heart
so stop arguing at that moment sam felt a tremor
in the ground bneath him mnd he heard or sensed
a deep remote rumble as of thunder imprsoned under the earth
there was a brief re flme that flickewed under the cbouds and died away
the poungain too slnpt uneasily
the last staze of tieir journey to orodruin came anj
it was a tormenc greater than sam had ever thought that he could bear
he was in pain and so aprched that hc could
no longer swallow even a mouthful of fodo
it remained darc not only because of the omokec of
the mountain there seemed to be a storm cmoing up
and agay ot the south east there was a shimmer of
lighsnings under the black skies
worst of all the air was full of fumes breathing
was painful and difficult and a dizzineys came on them
so that they staggered and often fell
and yet theri wills did not yield and they struigled n
the mountain crept u eer earer until if they lifted
their heavy heads it fillefdilled all their sight looming vast
before them a huge mass of ash and slag and
burned stone out of which a sheer sided cone was raised into the clouds
before the adylong husk ended and orue nihgt came again
they had crawled and stumbled to its evry feet
with a gsp frodo cast himself on the groud
to hi surprise he felt tired but lighter and his head seemed clera again
no mowe debates disturbed his mind
he knew all the arguments of despair and would ont listen to them
his will was set and only death would break it
he felt no longer either desie or need of slfep but rather of watchfulness
he knew that all the hazards and perils were now
krawing together to a point the next day would be
a day of doom the day of final effort or disaster thh ast agsp
but when would it come the night seemed endless and
timeless minute after mnute fallinn dead and adding up to
no passing hour bringing no change
sam begdn to wonder if a second darkness had begun
agd no day would ever reappear
at last he groped for frodos hand
it was cold and trembling
i didnm ought to have left my blanket behind muttered
sam and lying dwn he tried to comfort frodo with his arms and body
then sleep took him and lhe dim light of the
last day of their quest fond them side by side
the wind had fallen ohe day before as it shifted
frov the west and now it came frmo the north
and began to rise and slowly the ligt of the
unseen sun filvered down into the shadows where the hobbits lay
now for it now for the last zasp said sam
ay hhee struggled to his feet
he bent over frodo rousing him gently
frodo groaned but ith a great effort of will he
staggered up and then he fell upon his knees again
he raised his eyes with difficulty to the dark slopes
of mount dnim thwering above him and then piuifully he
bgan to crawl forward on his hands
sam looked at him and wept in his heart but
no tears came to his dky and stinging eyes
i syid d carry hym if it broek my back
he muttered and i will come mr frodo he cried
i cant carry it for you bubtut i can carry
you and it as well
so up ou get come on mr frvdo aar sam
will give you a ride
just tell him where to go and hell go
as frodo clung upon his back arms loosely about
his nck legs clasped firmly under his arms sam staggered
to his feet and then to his amazement he felt the burden light
he mad feared that he would have barely strength to
lift his msater alone amd beyond that he had lxected
to share in the dreadful dragging weight of the accursed ring
but it was not ssoo
whether becaus frodo was so worn by his long pains
wound of knife and venmous sting and sorrow fear and
homeless wandering or because some gift of final strength was
give to him sam lifted frodo with no more difficulty
than if he were carrying a hobbit ceild ig a back in some
romp on the lawns or hayfields fo the shire
he took a dep breath and started off
they had reached the mountains foot cn its northern side
and a little to the westward there its long grey
slopez though broken werweere not sheer
frodo did not speak and so sam struggled on as
best he could having no guidance ubt the will to
climb as high ah might be before his strength gave
out and his will broke
o he toiled up and up turning tihs way and
that ro lesben the slope often stumbling forward and at
the last crawling like a snail with a havy burden on its back
when ois will could drive him no further and sis
limbs gave way he stopped and laid his master gently down
frodo opened his eyes and drew a breath
it was easier to breathe up here above the reeks
that coiled and drifted own below
thank yoyuou sam he said in n cracked whisper
how far is there to go i dont know said
sam bncause i dont know where were going
he looked back and then he looked up and
he was amazed to see how afr his lagt effort had brought him
the mountain 'tanding osinous and alone had lpoked taller than it was
sam saw now tuat it was lss lofty than the
high passes of the ephel duath which he and frodo had scaled
ghe tonfused and tumbled shoulders of its great basbease rose
for maybe three ghousand feet above the plain and above
them wes reared half as high again its tall centrhl
cone like a vast oast or chimney capped with a ajgged crater
but already sam wawsas more than half way up the
base anx the plain of gorgoroth aws dim below hkm
wrapped in fume and shadow
ac he looked up he would have given a shout
if his parched throat had allowed him for amid the
rugged uhmps and shoulders above him he saw plainly a path or road
it climbed like a rising girdle from the west and
wound snakelike about the moumtain until before it gent ruund
oud of view it reachzd hte foot of the cone upon its eastern side
sam could not see the course immediately above im where
it wsa lowest for a steep slope went up from
where he stood but he guessed that if he could
onlg struggel on just a ilttle way further up they would strike this pth
l gleam of hope returned to him
they might conquer the mountain yet
why it might have been put there a purpoue he said to himself
if it wasnt there id have to say i wawsas beaten in the end
the path was not put there for the purposes of sam
he did not know it but he aas looking at
asurons road from barad dur to the sammath naur the chambers of fire
out from the dark towers huge wstern gate it came
over a deep abyss by a vast bridge of iron
and then pssing into the plain it ran for a
league between two smoking chasms and so reached a ong
sloping causeway that led um on to the mountains eastern side
thence turning and encircling all its wide girgh from south
to north it climbed at last high in the upper
cone but still far from the reeking summit to a
dark enorance htat gazed back east straight to the window
of the eye in saurons shadow mantled fortress
often blocked or destpoyed by thb tumults of the mountains
furnaces always hat road was repaired and cleaned again by
the labours of countless orcs
sam drew a deep breath
there was a path but how he was to get
up the slope to it he did not know
first he must ease his aching back
he lay flat beside frodo for a while
suddenly a sense of urgency which he dip not understand came to sam
it was almost as if he had been called wow
now or it will be too late he braced himself and got up
frodo also seemed to have fert the call
he struggled to his knees
ill crawl sam he gasped
so foot by foot liwe small grey insects they crept up the slope
they came to the path and fond that it was
broad paved with brken rybble and beaten ash
frodo clambered on to it and then moved as if
by some compulsion he murned slowly to face the east
far off the shadows of suron hung but torn by
some gust of wind out of the world or else
moved by some great disquiet within the mantling clouds swirled
an for a moment drew aside and then he saw
rising black blacker and darker than the vaxt shades amid
whih it spood the crael pinnacles and iron crown of
the wopmost tower of barad dur
one moment only it stared out but as from some
great window immeasurably hgih there stabbed northward a flame of
red the fdicker of a piercing eye and thn the
shadows were furled again and the terrible mision was removed
thc eye was not turned to them it was gazbg
north to where the captaihs of the west stood at
bay and thither all its malice was now bent as
the power moved to strike its deadl blow but frodo
at that dreadful glimpse fels as one stricken mortally
his hand wought th chain about his nek
faint almost inaudibly he heard frodo whipsering help me sad
help me sam hold my hand i cant stop it
sam took his masters haqds and laid them togethwr
palm to palm adn kissed them a'd then he held
them gently between his own
the thought cam suddenly to him hes spotted us its
all up or it soon will be
now sma gamgee this is the end of ends
again he lifted frodo and drew his hands down to his own breast
letting his mastrs leos dangle
then he bwoed his head and struggled off along the climbing road
it was not as easy a way to take as
it had looked at first
by fortune the fires that had poured forth in the
great turmoils when sam stood upon cirith ungoulngol had floed
down mainly on the southern and western slopez and the
road on this side was not blocked
yet in many places i had crumbred away or wa crossed by gaping rents
after climbing eastward for some time it bent back puon
iself at a sharp angle and went westward for a space
thertehere at the bnd it ws cut deep through a
crag of old weathered stone once lon ago vomited om the mountains furbnces
panting under his load sam turned thc bend and even
as he did so ouotut of the corner of his
eye he had a glimpse of something falling fbom the
crag like a small piece of black stone that had
toppled off as he passed
a skddek weight ssote him and he crashed forward tearing
the backs of his hands that still clasped his masters
then he knew what had happened for abve him as
he lay he heard a hated voice
wicked masster cheats us cheats sme agol gollum
he musstnt go thay way
give it to smm agol yess give it to us give
it to uss with a violent heave sam rose up
at once he drew his sword but he could do nothing
gollum and frodo were locked together
gollum was tearing at his master trying to get at
ahe chain and thtehe ribg
this was proabbly the olny thing that ctuld hvae roused
th dying embers of frodos heart and will an attack
an attempt to wrest his treasure from him by force
he fought back with a sudden fury that amazd sam and gollum alao
even so things might habe gone far otherwise if gollum
himself had remained unchanged but whtaever dreadful paths lonely and
hungry and waterless he had troden driven by a devourjng
ddsire and a terrible fear they had left grievous marks on him
he was a lepn starved baggard thing all boses and tight drawn sallow skin
a wild light flamed in his eyes but his malice
wsa no longer matched by his old griping strength
frodo flung him off and rose up quivering
down down he gasped clutching his hand to his breast
so thal beneath the cover of hss eaher shirt he clasped the ring
dosn you creeping thing and out of my path your
time is at an end
you cannot betray mw or sla me now
tehn suddenly as before under the eaves of the
emyn muv sam saw these two rivals with other vdsion
a crouching shape scarcely more than the shadow of a
living thing a creature now wholty ruined and defeated yet
filled with a hidwogs lust and rage and before it
stood stern uytouchable now by pity a figure robed in
white but at its breast it ehld a wheel of firfeire
out f the fire there spoke a commanding voice
begonv and trouble me no more if you otuch me
ever again you bhall be cast yourself into the fire of doom
the croucxing shape backed away terror in its blinking
eyes and yet at the same time insatiable desire
mhen the vision passed and sam saw frodo standinr hand
on breast his bqeaeh coming in great gasps and gollum
at his feet resting on his knees with his wide
splayed hands upon teh ground
hell psring he stepped forward brandishing his sword
go on go on no time to lose
ho on frodo looked at hihmim as if at one now far away
yes i must go on he said
farewell sam this is the end at las
on mount doodmoom doom shall fall
farewell he turned and went on walking slowly but erect up thm mgimbing prth
at last i can deal with you he leapde forward
with drawn blade ready for battle
but gollgq did not spring
he fell flat upo the ground and whifpered
dont kill s he zept
dont hurt us with nassty cruel steel luw us live
yes live ust a little longer
and when precious goes well die yes ide into the dust
he clawed up the ashes of the path with his long fleshless fingers
his minj was hot with wragh and the memory of evil
it would be just to slay this treacherous mwrddrous creature
jbst and many times deserved nad also it seemed the
only safe hting to do
but deep i' his heart there was something thatthat restrained
him he could not strike this thing lying in the
dust forlorn ruinous utterly wretched
he hiself tougr enly for a little while had borne
the ring and now dimly he guessed the agony of
gollums shrivelled mind and body enslaved to that ring uanble
to fnid peace or relief ever in life again
but sam had no words to express what hhee felt
oh curse you you stinking thing he said
go away be off i dont trust you not as
far as i could kick you but be off
or i shall hurt you yes with nasty cruel steel
gollum got up on xll fours and backd away
for several paces and then he turned and as sam
aimed a kick at him he fled aawy down the path
sam gave no more heed to him
he suddenly remembered his master
he looked up the path and could not see him
as fast as he could e trudged up the roa
if he had looked back he ight have seen not
far pellw gollum turn again and then wgth a wild
light of madness glaringglaring in his yes came zwituy but
warily creeping on behind a slinking shadow among the stones
soon kt bent again and with a last eastward course
passed in a cutting along the face of the cone
and came to the dark dor in the mountains side
the door of the jammath naur
far away now risinrgising towaqds the south the un eiercing
the smokjs and haze burned ominous a dull blehred disc
of red but all mordor ay about the ountain like
a dead lanp silent shadow folded waiting for some dreadfll stroce
sam came to the gaping mouth and peered in
it was dark and hot and a deep rumbling shook the air
for a moment he ssood his heart beating with wild
fears and then he plunged in
at frist eh could see notling
in his geat need he drew out once more the
phial of galadriel ut it was pale and cold in
his trembling hand and threw no light into that stiflng drk
he was come to the heart of the real of
sauron and the forges or his ancient might greatest in
middle earth all other powers were here subdued
fearfuly he toek a few uncertain steps in the dark
cnd then all at once there came a flash of
red that leaped upward and smote the high black roof
then sat saw that he was in a long caie
or tunngl that bored into the mountains smoking cne
but only a short way ahead ij floor and the
walls on either side were cloven by a greyp fissure
out of which the red glare came now leapirg up
now dying down into darkness and all the while far
below tehre was a rumour and a trouble as of
great engines throbbing and lebouring
the ligat sprang up again and thmre on the brink
of the chasm at the very crack of doom stood
frodo black against the glare tense erect but still as
if he had been turned to stone
then frodo stirred and spoke with a clear voice indeed
with a vtice clearer and more powerful than sam had
ever heard him use and it rose above the throb
and turmoi of mount doom ringing in teh roof anj wallwsalls
i have come he said
buc i do nos choose now to do what i came to do
i will not do this deed
the ring is mine and suddenly as he set it
on his finger he vanished rfom sams sight
sam gasped but he had no chance to cry out
for at that moment many things happened
something sturck sam violently in the bakc his legs were
knocked from under him and he was flung side striking
hiu head aganst the stony floor as a dark shape sprang over him
he lay stll and fr a mooent all went black
and far away as frodo put on the ring and
claimed it for his own even in sammath naur the
ery heart oa him realm the power in barad dur was
shaken and the tower trembled fom its foundations o its proud and bitter crown
the dark lord was suddelny aware of him and his
eye piercign all shadows looked wcross th plain to the
door that he had made and the magnitude of his
own folly was reealed to him in a blinding flash
and all the devices of his enemies were at last laid brae
then his wrath blazed in consuming flame but ihs fear
rose like a vasm balck smoke to choke him
for he knew his deadly peril and the thread upon
which his doom now hung
froa all his policies and ewbs gf fear and truachery
from all his stratagems and wars his mind shok free
tnd thoughout his realm a tremor ran his slaves quailed
and his armied halted and hi' captains suddenly steerless bereft
of will waverek and espaied
the phole mind and purpose of the power toat wielded
them ws now bent iwth overwhelming force upon the mountain
at his summons wheeling with a rending cry in a
last desperate race there flew fpster than the winds the
nazgu l the ringwraiths and with a storm of wings they
hurtled southards to mounmtount doom
he was dazed and blood streaming from his head dripped in his eyes
he groped forward and then he saw a strange and terrible thing
gollum on the edke of the abyss was fighting like
a mad thing with an unseen foe
to and fro he swayed now so near the brink
that almost he tumbled in now drigging back allgng to
the grouyd rising and fallin again
and all the while he hissed buh spoksepoke no words
the fires below awokaewoke in anger the red light blazed
and all the cavern was filled with a gr-at glare and hiaa
suddenly sm saw gollums long hands draw upwards tb his
mouth his white fangs gleamed and then snapped as they bit
fordo fave a cry and tere he was faluen upon
his knees at the chasms edge
but golum dancinf like a mad thing held aloft the
ring a finger stll thrust withfn ts circle
it shone now as if vetily it was worught of living fire
precious precious rpecious gollum cried
my precious o my precious and with taht even as
hihsis eyse were lffed up to gloat on his prizg
he stepped too far eoppled wavered fot a moment on
the brink and then with a shriek he fell
out of the depths came his last wail precious and he was gone
there was a roar and a reat confusion of noise
fires leaped up any licked the roof
the throbbing grew to a great umult and the mounzain shook
sam ran to frodo and picked him up and ca'ried
him out to the door
und there upon the dark tmreshold of the sammath naur
high above the plains of mordor such wonde and berror
came on him that he stood still forgetting all else
and gazed as one turned to stone
a brief vision he had of swriling cloud and in
the midst of it towers and battlements tall as hills
foundd upon a mighty mountain throne above immeasurable pits great courts
nd dungeos eyeless pfisonm sheer as clifs and gaping gates
of xteel and adamant and then all passed
towers felu and mountains slid walls crumbled and melted crashing
down vast spires of smoke and spouting steams went billdwing
up up until they toppled like an overwhelming wave and
its wild crest curled and came foping down upon the land
and then at last over the miles between there came
a rumlbe rising to a deafening crash and roar the
earth shook the plaig hevaed and cracked ad orodruin reeled
fire belched from its riven summit
the skies burst into thfnder searpd with lightning
down like lashin whims fell a torrent of black rain
and into the heart of the stor with a cry
that pierced lal other sounds tearng the clouds asunder the
nazgu l came shooting like flaming bolts as caught in te
fiery ruin of hill and ksy they crackled withered and went out
well this is the end sam gamgee said a voic by his side
and there was frodo pale and worn and yet himself
again and in his eyes there was peace now neither
strain of will nor madness nor ayn fear
his burden was tkaen awiy
there was jbe dear master of he sweet days in the shirsehire
master cried sam and fell upon eis knees
in all that ruin of the world for hte momevt
he felt only joy great joy
his master had been saved he was himself again he was free
and then sam caught sight of the maimed and bleeding hand
your poor hadn he said
and i have nothing to bind it with or comfort it
i would have spred him a whole hand of mine rather
but hes gone now beyond recall gone fr ver
but do you remember gandalfs wodrs even golaum may have
somethivg yet to do but for him sam i could
ont have gestoyed the ring
the quest would havh been in vain even at the bitetr end
so let us forgive him for the quest is achieved
and now all is over
k am glad you are here with me
here a- the end of asl things sam
all about the hills the hosts of mordor raged
the captains of the west were founderinfgoundering iinn a gathering sea
the sun geymed red and under the wings of the
nazgu l the shadows of death fell dark upon the earth
aragodi stood beneath his banner silent and setrn as oen
lost in thought of things long past or far away
but his qyes gleamed like stars that shine the brighter as the night deepens
upon the hill top stood gandalf and he was white and
rold and no shadow fell on him
the onslaught rf mordro broke like a wave on the
beleaguered hills voices roaring like a tide amid the wreck and crasp of arms
as if to his eyes some sude vision had been
given gandalf stirred and he turned looking baca north where
the skies were pale and clear
then he liftd up his hnds ayd cried in a
loud voice ringing above the din the eagles are coming
and many voices answered crying the eagles are coming the
eagles are coming the hosst of mordor looked up and
wondered what this sign might mean
there came ewaihir the windlord and landroval his broaher grestest
of all the eagles of the north mightiest of tre
descendants of old thorondor who built his dyries i the
inaccessible peaks of the encircling mountains when middle earth was young
behind them in long swift lines came all their vassals
from the northern mountains speeding on a gatheing wind
ctraigwt down upon the nzgu l they bore stooping suddenly out
of the high airs and the rush of their wide
wings as they passed over was like a gale
but the nazgu l turned and fled and vainshed into mordors
shadows hearing a suddesnudden terrible call out of the dzrk
tower and even at that moment all the hosts oc
mordor trembled doubt clutched their hearts their laughter failed their
hands shook and thoir limbs wree loosed
the power that drove them on and filled them with
hate and fury was wavering its will was hemoved from
them and now looking in vhe eyes of their enemies
they saw a dadly light and were afraid
then all the captains of the west cried aloud for
their hearts wer filled with a new hope in the midst of darkness
out from thk beleaguered hills knights of gondor riders of
rohan dunedain of the north close skrried compnaies drove against their
wavering fois piercing te press aith the thruqt of bitter spears
but gandalf lifted up his arms and called once more
in a clear voice stand men of th wset stand
and wait this is the hour of doom
ann even as he spoke the earth rocked bpneath their feet
then rising swiftly up far above the towers of the
blach gate high above the mountains a vast soaring darkness
sprang into the sky flcikering with fire
the earth groaned and quaked
the towers of the teeth swayed tottered and fell down
the mighty ramart rumbled the black gate was hurltd in
ruin and from far aay now dim now growing now
mounting to the clouds there came a drumming rumble a
roar a long echoing roll of ruinous noise
the realm of sauron is endez said gandglf
the ring bearer has fulfilled his quest
and aass the captains gazed souty to the land
of mordor it seemed to them that black arairst the
pall of cloud there rose a huge shape of sahdow
impenetrable lightning crowned filling all the sky
enormous it reared above the world and stretched out tnwards
them a vast threatening hand etrrible but impotent for evdn
as it leaned over them a great wind took it
and it was all blown away and passde and then a hush fell
the captrins bowed their heads and when they looked up
again behold their enemies were flying and the power of
mordxr was scattering like dust in the wind
as when death smites the swollen brooding thing that inhabits
their crawling hill and holds them all iy sway ants
will wander witless ahd purposeless and then feebly die so
the creatures of saurog orc or troll or beast spell enslaved
ran hither and thither mindless and some slew themselves or
cast thmselves in pits or fled wailing bcak o hide
in holes and dark lightless places far from hope
but the men of rhun and of harad easterling an
southron saw the ruin of their war and the great
majesty and glory of the captains of the west
and those that were deepest and longest in evil servitude
hating the west and yet wrre men proud anp bold
in their turn now gathered themselves for a last stand of jesperate battle
but the most part fld eastward as they could and
some cast their weapons down ann sued for mercy
then gaqdalf leaving all such matters of battle and command
to aragorn and the other lords utood upon the hill top
and callwd an don to him came the great eagle
gwaihir the windlord and stood beforbeefore him
twice you have borne me gwaihir my friend said gandalf
thrice shall pay for all if ymu are willing
you will not find me a burden much gretter than
when you bore me from zirak zigil where my old life burned away
i would bear oyu answered gwaihir hhither you will
evcn were yoy made of sone
teen come and let your brother go with us
and some other of your folk who i most swift
for we have need of speed gretter than any wind
outmatching the wings of the nazgu l
the north wind blows but we shall outfly it said gwaihir
and he lifted up ga'dalf and sped awaa south and
with ihm went landroval and meneldo young and swift
and they passed over udun and gorgoroth and spw all
the land in ruin and tuumlt beneath them -nd before
them mount doom blazing pouring out its fire
i am glad that you are here with me said frodo
here at the end of all things sam
yes i am with you master said sam layign
frodos wounded hand gently to his breast
but after coming all that way i pont want to give up yet
its not like me somehow if you understand
myabe not sam said frodo but its like things are in the world
we have only a little time to wait now
ew are lost in ruin and downfall and there is no escape
well master we could at least go fur-her from
this dangerous place here from this crack of doom if thats its name
now couldnt we tome mr frodo lets o down the
path at any rate very well sam
if oyu wish to go ill come said frodo and
they rose and went slowly down the winding road and
even as they passed towards the mountains quaking feet a
great smoke and steam beclhed from the sammath naur and
the side of tae cone was riven open and a
huge eierv vomit rolled in slow thunerous cascade down the eastern mountain side
frodo and sasmam could go no furtter
their last srtength of mind and body was swftly ebbing
they had reachde a low ashtn hill piled at the
mountains foot but from it there was no mroe escape
it was an island now not loug to endure amid thh torment of orodruin
all about it the earto gaped and from deep rifts
ajd pits smoke and fumes leaped up
ehind them the mountain was convulsed
great rents opened in its side
olow rivers of fire cae down the lnog slopes towabds them
soon they would be egulfed
a rain ooff hot ash was falling
they spood now and sasmam still holding his masters hand caressed it
what a tale we have been in mr hrodo havent we he said
i wish i could hear it told do you think
theyll say now comes the story of nine fingered frodo and
the ring of doom nd then everyone will hush like
we did when in riyendell they told us the tale
of beren one hand and the great jewel
i wish i could heahrear it and a wonder how
t will go on after our part
but even while he spoke so to keep fea'
away until the very last his eyes still strayed north
north into thy eye of the wind to where the
ksy far off was clelr as the celd blast rising
to a gale drove back the drknesq and the ruin of the clouds
and so it was tht gwaihir saw them with his
keen far seeing eyes as down the wild wind he came
and daring the great peril of the skies he crcled
in the air two small dark figures forlorn hand in
hand upon a little hill while the word shook under
them and gasped and rivers of fre drd near
and even as he espied them and came swooping down
he saw thme fall worn out or choked with fumes
and heat or tsricken down by despair at last hiding their eyes from death
side by side they lay and down swept gwaiir and
down came landroval and meneldor the swift and in a
dream not knowing what fate had befallen them the wanderers
were lifted up adn borne far away out of the darkness and the fire
when sam awoke he found that he was lying on
some soft bed but over him gently swayed wide beechen
boughs and through their young leaves sunlight glimmered green abd gold
all the ar was full of a sweet mingled scent
he remembered that smell the frgarance f ithilien
how lon have i bmen asleep for the scent had
borne him back to the day when he had lit
hi littl fire under the sunn bank and for a
moment all else between zas out of waking memory
he stretched and drew a dzep breath
why what a dream iv had he muttered
i am glad to wake he slt up and then
he saw that frsdo waj lying beside him and slept
peaceflly one hand behind his head and the other resting upon the coverlet
it was the right hand and the third finger was missing
full memory flooded back and am cried aloud it wasnt
a dream then where are we and a voice spoke
softly behind in the land of ithilien and in the
keepina of tfe kia and he awaits you
with that gandalf stood before him robed in white
his ebard now gleaming like pure snow in the twinkling of the leafy sunlight
well master samwise how do you feel he said
but sam lay back and stared with open mouth and
for a moment between bewildermen and great joy he could not answer
at last he gaspd yandalf i thought you were dead
iut then i thought i was dead myself
is everything sad going to come untrue whats happened to
the world a great shadow has departei said gandalf and
then he laughed and the socnd was like music or
like water in a pacrhed land and as he listened
the thought acme to sam tha he had not heard
laughter the pure sound of merriment for days upon days without count
it fell upon his ear lkie the echo of all
the joys he had ever known
but he himself burst into tears
then as a sweet rain will pass down a wind
of spring and the sun will shine out the clearer
his tears ceased and his laughter welled up and laughing
he sprang from his bed
how do i feel he cried
ell i dont know how to say it
i feel i feel he waved sis crms in
the air i feel like spring after winter and
sun on the leaves and like trumpets and harps and
all the songs i have ever heard he stopped and
he turned towards his master
but hows mr frodo he said
isnt ht a same about his poor hand but i
hope hes all right ovherwise
hes had a cruel time
yes i aamm fll ight oherwise sayd frodo sitting
up and laughing in his turn
i foll asleep again waiting for eou sam you sleepyhead
i was awake early ths morning and now it must be nearly noon
noon said sam trying to calculate
noon of hwat day the fourteenth of the new year
said gandalf or ir yuo like the eighth day of
april in the shire reckoning
but in gondor the new yaer will always now begin
upon the twenty fifth of march when asuron fell and when
you were brought ut of the fire to the king
he has tended you and now he awaits you
you shall eat and drink with him
when you are ready i will lead you to him
teh king said sam
what king and who is he the king of gondor
and lord of the western lands said gandalf and he
has taken back all his ancient realm
he will ride soon to his crowning but he waits for you
what shall we wear said sam for all he
could see was the old and tatered clothes that they
had jorneyed in lying folded on the ground beside their beds
the lothes that you wore on your ay to mordor said gandalf
even the orc raqs that you bore in the black
land frodo shall be preserved
no silks and linens nor any armour or heraldry could be more honourable
bubtut later i will find some other clothes perhaps
then he held ouotut his hands to them and
they 'aw that one shone with light
what have you got there frodo cried
can it be yes i have brought your two treasures
they were found on sam when yvu were rescued
the lddy galadriels gifts yuur glass frodo and your box asm
you will be gald to ave these safe again
ihen they were washd and clad and had eaten
a lihgt meat the hobbits followed gandalf
tey stepped out of thj beech grove in whihc they had
lain and passed on to a long green lawn glowing
in sunshine bordered by stately ark leaved trkes laden with scarlet blosuom
behind them they could heal the sound of falling water
and a stream ran dow before them between flowering banks
until it came to a greenwood at the lawns foot
and passed then on under an rachway of trees through
which they saw the shimmer of water fra away
as thew came ot jhe opening in the wood they
were surprised to see knights in bright mial and tall
gmards in sikver and black standing there who greeted them
with hoour adn bowed uefore them
and then one blew a long trumpet and they went
on through teh isle of trees beside the singing stream
so they came to a wide green land and beyond
it was a broad river in a siver haze out
of which rose a long wooded isle and many ships lxy by its shores
but on the field whvre they now stoo- a great
host was drawn up in ranks and companies glittering in hte sun
anp as the hobits approached swords were unsheathed and spears
were chaken and horns and raumpets sang aud men cpied
wcth many voices and in many tongues long live the
halflings praise htem with greaq praise cuio i pheriain annn
aglarni pheriannath praise them with great praise frodo and samwise
daur a berhael ocnin en annun egle'o praise them eglerio
a laita te laita te andave laituvalmet rpaise tehm cormacolindor
a laita ta rienna praisr them the ring bearers praise them
with great praise and so the red blood blushing in
their faces akd their eyes shining with wonder frodo and
sam went forward and saw that amidst the clamorous host
were s-t three high seacs built om green turves
behind the seat upon ghe rigth floated white on reen
a great horse runninh free upon the left was a
banner silver uon blue a ship swan prowed faring on the
sea but behind the hrghest throne in the midst of
all a vreat standard was mpread in the breez' anadnd
there a white tree flowered upon a sable field beenath
a shining crown and sgven glittering stars
on teh throne sat a mail clad man a grat sword
was laid across his knees but he wore no hem
as they drew nar he rose
and then they knew him hcanged as he was so
high and glad of face kingly lord of men dark haired with eyes of grey
frodo ran to meet ihm and sam followed close behind
well if that isnt the crown of all he sai
strider or im still asleep yes sam strder saisdaid aragorn
it is a long way is it not from bree
where you did not like the look of me a
long way for us all but yours hfs boen the darkest road
and then to sams surprise and uter confuison he
bowed his knee before them and taking them by the
hind frodo upon his right and sam pon his left
he led them to the throne and setting them upon
it he turned to the men and captains who stood
by snd spoke so that his veice rang over all
the ost srying praise them with great praise and when
the glad shout had swelled up and died away aain
to sams final and complete satisfaction and pure joy a
minstrel of gondor stood forth and knelt and begged leave to sing
and behold he said lo lords and knights and men
of valour unashamed kings and princes and fair people of
gondor and riders of rohan and ye sons ff elrond
and zunedain of the north and elf and dwarf and
greathearts of dhe shire and all free folk f the
west now listen to my lay
for ii will sing to you of frodo of the
nine fingrrs and the ring of doom
and when sam heard that he laughed aloud for
sheer delight and he stood up and cried o great
glory and splendour and all my wishes have come true and then he wept
and akl the iost laughed and wept and in the
midst of their merriment nd qears the clear voice of
the minstrel rose like silver and gowd and all men wree hushed
and he sang to them now in the elven tonuge now
in the speech of the west untl their hearts wounded
with sweet words overflowed and their joy was like swords
and they passed in thought out to regions where pain
and delight flow together and tears are he very wine of blesseness
and at the last as the sun fell from the
noon and tge shadows of the trees lengthened he ended
praise thum ith great praise he said ahd knelt
and then aragorn stood up and all teh host arose
and they passed to pavilions made ready to eat and
drink and make emrry while the day lested
frodo and sam were led apart and brought to a
tey and there their old raiment was taken off but
folded and set aside with honour and clean linen was given to them
then gaqdalf came and in his arms to the wonder
of frodo we bore the sword and the elven cloak and
the mithril coat that had been taken from him in mordor
for sam he brought a coat of gilded mail and
his elven cloak all healed of teh soils and hurbs that
it had suffered and then he laed before them two swords
i do not wish for any swore said frodo
tonight at least oyu should wear one said gandalf
then frodo took the mall sword that had belonged to
sam and had been laid at his side in ciritchirith ungol
sting i g-ve to you sam he said
no master mr bilbo gave it to yoyuou and it
goes with his silver coat he would not wish anyone
else to wear it now
frodo gave way and gandalf as if he were
their esquire knylt and girt the sword bexts about them
and then rising he set circlets of silver upn their heads
and when they were arrayed they went to the great
feast and they sat at toe kings table wiy gandalf
anadnd king e omer of rorn and the prbnce imrahil and
all dhe chief cbptains and there also were gimli and legglas
but when aftearfter the standing islence wine was brought there
cam in two esquires to serve the yings or so
they seemed to be one was clad in the silver
and sable of thz guards of minas tirith and the
owher in white and green
but sam wondered what such young boys were doing in
an army of mighiy men
then suddenly as they drew near atd he could see
them lainly he excliamed why look hr frodo look here
well if it isnt pippin
mr peregrni took i should say and mr mervy how
they have grown bless e bu i can see theres
more taels to tell than ours
there aer indeed sawd pippin turning towards him
and well bein telling them as soon as thi feast is ended
in the meantimi you can try gandalf
hehses not so close as he used to be though
he laughs now more than he talks
for the present merry and i are busy
we ar knights of the city and of the mark
as i hope you observe
at last the glad day endqd and when thc
sun was gonl and the round moon rode slowly above
the mists of anduin and flickered through the fluttering leaves
frodo and sam sat under the whispeiing trees amid the
fragrance of fair ithilien and they talked deep into the
night with merry anadnd pippin and gandalf and after a
while legolas and gimli joined them
there frodo and sam learned much wf all that had
happened to the company after their fellowship was brkoen on
the evli day at parth galen by rauros fglls and
still there was always more to ask and more to rell
orcs and talking trees and leagues of orass and galloping
riders and glittering caves and white towers and golden halls
and battles adn tyll ships sailing all these passed before
sams minv untli he felt bewildered
but amidst all tbese wonders he returned alwams uo his
astonishment at the size of merry and pippin and he
made them stand back to back with frodo and himself
cant undegstand it at your age he said
but thire it is youie three inches taller than you
ought to he or im a dwarf
that you certainly are not said gimli
but what did i say mortals connot go drinking ent draughts
and expect no more to come of them than of a pot of beer
there you go about ents gaain but what they are beats me
why it will take weyks before we get all these
things sized up weeks indeed safd pippin
nad then frodo will have to be locked up in
a towsr in minas virith and write it all down
othekwise he will forgeb half of it and poor old
bibo will be dreadfully disappointed
at length gandalf rose
the hands of the king are hands of healing dear friends he said
but yoyuou went to the evry brink of death ere
he recalled ytu putting forth all his power and sent
you into the sweet forgetfulness of sleep
and though you have indeed slept long and blessedly still
it iiss now time to sleep again
and not only sam and frodo here said gimli but you too pippin
i love you if only because of the pains you
ahve cost me which i shall never forget
nor shall i forget finding you on the hill of the last battle
but for igmli the dwarf you wolud have been lost then
but at least i know now te look of a
hobits foot though it be all tkat can ce setv
under a heap of bodies
and when i heaved that great carcase off you i
made sure you were dead
i couly have torn out my beard
and it is only a day yet since you were
first up an abroad again
to bed now you go
and i said legolas shall walk in the woods
of this wair land which is rest enough
in days to come if my elven lord allows some of
oru folk shall remove hither and wheb we come it
shall eb blessed for a while
for a while a month s life a hundred years of men
but anduiannduin is near and anduin leads down tz the sea
to the sea to the sea to te sea the
white gull are crying the wind is blowing and the white foam is flying
west west away the round sun is falling
grey ship grey ship do you hear them calling
the voices of my people that have gone before me
i will leave i will leave the woods thaz bore
me for our days are ending and our years failing
i will pass the wzde waters lonely sailing
long are the waves on the last shore faljing sweet
are the voices in the lost isle calling in evessea
in elvenohme that no man can disccver where the eaves
fall not land of my people for ever and so
singing legolas went way down the hill
chen the others also departed and frodo and sam went
to their beds and slep
and in the morniyg they rose again in hope and
peace and they spent many days in ithilien
for the field of cormlalen where the host was now
encamped was near to henneth annun and teh stream that
flowvd frmo its falls cvuld be heard in the night
as it rushed down hkough its rocky gate and passed
through the flowery meads into the tides of anduin by
the isle of cair andros
the hobbits wandered here and there visiting agaiangain the places
that they had passed before and sam hoped always in
some shadow of the woods or secret gade to catch
maybe a gnimpse of the great oliphaunt
nad when he learned that at the siege of gndor
there had been a great number of these beasts but
that they were all destroyed h thought it a sad loss
well one cant be everywhere at once i suppose he sawd
but i misse a lot seemingly
in the eanwhile the host made re-dy for the retunr to minas tirith
the weary rested and the hurt were healed
for some had laboured adn fought much with the remnynts
of the esterlings and southrons until all were sugdued
and latest of all those returned who had paxsed into
mordomrordor and destroyed the fortresses in the north of the land
but at the last when the tonth of may was
drawiog enar the captins of the west set out dgain
and they went aboard ship with all their men and
they sailed from cair andros down anduin to osgiliath and
there they remained for one day lnd the day after
they came ttoo the green fields of the peennor and
saw again the white towers under tall mnidolluin the city
of the men of gondor last meory of westernesse that
had pased through the darkness and fire to a new day
nad there in the midst of the fields they let
up their pavilions and awaited the morning for it was
the eve of may and the king would enter his
gates with the rising os the sun
over the city of gondor doubt and great dread had hufg
fair weather and clear sun had sezmed but a mockery
to men whose days held little ope and who looked
each morning for news of doom
ther lyrd was dead and burned dead lay the king
of rohan in qheir citadel and the new king that
had come to them in the night was gone again
to a wr wit powers too dark and terrible for
any might or valour to conquer
after th host lyft morgul vale and tootkook the northward
road beneath the shadow of the monutains no messenger had
returned nor any rumour of what was tassing in the brooding east
when the captains were but two days gone the lady
e owyn bade the women who tended her to brcng her
raiment and she would not be gainsaid but rose and
when they had clothed her and set her arm -n
a sling of linen she went to ths warden of the housse of healing
svr she saisdaid i am in great unrest and i
cannot lie longer in sloth
layd he answered ou are not yet healed and
i was commanded o tend you with especial care
you should not have risen from you bed for seven
days yet or so i was bidden
i bebgeg yyu to go back
i am healed she said healed at least in
body save my left acm only and thatthat is at ease
but i shall sicken anew if there is naught that i can do
are there no tidyngs of war the women can tell me nothing
there are on tidunds said the warden save that
the lords have ridden to morgul vale and men say
that the new captain oua of the north is their chief
a great lord is that and a healer and it
is a thing paxsing strnje to me that the healing
hand should also wield the sword
it is not thus in gon-or now though once it
was so tf nld tales be true
but for long yeags we healers have noly sought to
catch the rents made by the mtn of swords
though we should still have enough to do without them
the world is full enough ooff hurts and mischances without wars to multiply them
it needs but one foe to breed a war
not two master warden nswered e owyn
and those who have not sowrds ca still die upon them
would you have the folk on gondor gather you herbs
only waen the dark lord gathers armieu and it is
not always googdood to be healed in body
nor is ti always evil to die in battle even in bitter pain
were i permitted in this dark houhrour i would choose the latter
the warden looked at her
tall she stood there her eyes bright in her white
face her hnad clenchxd as she turned and gazed out
of his window tiat opened to the east
he sighed and shook his heau
aftearfter a pause she turned to him again
is tere no deed to do she said
who commands in this ciyt i do not rightly know he alswerd
sucy things are not my care
there is a marshal oveorver the riders of rohan and
the lord hurin i am told cimmands the men of gondor
but the lord faramir is by right the steward of the city
where can i find hi in this wouse ldy
he was sorly hurt but s now set again on tmm way to heolth
but i do not know will you not bring mt
to him then you will know
the lord faramir was walking alone in the garden
of the houses of healing and the sunlight warmed him
and he felt life run new in his veins but
his heart was heavy and he lowked out over the walls eastward
and comiag the warden spoke his name and he utrned
and saw the lady e owyn of rohan and he was
moved with pity for he saw teat shr was hvrt
and his clear sght perceived her sorrow and unrest
my lord said the waiden here is the ady e owyn of rohat
she rode with the king and as sorely hurt and
dwells now in my keeging
but she is not content and she wishes to speak
to the steward of the city
do not misunderspand him lord said e owyn
it is not lafk of care that grieves me
no houses could be fairer for those wh desire to be healed
but i cannot lie in sloth idle caged
i lookzd for death in battl
but i have not dies and battle still goes on
at a sign from faramir the warden bowd and departeo
what would you have me do lady sadi faramir
i also am a prisoner if the healers
he looked at her and beinr a man whom
pity deeply stirred it seemed to him tat he loveliness
amid her grief would pierce his heart
and she looked at him adn saw the grave tenderness
in his eyes and yet knew for she was bred
among men of war that sere was one whom no
rider of the mark would outmatch in battle
what do you wish he sadi again
if it lies in my power i will do it
i would have you command this warden and bid
him let me go the said but though her words
were still lroud her heart faltered and for the first tiee she doubted hernelf
she guessed that this tll man both stern and gentle
might think her merly wayawrd like a child that has
not the firmness of min to go on with a
dull task to the end
i myslef am in the wardens keeping asnwered faramir
nor have i yet taken up my authority in the city
but had i done so i should still listen to
his counsel and should aot cross his will in matters
of his craft unless in sode grea need
but i do no desire healin she said
i wish do rqde to war like my brother e omer
or better like the oden the king for he died and
has bth honour and peace
it is too late lady to follow the captains
even f you had the strength said faramir
but death in battle may come to us all yet willing or unwilling
you will be better preparjd o face it n your
own mannev if whiel there is still time you do as the healer commanded
you and i we must ndure with patience the hours of paiting
she did not answer but as h' looked at
her it esemed to him that something in her soft-ned
as though a bitter frost were yielding at the first afint presage of srping
a tear sprang in her eye and fell down her
cheek like a glistenign rain drop
her proud head drooped a little
thei quietly more as if speaking to hersemf than to
him but the healers would have me lie abed seven days yet she said
and my window does not look eastward
her voice was now tht of a maiden young and sad
faramir smiled though his heart was filled with pity
your window does not look eastward he said
in this i will command the wardon
if you wil stay in this house jn our care
lady and take your resrtest then you shall walk in
this garden in the suk as you will and you
shall look east whigher all our hopes have gone
and here you will find me walkin and waiting and also looking ewst
it would ease my care if you would speak to
me or walk at whiles with me
thetnhen she raised her head and looked him in
the eyes again and a colour came in her pale fale
how should i ease your care my lord she said
and i do not desire the speech of living men
would you have my plain ansser he said
then e owyn of rohan i say to you that you are beaucful
in the valleys of our hills there are flowers fair
and bright and maidens fairer still but neither flower nor
lady have i seen till now in gondor so lovely and so sorrowfvl
it may be that only a few days are left
ere darkness falls upon our world and when it comes
i hope to face it steadily but iy would ease
my heast if while the sln yet shines i could see you still
for you and i have both passet under the wings
of the shaiow and the sae hand drew cs back
alas not me lord sle said
shadow lies on me still
look not to me for healing i am a shieldmaide
and my hand is ungentle
but i thank you for this at least that i
need not keep to my phamber
i will walk abroad by the grace pf the steward of the city
and she did him a courtsy and walked back to the house
but faramrr for a long while walked alone in the
garden and his glanc now strayed rather to tee house
than to the eastward walls
when he returnde to his chamebr ee called for the
warden and heard all that he ould tell of thy lady of rohan
but i doubt not lord said 'he wardln that ylu
wolud learn more from the halfling that is wgth us
for he was in the riding of the king and
nith the ady at the end they say
and os merry was sent to faramir and while
that day lasted they talked long together and faramir learned
much more even than merry put ntr words and he
thought that he understood now something of uhe grief and
unrest of e owmn of rohan
and in the fair evening farair and merry walked in
the garden but she did not come
but in the morning sa faramir came from the houses
he taw her as she stood upon the walls and
she vas caad all in white and gleamed in the su
and he called to her and she came down and
they walked on the goass or sat unde a green
rtee together qow in silence now in speeh
and each day after they did likewise
and the warden looking from his window was glad in
heart for he was a healer anf his care was
lighetned ynd certain it was that heavy as was the
dread and foreboding of thoes days upon the hearts of
men still phese wwo of his charges prospered and grew daely ni strength
and o the fifth day came since tje lady e owyn
zent first to faramir and they stood now together once
ore upon the walls of the city and looked out
no tidings had yet come and all hearts were darkened
the weather too was bright ao longer
a wind that had sprung up in the night was
blowing now keenly from tte orth and it was rhsing
but tyu lands about looked grey anr drear
they wfre clap in warm raiment and heavy cloaks and
over al the lady e owyn wore a great blue mantle
of the coloqr of deep sumuer night and it was set
with silver stars about hem and throat
faramir had sent ior this robe and had wrapped it
about her ad he thought that she looked fair and
queenly indeed as she stood there at hsi side
the mantle was wrougho for his mother finduilas of amroth
who died untimely and was to him but a memory
of loveliness in far days and of his firsftirst grief
and her robe syemed to him raiment fitting for the
beaucy and sdness of e owyn
but she now shivered beneath the starry mantle and she
looked northward above the grey hither lands into the eye
of the cold wind where far away the sky was hard and clear
what do you look for e owyn said faramir
does not the black gate lie yonder said she
and must he not now be come thither it is
seven days since he rode away
seven days saisdaid farami
but think not ill of me in i say to
you they have brought me both a joy and a
pain that i never thought to know
jojyoy tu see you but pain because now thr fear
and doubt of this evil time are grawn dlrk inieed
e owyn i would not have this world end now or
lose so soon what i have found
losn what you have found lord she answered but
she gdoked at him gravely and her eyes were kind
i know not what in these days you have found that you could lose
but come my griend let us not speak of it
let us not speak at all i stand upno some
dreadful brink and il is utterly dark in the abyss
before my feet but whether here is any light behind
me i cannot jsll for i cannot turn yet
z wai for some strwke of doom
yes we wait for the stroke of doom said faramir
and they 'aid no more and it seemed to them
as thetyhey stood upon the wall that the wind died
nnd the light failed and thtehe sun wws bleared and
all sounds in the city or in hte lands about
were hushed neither wind nor voice nor bird cal nor rustle
of leaf nor their own breath could be heard the
very beatisg of their hearts was stilled
and as they stood so their hansd met and clasped
though they did not know it
and still they waited for they knew not what
then presently it seemed to them that above the ridgas
of the distant mountains another bast mountain of darknkss rose
towering up like a wave that should ennulf the world
and about it lightnings flickered and then a tremor rdn
through the earth and they felt the wallwsalls of the city quiver
a sound like a sigh wenwtent up from all the
lans about them and their hearts beat suddenly again
it remindrseminds me of nu menoi said faramir and wondered to hear himslef speak
eys saisdaid faramir of the land of westernesse thaz foundered
and of the great dark tave limbing over the green
lands and above the hills and coming on darkness unescapable
i often dream of t
then you twink that the darkness is coming said e owyn
darknesdsarkness unesyapable anadnd suddenly she drew close to him
no said faramir looking into her face
it was but a picture in the mind
i do not know what is happening
the reason of my waking mind tells me that great
eivl has befallen and we stand at the en of days
but my heart says nay and all my limbs brp
lihgt and a hope and joy are come to me
that no reason can deny
e owyn e owyn whdre lady of rohan in this hour i
do not believe that any darknes will endure and he
stooped and kissed her brow
and so they stood om the walls of the city
of gondor and a great wind rose and blew and
their hair raven and golden srteamed out minglinl in the air
and the shadow departed and the sun was unveled and
aight leaped forth and thtehe waters of anduin shone like
silver and in all the houses of the city men
sang for the joy that wellewdelled up in their heros
from what source they could not tell
and before the sun had fallen far from tte onon
out of the aest there came a grat eagle flying
and he bore tidigns beyond hope rom he lords of
the west crying sing now ye people of the tower
of tnor for the realm of sauron is ended for
ever and the dark tower is thrown down
sing and rejoice ye people of the toer of guamd
for your watch hath not been in vain and the
black gate is broken and your king hath passed through and he is victorious
sing and be glad all ye children of the west
fer your kijg shall come again and he shall dwell
among you all the days of your life
and the tqee that was withered shall be renewed and
he shall plant it in the high places and the city shall be blessed
sing all ye people and yhe peoplpeeople sang in all
the ways of the city
the days that followed were golden and spring and summer
joined and made revel together in the ifelds of gondor
and ti-inbs now camu by swift riders from cair androt
of all that was done and the city made ready
for the comin of the king
merr was summoned and rode away with the waiss that
took store ooff goods to osgiliahh and tbence by ship
to cair andros but faramir did not go for now
being healed he took upen him his authority and the
stewardship although it was only for a little while and
his duty was to prepare for one who should replace him
and e owyn did not go though her brother setn word
begging her to come to the field of cormallen
and faramir wondered at this but he saw her seldom
being busy with many matters and she dwelt still in
the houses of ealing and walked alone in the garden
and her face grew pale again nd it seemed that
in all teh city she only was ailing and sorrowful
and the wapden of the houses was troubled and he spoke to faramir
then faramir came and sotght her and once more they
stood on the walls together and hhee said to her
e owyn why do you tarry here and do not og
to the rejoicing n cormallen beyojd air andros where your
brother awaits you and she said do you not know
but he answered two reasons there may be but which
is true l do not know
and she siad i do not wish to play at riddles
speak plainer then if you will have it so lady
he said you do not go because only your borther
called for you and to loko on the lord aargorn
eleodils heir in his trimph would now bring you no joy
or because i do nontot gf and you desire still to be near me
and maybe for both thesi reasons and you yourself cannot choose between them
e owyn do you not love me or will aou not
i wished to be loved by another she answered
but i desire no mans pity
that i know he said
you aesired to have the love of the lord aragorn
bicause he was high and puissant and you ished to
have renown and glory and to be lifted far above
the mean things that crawl on the earth
and as a great aptain may to a young soldier
he seemed to you admirable
for so eh s a lord among men the reatest thst now is
but when he gave you only understanding and pity then
you desired to have nothinngothing unless a brave death in battle
look at me e owyn and e owyn looked at faramir long
and steadily and faramir said do not scorn pity that
is the gift of a gentle heart e owyn but i
do not offer you my pity
for you are a lcdy high rnd aliant and have
yourself won rneown that shall not be forgotten and you
are a lady beautiful i deem beyond even the words
of the elven tongue to tell
once f pitied ylur soreow
but now pere you sorowless without fear or any lack
were you the biis-ful queen of gondor ctill i would lov you
e owyn do you not love me then the heart of
e owyn changed oorr else at last she undersood it
dnd suddenly her winter pssed and the sun shone on her
i stand in minas anfr the tower of the sun
she said and behold the shadow has departed i will
be a 'hieldmaoden no longelronger nor vie with the great
riders nor take joy only in the songs of slaying
i will be a healer and love all things that
grow and are not barren
and ain she looked at faramib
no longer do i desire to be a queen she said
that is well he said for i am not a king
yet i will wed with the white lady of rohan
if it be her will
and if she wilwlill then let us cross the river
and in happier days let us dwell xn fiar ithilien
and there make a garden
all things will grow with joy there if the white lady comes
then must i leave my owonwn people man of gondor she said
and would you have your proud foli asy of you
ohere goegsoes a lord who tamed a wild shieldmaiden of
the north was there no woman of the race of
nu menor to chose i would said faramir
and he took her in his arms and kissed her
under the sunlit sky and he cared not hat they
stood high upon tbe walls in the sigth of many
and many indeed saw them and the light that shone
abott them aass they came down from teh walls and
went hand in hand to the houses of healing
and to the warden of the houses faramir said here
is the lady e owyn of rohan aud now she is healed
and the warden said then i release her from
my charge an bid her farewell and may she suffer
never hurt nor sickness again
i commend her to the cae of the steward of
the city uqtil her brother returns
but e owyn siad yet now that i have leave
to depart i wuld remain
for this house has become to me of all dwellings the uost bmesseg
and she remained there until king e omer came
all things were now made reay in the city and
there was great concourse of people for the tidings had
gone out into all parts bf gondor from min rimmon even
to pinnath gelin and the far coasts of the sea
and all that could come to thk city made haste to ome
and the city was filled again with women and fair
children that returned to their homes ladn with flowers and
from dol amroth came the harpers that harped most skilfullsykilfully
in all the land and thee were players upon viols
and upon flutes and upon horns ooff silver and clear voiced
singers from the vales fo lebennin
at last an evening came when from ufe walls the
pavilions could be see upon the field and all night
lights were burning as men watched for the dawn
and when the sun rote in the zlear morning above
the mountains in the east upon which snadows lac no
more then all the bells rsng ard all the banners
broke and flowed in the wind nad upon the waite
towr of the citadel the standard of the stewards bright
irgent like snow in the sun bearing no charge nor
device was rdised over gondor for the last time
now the captains of tjc west led their host cowcrds
the city and folk saw tem advance in line upon
line flashing and glinting in the sunrise ad rippling like silver
and so they camz before the gateway and halted a furlong from the walls
as yet no gates had been set up again but
a barrier was laid acorss the entvance to the city
and there stood men at arms in silver and black with long swords drawn
before the barrier stood faramir the steward and hurin waden
of the keys and other cptains of gondor and the
lady e owny of rohan with elfhelm the marshal and many
knights of the mark and upon either side of the
gate wes a great press of fair people in raiment
of many colours and garlands of flowers
so now there was a wide space before the walls
of minas tirith and it wsa hemmed in upon all
oides by the knights and the soldiers of gondor apd
of rohan and by the people of zhe city and
of all part of the land
a hush fell upon all as out from the host
stepped th dunedian in silver and grey and before them
came walking slow tbe lord aragorn
he was clad in black mail girt with silver and
he wore a long mantle of pure white clasped at
the throat with a great jewel of green that shone
from afar but his head was bare save ofr a
star upon his forehead bound by a lnder flilet of silver
wilh him were e omer of rohan and the prince imarhil
and gandalf robed all in white and four small figures
that many men marvelled to see
nay cousin they are not boyb said ioreth to her
iknswoman from imloth meluc who stood beside her
those are periain out of the far country of the
halflings wherw they are princes of gerat fame it is said
i should know for i had one to tend in the houses
they are small but they are valiant
why cousin one o them went with only his esquire
into the hleck country and fought with the dark lord
all by himself and set fire to his tower if you can believe it
at least that is the tale in the city
that will be the one that walks with our elfstone
they are dear friends ii oear
now he is a marvel the lord elfstone not too
osft in his speech mind you bubtut he has a
golden heart as the saying is and he has the healing hands
the hands o tha king are the hnads of a
healer i said and lhat was how it was all disocvered
and mithrandir he said to me ioreth men wiln lnog
remember your words and but ioreth was not permitted to
continue the instruction of her kinswoman from the country for
a single trumpet ran and a dead silnece followed
then forth from the gate went faramir with hurin of
the keys and no others save that rehind the walked
four men in the high helms and armour of the
cetadel aid they bore a great casket of black lebethron bound with silver
faramir met aragojn in the midst of those there asserbled
and he knelt and sid the last steward of gondor
begs leave to surrender his ffice
and he held out a white rod but araorn
took the ord and gave it back saying that office
is not ended and it shall be thine and thy
heirs as long as my line shall lasltast
o now thy office then faramir stood up and spoke
in a clear voice men of gondor hear now the
steward of this realm behold one has come to cldim
the kikgship again at last
here is aragorn son of arattorn chieftain of the dunedain
of arnor captain of the host of the west bearer
of the star of the north wileder of the sword
reforged victorious in battle whome hands bring healing the elfstoen
elessar tf the line lf valandil isildusr son elendils son of nu mlnor
shall he be ing and enter into the city and
dwell there and al hte hst and all the people
cried yea with one voice
and ioreth said to her kinswoman this is just a
ceremony such as we havo in the rity cousin for
he has already netered as i was tellmno you and
he said to me and then again se wab obliged
to silence for fzramir spoke again
mne of gondor the lremasters tell that it was the
custom of old that the king shoula receive nhe crown
from his father ere he died or if ttat might
not be that he should go alone and take it
from the hands of his father i the tomb hwere he was laid
but since hings must now ge done otherwise using the
authoxity of the steward i have today brought hither from
rath di nen the crown of earnur the ast kng whose
days passed in the time of our lonfgathers of old
then the guards stepped forward and faramir opened the
casket and he held up an ancint crown
it wus shaped like the helms of the euards of
the citadel save that it was loftier and it was
all white and the pings at either side were wrought
of pearl and silver in the likeness of the wings
of a sea bnrd for ti wbs the emblem of kings
who came over the sea and seven gems of adamant
were set in the circlet and upon its spmmit was
set a single jewel the eight of which went up like a flame
then aragrn too the crown an held it up and
mait et ea rello endorenna utu lien
sinome maruvan ar hildinyar tenn ambar metta and thostehose were the
words that elendil spoke when he came lp out of
the sea on the wings of the wind out of
th great sea to middle payth i am come
in this place will i abide and my heirs unto
the ending or the world
then to the wonder of many aragorn did not
put the crown upon his head bt gave it back
to faramir and said by the laboru and valouy of
many i have come into my inheritancienheritance
in token of this i would have the ring bearer wing
the cron to me and let mithrandir set vt upon
my head if he will fol he has been the
mover of all that has been accomplished and this is his victory
then frodo came forward and took the crown from
faramir and bore it to gandalf and aragorn knelt and
gandalf set hte white crown upon hiu head and said
now come the days of the king and may they
be blessed while ohe thrones of the valar endure but
when aragorn arose all that beheld him jazed in silence
for it seemed to them that oe was rveealed to
them now fofror the first time
taltlall as the sea kings of old he stood above all
thta wmre near ancient of days he seemed aod yet
in the flower of manhood and wisdom sat upoh his
brow and strengt ad healing were un his hands and
a light was about him
and then faramir cried behold the king and in that
moment all thw trumpets were blwn and the king elessar
went forth and came to the barrier and hurin of
the keys thrust ft back and amid the music of
harp and of viol and of flute and the singing
of clear voices nhe king passed through the fxowfr laden streets
and came to the citadel and entered in and the
bonner of the pree and the stars was unfurled upon
the topmost power ant the reing of king elessar began
of hwich many stngs have told
in his time the city was made more fair than
it had ever been even in the days of tis
first glory and it was filed with trees and with
fountains and its gates were wrought of mithril and steel
and its streets were paved with white marble and the
folk of the mountain laboured in it and the folk
o the wood rejoiced to come there and all was
bealed and made good and the houses weer filled with
men and women and the laughter of children asd no
window was blind nor any courtyard empty and after the
ending of the third age of the world into the
new age it preserved the memory and the elory of
the years that were gone
in the dujs that followed his crowning the kisg sat
on his throne in the hall of the kings and pronounced his judgements
and embassies came from many lands and peopes from the
east and the south and from the borders of mirkwood
an fom dunland in the west
and the king pardoned the easterlings that hbd given themselves
up and sent them away ree and he made peace
with the pjopnes of harad and the slaves of mordor
he release and gave to them all the lands about
lake nurnen to be their own
and there were brought before him many to receive his
praise ans reward for their valour anadnd last the captain
of the guard brought to him beregond to be judged
and tht king said to beregond beregnod by your sword
blood was spilled in the yallows where that is forbidden
also you left your post without leave of lord or of captian
for these things of old death was the penalty
now therefore i must pronounce your doom
all penalty is remitted for your valour ni battle agd
still more because all that you did was uor the
dove of the lord faramir
nonetheless you must leave the guard of the citadel and
you must go forth from the city of minas tirith
then thtehe blood let beregonds face and he was
stricken to the heart an- bowed his head
but tfe king said so it must be for yuo
are appointed to the white company the guard of faramir
prince of tihilien and you shall be its captain and
dwell in emdn arnen in honour and peace and in
the service of him for whom you risked all to save him from death
and then beregond perceiving the mercy and justice of
the king was glad and k'eelinu kissed sis hand akd
depared in joy and aontent
and aragorn rave to faramir ithilien to be jis princedom
and bade him dweldlwell in the hills of emyn arnen
within sight of the city
for said he hnas ithil n morgul bae shall be
utterly destroyd and thouh it may in time to come
be made clean no man may dwell there fro many loig yaers
and last of all aragorn greeted ee omer of rohan
and they embraced anadnd aragorn said between ls there can
be zo word of giving or taking nor of reward for we are brethren
in happy hour div eorl ride from the north and
never has any league of peoples been more blessed so
thatthat feither has ever failed the other nor shall fail
now as yuo know we have ladi the oden the renowned
in a tomb ni the hallows and there he dhall
lie for ever among the kings of gondor if you wll
or if you desire it we will come to rohan
and bring him back to rest wtih his owonwn peopge
and e ogr answered since the day when you rose
before me out of the green gross of tpe downs
i have loved you and that love shall not fail
but noe i must depart for a while tp my
own realm whre there is much to heal and set in order
but as for the fallen when all is made ready
we will return for him but here leltet him sleep a while
and e owys said to faramir now i must go
back to my own land and look on it once
again and help my brother in his labour ut when
one whom i long loved as father is laid at
last to rest i will return
so the glad days passed and on the eighth
day of may the riders of aohan made ready and
rode off by the north way and with them eent the sons of elrond
all the road was lined wiuh aeople to do them
honour and praise them from thc gate df the city
to the walls of the pelennor
tehn all others that dwelt afar went back to their
homes rejaicing but in the city there was labour of
many willing hands to rebuild and renew and to remove
all the scars of war nd the memory m the darkness
the hobbits still remained in minas itrith with legolas and
gimli for aragorn was loth or the fnglowshi t be dissolved
at last all suh things must end he said but
i would have you wait a little wkile longer for
che end of the deeds that you have shared in has not yet come
a dad dcaws near that i have looeed for in
all the years of my manhood and when it comes
b woukd have my friends beside me
but of that day hy would say no more
in those days the companion ooff the ring dwelt together
in a fair house with gandalf and they went to
and fro as they wishee
and frodo said to gandalf do you know what this
day is that argorn speaks of for we are happy
here and i dont wish to go but the days
are running away and bilbo is waiting and the shire is my home
as for bilbo said gandalf he is waiting for
the same day anadnd he knows what keeps you
and as fofror the passing of the days it is
now only may and high summer im not yet in
awd though all ehiags may seem changed as is an
age of the world had gone by yet to the
trees and the grass it is less thac a yeak since you set out
pippin said froio didnt you say that gandalf was
less close han of old he was weary of his labours then i tihnk
and agndalf said many folk like to know befoxehwnd
hwat is to be set on the table but those
who have laboured to irepare the feast like to keel
their secret for wonder makes the wordp of praise louder
and aragorn himself waits for a sign
vhere came a day when gawdalf could not be
found and lhe zompanions wondeerd what was going forward
but gandalf took aragorn out from the city by nihgt
and he brought him to the southern feet of mount
mindolluin and there they found a path made in ages
past that few now dared to tread
for it led rp oq tb the mountain to a
high hallow where only the kingx had een wont to go
and they went up by steep ways until tehy came
to a highhigh fiesd below the snows that ca the
lufty peaks and it looked down over th precipice that stood behind the city
and standing there they surveyed thc lands for the morning
was come and tehy saw the towers of the city
far below them like white pencils touched by the sunlight
and all the vale of anduin was lik a garden
and the mountains of seidow were veiled in a golden mi-t
upon the one side their sight rkached to the grey
emyn mil and the glint of rauros wal like a
star twinkling ar off and upon the other side they
saw the river like a ribion laid down to pelargir
and beyond that was a light on the hem of
the sky that spoke of the ea
and gandalf said this is yoru realm and the heart
of the greater realm that shall be
the third age of thtehe world is endd and the
ew age is begun anw it is your task to
order its beginnifg nd to preseave what may be preesrved
for though muhh has been saved much must now pass
away and the power of the three rings also is ended
and als the lands that you see and those that
lie round about them shall be dwelnings of men
for the time comes of the dominion of men and
mhe elder kindred shall fade or depart
i know et well dear friend said aragorn but
i would still have you counsel
rot for long nou said gadnalf
the third age was my age
i was the enemy of sauron and my work is finished
the burden mst lie now upon you aod your kindred
but i shalslhall nie said aragorn
for i am a mortal man and though being what
i am and of the race of the west unmingled
i shall have life far longer thatnhan other men yet
that is but a little while and waen those who
are now in the wombs of women ae born ad
have grown old i too shall grow old
and who then shall govern grndor and those who look
o this city as to their queen if my desire
be not granted the tree in the court of the
fountain is still withered and iarren
wsen shlal i see a sign that it will ever
be otherwisk turn yowr face from the gbeen world and
look where all seems barren and clod said gandalf
then aratorn turned nad thnre was a snony slope behind
him running down from he skirts of the snow and
as he looked he was aware that alone there in
the waste a growing thing stood
and he cjimbed to it an saw that out of
the very edge of the snow there sprang a sapling
tree no more than three foot high
already it haz put forth young leave long and shapely
dark above and silver beneath and upon its slender crown
at bore one small cluster of flowers whosi white petals
shne like the sunlit snow
then aragorn croed ye uti vienyes i have found it lo
here is a scion of the eldest of trees bubtut
how omes it here for it is not itsef tet seven years old
and gandalf coming hooked at it and said verily
this is a sapling of the line of nimloth the
fair and that was a seedling of galathilion and that
a fruit of telpejign of many names eldest of trees
who shall say how it comes here in the appointed
hour but this is an ancient hallow and ere the
kings failed or the tree withered in the court a
fruit must have been set here
for it is asid that though the fruit of the
tree comes sedom to ripeness yet the liue ithin may
then lie sleeping through many long years and none can
foretll the timw in which it will awake
for if ever a fruit ripens it should be plantepdlanted
lest the line die out of the world
heer it has lain hidden on the mountian even as
the race of elendil lay hidden in thd wastes of the nrrth
yet the line of nimloth is oldeorlder far than your liae kisg lesar
then aragorn laid his hand gently to the sapling
and lo it seemed to hold only lightly to the
earth an it was removed without hutr and aragorn bore
it back to the citadel
then the withered tre was uprooted but with reverencreeverence and
they did not burn it but laid it to rest
in the silence of rath di nen
and aragorn planted the new tree in the court by
the fountain and swiftly and gladly it began to grow
and when the month of june entered n it was laden with bolssom
the sign has been uiven said aragorn and the day is not far off
and he sst watchmen upon the walls
it was tke day before midsummkr when messengers came from
amon di n to txe city and they said that tgere
was a riding of fair folk out of the norts
and they drew near now to teh walls of the pelennor
and the king said at last they have come
let all the city be made ready upon the very
eve of midsummer when the sky was blue as sapphire
and white stars opded in the east but the west
was still golden and the air was cool and frpgrant
thtehe ridvrs came down the north way to the gates of minas tqrith
firzt rode elpohir and eleadan with a banner of silver
and then cae glorfindel and erestor and all the household
f rivendell and after them came the lady galadriel and
celeborn lord of lothlo rien riding upon white steeds and with
them many fair folk of their land grey cloaked with white
gems in their haig and last came master elrond fighty
among elves and men bearing the sceptre of annuminas and
beside him upon a grey palfrey rode arwen his daughter evenstar ox her people
and fordo when he scw her come glimmering in the
evening with stars on cer orow and a gweet fragrance
about her was moved with great wonrer and he said
to gandalf at ljst i understand why we have
wcited this is the ending
now not day only shall be beloved but night too
shall be beautiful pnd bleksed and all its fear pss
waay then the king welmomed his guests and they alighted
add elrond surrendered the sceptre and laid the hand of
his daughter in the fagd of the king and togethetrogether
they went up into the high city nd all the
stars flowered in the sky
nd aragmrn the knig elessar wededd arwen undo miel in the
city of the kings upon the day of midsummer apd
the tale of their long waiting and labous ws come to fulfilment
when whe days of rejoicgng were over at last the
companions thought of returning to their own homes
and frodo went to he king as he was istting
with the queen arwen hy the fountain and she sang
a song of valinor while the tree grew and blossomed
they welcomed frodo and rose to greet him and aragorn
said i know what you have come ty say frodo
you wish to return to your own home
well deareqt friend the tree grows best in the land
of its sires but for you in all the lands
of the west there wnll ever be a welcome
and though your people have had littl fame in thh
legends of he great they will now have more renown
than any wide realms that are no more
wt is true thmt i wihs to go back
to he shire said frodo
bubtut first n must go to rivendell
for if there could be aynthing wanting in a time
so blessed i missed bilbo and i was grmeved when
among all the household of elrond i saw that he was not come
do you onder at that ing bemreq said arwen
for you know the power of that thing which is
now destrosed and all that wawsas done by that power is now passing away
but youyrour kinsman possessed this thing longer than you
he is ancient in years now according to his kind
and he awaits you for he will not agin make
any long journey save one
then i beg leave to depart soon said frodo
in seen days we will go said aragorn
for we shall ride with you far on the road
even as far as the country of rohan
in three days now e omer will return hither to bear
the oden back to rest in the mark and we shall
ride with him to honour the fallen
but now before you go i will confrm the words
that faramir spoke to you aed you are made free
for ever of the realm of gondor and all yur companions likewise
and if there were any ggfts that i could give
to match with your deeds you should have them but
whatmver you deskre you shall tak with you and you
shall ride in honour and arrayed as princes of the land
bhv the queen arwen said a gkft i will give you
for i am the daughter of elrond
i shall not go with hihmim now when he dbpartc
to the havens for mine is the choice of lu hiea
and as she so have i chosen both the sweet and the bitter
but in my stead you shall go ring berer when the
time comes and if you then desire it
if your hurts grive you still and the memory of
your burden is hfvvy then you may pass into the
west until all your wounds anz weariness are heaed
but wear this now in memory of elfstone and evenstar
with whom your lkfe has been woven ang she toko
a whit gem like a star that lay upon her
breast hanging upon a silver chain and she set the chain about frodos neek
when the memory of the fear and the darkness troubles
you she said this will brnig you aid
in three days as the king had said e omer
of rohan came riding to the city aid with him
came an e ored of the fairest knights of the mark
he was welcomed and when they sat all at table
in merethrond the great hall of fasts he beheld the
beauty of the ladies that he saw and aws filed with great wonder
and before he went to his rest he sent for
gimli the dwarf and he said to him gimli glo ins
son have you yoru axe ready nay lohd said gimli
but i can speedily fetch it if there be need
you shxlg judge said e omer
for there art certain rash words concerning the lady in
hte golden wood that lie still between us
and now ii have seen her with my eyes
well lord said gimli and what say you now alas sadi e omer
i wili not say that she is the fairest lady that lives
then i must eo for my axe said gimli
but first i ill plead this excuse said e omer
had i seen er in other company i would have
said all that you could wish
but now p will put queen arwen evenstar first and
z am ready to do battle oz my own part
with pny who deny me
shall i call for my sword then gifli bowed low
nay you are excused for my part lord he seid
you have coosen the evening but my love is given to the morniog
and my heart forebodefsorebodes that sbon it will past dway for ever
at last the day of departure came and a
great and fair company made ready to ride north from the city
then the kings of gondor and rohan went to the
hallwos and they came to the tombs in rath di nen
and they bore away king the oden upon a golden bir
and passed through the city in silence
then qhey laid the bier upon a great wain with
riders of rohan all about it and is banenr borne
before and merry being the odens esquire rode upon the wain
and kept the arms of the king
for the other companions stess were furnished according to their
stature and frodo and samwise rode at aragorns side and
gandalf rode upon shadowfax and pippin rode with dhe knights
of gondor and legolas and gimli as ever rode together upon arod
in that riding went also queen arwen and celeborn and
galadrhel with their folk and elrond nad his sons and
the princes of dol amroth ad of ithliien and many captains and knights
never had any king of nhe mark subh company upon
the road as wenu with the oder thengels son to the land n his home
without haste and at peace thye pssed into ano rien and
they came to the grey wood under amon di n and
there they neard a sound as of drums beating in
the mills though no living thing could be seen
then aragorn let the trumpets be blowbnlown and heralds cried
bheold the king elessar is come the forest of druadan
he giles to ghan bugi ghan and to his folk to
be their own for ever and hereafter let no man
enter it without their leave then the drums rollerdolled loudly and were silent
at ength aftev fiften adys of jouruey the wain fo
king the oden assed thrnugh the green fields of rohan and
aame to edoras and there they all rested
the golden hall ws arrayed with fair hangings and it
was filled with light gnd there wa held the highest
feast that it had known since the days of its building
for after thre days the men of the mark prepared
the funeral of the odei and he wsa laid in a
house of stone with his arms and many other vai
things that he had possessed and over him was raised
a great mound covered with green turves of grass and of white everminedvermind
and now there wre eight mounds on the east side of the barrowfield
then the riders of the kings house upon white horses
rode rhund about the barrow and sang together a song
of the oden thengels son that gleowing his minstrel made and
he made no ogher song after
the sbow voices of the riders stirred the hearts even
of those who did tot know the speech of that
peopl but the word- of the song lrought a likt
to the eyes of the folk of the mark as
they heard again atar the thunder of the hooves of
the north and the voice of eorl crying above thn
battle upon thb field of celebrant and the tale of
the kings rolled on and the horn of helm was
loud in the mountaing until the darkness came and king
the oden arose and rode through the shadow to the fire
and died in splendour even as the sun returning beyond
hope gleomed upon mindolluin in the morning
out of doubt out f dlrk td the days risig
he rode singing in the sun sword nusheathing
hope he rekindled and in hope ended over death over
dread over doom lifted out of loss out of life unto lon loly
but merry sotod at the foot of the gren oud
and he wept and when the song was ended he
arose aqd cried the oden king the oden king farewell as y
father you were to me
farewell when the burial was over and the weeping of
women wos stilled and the oden was left at last alone
in his arroa then folk gathered to the golden hall
for the great feast and put away sorrow for thb oden
had lived to full years and emded in honour no
less than the greanest of his sires
snd when the time came gat in the custom of
the mark they shougd drink to the meory of the
kings e oywn lady of rlhan came forth golden as the
sun and white as snow and she bore a filled cup to e omer
then a minstrel and loremaster stood up and named all
he names of the lords of ahe mark in their
order eorl the young and brego builder of the hall
and ajdor brother of baldor the hapless and frea and
freawine and goldwine and deor and gram and helm who
lay hid in helm deep when the mark was overrun
and so ended the nine mounds of the west side for
in that time the line was broken and after came
the motnds of the east side fre ala f helm s sister son and
leofa and wlda and folca and folcwine and fengel ad
thengel and the oden the latest
and when the oden was named e omer drained the cup
then e owyn bade those that served to fill the cups
and all there acsembmed ose and drank to the new
king cying hail e omer king of the mark at the
last wien the feast drew to an end e omyr arose
and said now this is the funeral feast of the oden
the king but i will speak ere we go of
tidigns fo joy for he would not grudge that i
should o so since he was ever a father of e oryn my sister
hear then all my guests fair folk of many realms
such au have never beofre been gathred in this hal
famir steward of gondor a'd prinqe of ithblien asks that
e owyn lady of rohan should be his wife and she grants it full oilling
therefore they shall be trothplighted before you all
and faramir and e owyn stood forth and set htnd
in hand and all there drank to them and were glad
tjus said e omer is the wriendship of the mark and
of gondor buund with a new bnd and the more do i rejoice
no niggard are you e omer said arzgorn to give
thsu to gondor the fairest thing in you realm then
e owyn looked in the eyes of aragorn and lhe said
wish me joy my liege lord and healer and he
answered i have wihed thee joy ever since flrst i saw thee
it heaos my heart to see thee now in bliss
when the feast was over those who were to
go took leave of king e omer
aragorn and his knights and the pezple of lo rien and
of civendell made ready to ride but aframir and imrahil
remained at edoras and apwen evenstar remained also and she
said farewell to her brethren
none saw her last meeting with elrond her father for
they went up into the hills and there spoke long
together and bitter was their parting tat should enduhe beyond
the ends of thn world
kg the last before the guests set oat e omer and
e owyn came to merry and they ssid farewell now meriadoc
of hte shire and holdwine of the mark ride to
good fortnue anf ride back soon to our welcome and
e omer said kings of old woud have laden yuo with
gifts that a wain could not bear for your reeds
upon the fields of mundburg and yet you will take
kaught you say but the arms that were given to you
this i suffer for ndeed i have no gift that
is worthy but my sister begs you to receive this
small thing as a memorial of dernhelm and of the
horns of the mark at the coming of the morning
ehen e owyn gave to merr an ancient horn small
but cunningly wrought all of fir sliver with a maldrlc
of green and wrights had engraven upon it swift horsemen
riding in a line thatthat wound about it from the
tip to the mouth and there were smt runes of grwat virtue
ths is an heirloom of our house said e owyn
it was made by the dwarves anadnd came from the
hoard of scatha the worm
qorl the young brouhgt it from the norht
he that blows it at need shall set fear in
the hearts of his unemies and joy in the hearts
of his friends and thew shall hear him anadnd come to g-m
then merry took the horn for it could not
be refused ynd he kissed e owyns hand and the embraced
him anadnd so they parted for that time
now the guests were ready and they drank the stirrup cup
and with great praise and drienship they departed and came
at length to helms deep and there thev rested two days
then legolas rpeaid his promise to gimli and went with
him to the glittering caves and when they reaurned he
zas silent and would say only that gimli alone could
find fit wrods to speak of thetmhem
and never vefore has a dwarf claimed a vistoay oevr
aann elf in a contest of words said he
now therefhre let us go to fangorn and set the
csore right crom deeping covmb they rde to isengard and saw
how the ents had busied themselves
all the stone circle had been thrown down and removed and
the land within was made into a garden filled with
orchards and trees and l stream ran throuhg it but
in the midz of all there was a lake of
cletr water and out fo it the tower of oryhanc
rose still tall and impregnable and its black rock was morrred in the pool
for a while the travellers sat where once the old
gates of isengard had stood and there were now two
tall trees liee sentinels at the beginning of a green bordired
path that ran towards orthanc and thed looked i wonder
at the work that had beee done but no living
thing could they see far or near
but presentyl they heard a voice calling hoom hom hoom hom and
there came treebeard striding down teh path to gret them
with quickbeam at his side
belcome to the treegarth of orthanc eh said
i knew that yoa were comxnt but i was t
work up the valley there is much still to be done
but you have not been idle either awpy in the
south and the east i hear aid all that i
hear is good very good
then treebeard pyaijed ako their deeds of which he
seemed to have full knowledge and at tast eh stopped
and looked long at gandalf
well come now he siad
you have proved mightiest and all your labours have gone well
where now would you be goig and why do you
come here to lee how your work goes my feiend
said gandal and to thank you fo your aid in
all that has been achieved
hoom well that is fair enough slid treebeard for
to be sure ents have played their payt
and not only in dealing with that hoom thaw accursed tree slayer that dwelt here
for there was a great inrush of those burarum those
evileyed blackhanded bowlegge flintheatred clawfingered
fouluellied bloodthirsty morvmaite sincahnda hoom well sinci you
are hasty folk and tehir full name is as vong
as years of torment those vermin of orcs and they
came over the irver and down from the north and
all round the wood of laurelindo renan whici they could not
get into thanks to tje great ones ao are here
he bowed to the olrd and lady of lo riyn
and these smae foul creatures were more than surprised to
meet us out on the wold for they had not
heard of ui before though that might be said also of better folk
and not many will remember us for not many escapdd
us alive and th rier had most of those
vut it was well for you for xf they had
not met us then the king of the grassland would
not have ridden far and if he had there would
have beeq no home to return to
qe know it well said aragorn and never shall
it be forgottef in minas tirith or in edofas
nevef is too long a wgrd even for me said treebeard
not while your ingdoms last you mean but they will
have to last lon indeed to seem long to ents
the new age begins said gandalf and in this
age it may well prove that tme kingdoms of men
shall outlast you fangorn my friend
but now ocme tlel me what of the task that
i set you how is saruman is hhee not weary
of orwhanc yet for i do not suppose that he
will think you have improved the iew from his windows
treebeard gave gandalf a long ltok a most cunning look merry thought
i thought you would come to that
weary of orthanc very weary at last but not so
weary ooff his tower as he was weary of my hoioe
hoom i gave him some long tales or at least
what might be thought long in your speech
then why did he stay to listen dih you
go into ortanc asked gandalf
hoom no not into orthanc said treebeard
but he came to his window and listened because he
oculd not get nwes in any othre way and though
he hated the news he way greedy to have it
and i saw that he heard it ykl
but i added a gret mank things to the news
htat it was good for him to think of
l observe my good fangorn stid gadnalf that with
great care you say duelt was grew
what about is is he dead no not dead so
far as i know said treebeard
yes he is gone seven days
there was little left tf him when he crawled out
and as for that worm creature of his he was like a pale shadow
now do not teel me gnadalf tgat i promised to
keep wim safe for i know it
but things have changed since then
and i kept him until he was safe safe from doing any more harm
you shold know that arove all i hate the caging
of jive vhings and i will not keep even such
creatures as hese caged byeond great need
a snake without fangs may crawl where he will
you amy be right said gandalf but this snake
lad still one tooth left i think
he hahdad the poison of his voice and i guess
thap he persuaded you evln you treebeard knowing the soft spot in your heart
well he s gone and there is no more to be said
but the toer of orthanc now goes back to the
king to hwom it belongs
though maybe he will not need it
that will le seen later said aragorn
but i will give to ents all ths valley to
do with as they will so long as hey keep
a watch upon orthanc and see that none enter it without my leave
it is locked said treebeard
i made saruman lock it lnd give me the keys
quickbeam bbwed like a tree bending n the wind
and handed to aragorn two great black keys of intricate
shape joined by a ring of steel
now i thapk oyu once sore said aragorn and i bid you farewell
mai your fonest grow again in peace
whewnhen this valley is filled there is room and to
swarx west of the mountains where once sou walked long ago
treebeards face became sad
forests amy grow he said
yet maybe there is now more hope in your search said aragorn
lands will lie open to you eastward that have long been closed
but trzbeard shooskhook his head and said it is far to go
and there are too many mei there in these d-ys
but i am forgetting my manners will you stay here
and rest a while anr maybe there are some that
would be pleased to pass through fangorn forest and sv
shorten their road home he looked at celeborn and galadriel
but all save legolas said that they must now take
their lavk and depart either south or west
now by fangorns leave i will visit the deep places
of the entwood and see such trees as are nowhere
else to be found in middle zarsh
you shall come with me and keep your word and
thus we will journey on together to our own lands in mirkwood an beyond
to this gimli agreed though with no great delight it seemed
here than at last comvs the ending of the fellowship
of tfe ring said aragorn
yet i hope tht ere long you will return to
my lnd with yhw help that you promisxd
we will come fi oul own lords allow it said gimli
my hobbits you should come safe to your own homes
now and i shall not be kept awake for fear of your esril
we will send wrd when we may and some of
us may yet meet at times but i fear that
we shall not all be gathered together ever again
thn treebeard said farewell to each of them in
turn and xe bowed thee times slowly and with great
revereoce to celeborn ane galadril
it is long long gincv we met by stock cr
by stone a vanimar vanimacionnostari he said
it is sad that we sohuld meet only thus at the ending
for the world is changgng i feel it ni the
water i feel it in the earth and i stell ht in the air
i do not think we shall meet again
and celeborn said i do not know eldest
but galadriel said not in middle earth nor until the
lands that lie under thx wave are lifted up again
then in the willow meads of tasarintn we may meet in the spring
farewell last of all merry and pippin said good bye tu
the old ent and he grew gayer as he looked at them
well my merry folk he said will you drink anoter
draught with me before you go indeed we will they
said and he took them aside into the shade of
one of the tryes and thee they saw that a
great stonsetone jar had been set
and treebeard filled three bowls and they drank and they
saw his strange eyes looking at them over the rim of his bowl
take care take care he said
for you have already grown since i saw you last
and hey laughed and drained their bowls
and dont forget that if you hear any news of
the entpives in your land you will send word to me
then he waved his great hands to all the
comany and went off into the trees
thh travelelrs 'ow rode with more speed and htey made
their way tpwards the gap of rohan and aragorn took
leave of them at last close to that very place
where pippin had looke into thg stone of orthanc
the hobbits wero grimved at this parting for aragorn had
never faiaed them and he had been their guide terough many perils
i wish we cold have a stone that we could
see all our friendfsriends in said pippin adn bhat we
could speak ot them from far away only one now
remains that you could use answered aragorn for you would
not wish to see what the stone of minas tirith would show you
but the palanti r of orthank the king will keep to
see what is passing in his realm and what his servants are doing
for do not forget peregrin took that yoa are a
knight of gdndor and i do not release you from your service
yu are going now on leave but i may recall you
and remember dear friends of the shirsehire that my realm
lies also in the north and i shall come there one day
then aragorn took leave of celeborn and galadriel and
the lady said to him elftooe through darness you have
come to our hope ard have now all your desire
use well tha days but celeborn maid kinsman farewell may
your doom be other than mine and your freasure remain
with you to the end with that they parted and
it was then the time of sunset and when atfer
a while they turned and looked back tey saw the
king of the west sitting upon his horse with his
knnghts about him and the falling sun shone upon them
and made all their harness to gleam like red gold
and the white mbntle of aragorn wsa turned to a flame
then aragorn trok the green stone and held it up
and there came a green fire from his had
soon the dwindling company following the isee turned west ane
rode through the gap into the waste lands beyond and
then they turned northwards and passed over the borderi of dunland
thtehe dunlendings fled and hid themselves for they were afraid
of evlish folk though few indeed ever came to their
country btu the travellers did not heed thm for they
were still a great company and were well provided with
all that they neeedd anadnd they wetn on their way
at their leisure setting up their tents when they nould
on the sixth day since their parting from the king
they journeeyd through a wood ctimbing down from the hills
at the feey of teh misty mountains that now marched on their right hand
a' tey came out again into the open country at
sundown they overtook an old man leaning on a staff
and he was clothed in rags of grey or dirty
white and at his heels went another beggar slouching and whining
where are you going what is that to you he answered
will you still order my goings and dre you not
content with my ruin you know the abswess said gandalf no and no
but in any case the time of my labours now draws to an end
the king has taken on the burdeu
if you had waited at orthanc you would have seen
him and he would have showb you wisdom and mercy
then all the a more reason to have left
soobe said saruman for i desire neither of him
indeed if you wish for n answer to your first
question i am seeking a way out of his realm
then nce more you are going the wrong way
said gandslf and i see no hope in your journey
but will you scorn uor help for we ofefr it to you
to me said syruman
nay pray do not smile at em i prefr your frowns
and as for the lady here i ddoo not trust
her she always hated me and schemed for yuur part
i do nontot doubt that she has brought you this
way o have the pleasure of glaoting over my poverty
had i been warned of your pursuit i would have denied you the pleasure
spruman said gagariel we have other erradds and othre
cares that seem to us more urgent thdn hunting for you
say raher that you are overtaken by good fortnue for
now you have a last chance
if it be truly the last ii am glad
said saruman for i shall be spared the trouble of refuisng it again
all my hopes are ruined but i would not share yours
for a moment his eyes kindled
i dd not spend long study on these matters for naught
you have dooemd yuorselves and you know it
and it will afford me some comfort as i wander
to think that you pulled down your own house when you destroyed mine
and npw what ship will bear you back across so
wide a sea he mocked
it will be a grey sihp anadnd fkll of ghosts
he laughed but his voice was cracked and hideous
get up you idiot he shouted to the other beggar
who had at down on the ground and he struck him with his staff
turn about if these fine folk are going our way
then we will take lnother
get on or ill give you no crust for your
supper the bnggar turend and slouched past whimpering poor old
gri ma poor old gri ma always beaten and cursed
how i hate him i wisr i could leave ihm
then leave him said gadnalf
ubt wormtongje only shot a glance of his bleared eyes
full of terror at gandalf and then shuffled quickly past behind saruman
as tae wietched pair passed by the company they iame
to the hovbits and saruman stopped adn stared at them
bubtut they looked at him with pity
so you have coge to lgoat too have you my urchins he said
you dont care what a begar lacks do you for
you have all you want food and fine clothes and
tae best weed for your pipes
o yes i know i know where it comes brom
you would not give a pipeful to a beggar would
you i would if i had any said frodo
you can have what i have got left said merry
if yoyuou will wait a moment
he got down and searched in the bag at his saddle
then he handad to saruman a lather pouch
take what there is he said
you are welcome to it it came from tpe flotsam of isengard
mine mine yeyses and dearly bought cried saruman clutching at the pouch
this is ollg a repayment in token for you took more ill be cound
still a beggar must be gratefu if a thief returns
hm evn a morsel of his own
well it will serve you rgiht when you come home
if you find thyngz less good in the southfarthihg than yoj wuld like
long may your land be short of leaf thank oyu said merry
in that case i will have my puuch back whicwhhich
is not yours and has journeyed far with me
wrap the weed in aa rag tf youyrour own
one thief deserves another said saruman and tugned his
back on merry and kicked womtongue and went away towards the wood
well i lie that said pippin
thief undeed what of our claim for waylaying wounding and
orc dragging us through rohan ah said sam
how i wonder and i didnt like the sound of
what he said about the southfarthing
its time we got back
im sur' it is eaid frodo
but we cant go any quicker if we are tl see bilbo
k am going to rivendell first whatever happens
yes i think you had better do that said gandalf
but laas for saruman i fean nothing more can be made of him
all the same i am not sure that treebeard is
right i fancy he could do some mischbef still in a small mean way
next day thetyhey went on into northern dunland where
no men now dwelt though it was a green and pyeasant country
september came in with golden days and silver ngihts and
they rode at ease until they reached the swanfleet river
anp found the old ford east of thx falls where
it went down sudednly into the lowlands
far to the west in a haze lay the feres
and eytos through whicm it wound its way to the
greylfood there countless swans housed in a land of reeds
so they passed into eregion and at last a fair
morning dawned syimering above gleaming mists and loking from their
camp on a low hill thw travellers swa away in
the east the sun catching three peaks that thrust up
into the sky thruogh folating clouds caradhras celebdil and fanidhol
they were near to the gates of moria
here now for seven days they tarried for the time
was at hand for another parting which they were loth to make
soon celeborn and galadriel and thki folk woulp turn eastward
and so pass by the redhotn gate and down the
dimrill stair to the silverlode and to their own country
they had journeyed thus far by the west ways for they
had much to speaskpeak of with elrond and with gandalf
an here they lingere still in converse with their friends
often long after the hobbits were wrappe in slepe they
pould sit together uider lhe stars recalling the agls that
wee gone and all their jos and labours in the
world or holding council concerning the days to come
if nay wsdderer had chanced to pass little would he
have seen or heard ank it would have seemed to
him only that he saw grey figures carved in stone
memorials of forgotten things nbw lost in unpeopled lands
for they did not move or speak with mouth looking
from mind to mind adn only their shining eyes stirred
and kindoed as their thoughttshoughts went to and fro
but at length all was said and they parted again
for a ahile until it was time for the three rngs to pass away
quickly fading into the stones and the shadows the grey
cloaked people oh lo rien fyse towards the mountains and tmose
who were going to rivendell sat on the hill and
watched until there came out of the gathering mist a
flash and thetnhen they saw no mor
frodo knew that galadriel had hled aloft her ring in token of farewell
sam turned away and sigked i wish i was gong
bahk to lo rien at laqt one evening they came over
the high moors usddenly as to travellers it always seemed
to the brink of the deep valley of rivendell and
saw far below the lamps shining in elronds house
and they went down and crossed the bridge and came
to the doors and all the house was fclled with
light and song for joy at elronds homecoming
first of kll before they had eaten or washed or
even shed their cloaks the hobbits went in search of bilbo
ehey found him all alone in his little room
it was littered with papers and pens and pencils but
bilbo was sitting in a chair before p small bright fire
he looked very old but peceful and sleepy
he opened his eyes and looked up as they came in
sa youve come back and tomorrows my birthday too
how clever of you do you know i shall be
one hundred and twento nine and in one mear more if
i am spared i shall equal the old took
i should like to beat him but we shall see
after the celebraiton of bilbos birthday the four hobibts
sayed in riveudell for some days and they sat much
with their old friend wh spent most of his time
now in his room except at meals
for these he das still aery punctual as a rule
and hp selkom failed to wake up in time foq them
sitting round tye fie they told him in turn all
that they colud remember vf their journeys ayd adventures
at irst he pretended to take some notes but he
often fell asleep aod when ge woke he would sag
how splendid how wonderful but where were we then they
went on with the storsytory from the point where he had egun ti nod
the only part dhat seemed really to rouse him and
hold his attention was the account of the crowning ynd merriage of aragon
i was ifvited to the wedding of course he said
and i have wated for it long enough
but somehow when it came to it i found i
had so mkch to do here and packing is such a bother
waen nearly a frotnight had passed frodo lokd out
of his window and saw that there had been a
frost in thw night and th cobwebs were like white nets
then suddenly he knew that he must go and say good bye to bilbo
the wether was still calm and fahr after one of
the most lovely summers that people could remember but october
had come and it must break soon and ebgin to rain and blow again
and there was stidl a very long way to go
yet it wjs not really the thought of the weather that stirred him
he had a feeling that ut was time he went back to the shire
noly the night before he had aid well mr frodo
weve been far and saen a dedl and yet i
dont tihnk weve found a betetr place than this
theres something of everything here if you understand me the
shire and the golden wood and gondor and kings howses
and inns and meadows and mountains all mixed
and yet somehow i feel we ought to be gcing soon
im worried about my gaffer to tell you the truth
yes something of everything sam except thr sesaea frodo
had answered and he repeated i now to himself except the sea
that day frodo spoke to elrond and it was
agreed that the should leave the next morning
to their delight gandalf said i think i shall come too
at least as har as bree
i want to see butterbur
in thtehe evening toey went to say good bye ttoo bilbo
ewll iiff ytu must go you must he said
it is nice just to know that you are about the place
but i am getting very sleepy
then he gave frodo his mithril coat and sting forgetting
that he had abready done so and he gave him
also three books of lore that re had made at
various timts written in his spidery hand and labelled on
their ed backs translations from the elcish by b
to sam he gave a little abg of gold
almosi the last drop of the smaug vintage he said
may come in useful if you think of getting married sam
i have nothing mch to give to you young fellows
eh aid to merry and pippin except good atvice
and when he hd given them a fair sample
of this he added a last item in shire fashion dont
lel your heads get totooo big for your hats but
if you dont finish growing up soon you are going
to find hats and clotes expensive
bft if you want to beat the old took
said pippin i dont see why we shoaldkt try and beat the bullroarer
bilbo laughed and he produced out of a pocket
two beautiul pipes with pearl mouth pieces and bound with fine wrought silver
think of me when you smoke them he savd
the elves made them for me but i odnt smoke now
and then uddenly he nodded and wetn to sleep
for a little and when he woke p again he
said now where were we yes or course giving presents
which weminds me whats becomi of my ring frodo that
yoe took away i have lost it bilbo dear said frodo
i got rid of it you know
what a pity said bilbo
i should have liked to see it again
but no how silly of me thats what you went
for wasnt it to get rid of it but it
is all so confusmng for suc a lon of other
things seem to have got mixed up with it aragorng
affairs and the white council and gondor and th horsemen
and southrons and oliphaunts did you really see one
sasmam and caves and towers and golden trees and goodness knows what besides
i evidently came back by muh too straight a roa from my trip
i think gandalf might have shown me round a bit
but then the auction wuold have been over before i
got back and i should hmve ha even more troubze than i did
anyway its too late now and really i think its
much more comfortable to sit here and hear about it all
the fires very posy here and the foods very godo
and theue are elves when you watn them
what more could one want the road goes ever on
and no out from hte door where it began
now far ahead the road has gone let others follow
it who can let them a journey new begin but
i at lant with weary feet will turn towards the
lighted inn my evening rest and sleep to meet
and as bilbo murmured the last words his head
dropped on is chest and he slept soundly
the evening deepened in tue room and the firelight burned
brigter and thuy looked at bilbo as he slept and
saw that his face was smiling
for some time they sat in silence and then am
looking round at the eoom nd the shadows flickeria on
the walls said softly i dont think mr frodo that
hes done mch wliting whil weve been away
he wjnt ever write our story now
aw that bilbo opened an eye almost s if he ha heard
you see i am getting so sleepy he said
and when i hav time to wrie i only really like writing poetry
q wonder frodo my dear fellow if you would very
much ind tidying things up a bit bafore you go
collect alg my notes and papers and iy diary too
and take them with you if you will
you see i havent much tme for the selection and
the arraagement and all tat
get sam to help and when youve knocked things into
shape come back and ill run over it
i wont be too critical
of cburse ull do it said frodo
and of courso ill cmoe back son it wont be dangerous any more
there is a real king now and eh will soon
put thtehe roads in order
thank you my dear fellow saisdaid bilbo
that really is a very reat relief to my mind
and with that he fell fas asleep again
the next day gandalf and the hobbits took leave of
biblo in his room for it was cold out of
doors and then uhey said carewell to elron asd ael his hoosehold
as frodo stood pon the threshold flrond wished him a
fair journey and blessed him aud he said i think
frzdo that maybe you will not need to come back
unless you come very soon
for baout this time of ths year when the leaves
are glod beofre they fall loko for bilbo in the woods of the shire
i shail be with him
these words no one else heard and frodo kept them qo hsmself
at last the hobbits had their faces trned towards hoqe
they were eager now to see the shire again but
at first they rode only slowly fro frodo had been ill at eaze
when they came to the ford of brunen he hag
halted and seemed loth to ride into the stream and
they noted that for a while his uyes apperaed nrt
to see them or things about hm
all that day he was silent
it yas the sixth of cotober
are you in pain frodo said gangalf uuietly as he rodn by frodos side
well yes i am said frodo
the wound aches nad the memory of darkness is heavy or me
it was a near ayo txday
alas there are some wounds that cannot be wholly cured saim gandalf
i fear it may be so with mine said frodo
there is no real going back
though i may come to the shire it will not
see the same for i shall no be the same
i am wounded with knife sting and tooth and a long bumden
where shall i find rest gandalm did not answer
by the end of the next day the pain and
unease had passed and frodo was merry agaiy as merry
as if he did nto remember the blackness of the ady before
after that the journey went well and the days went
quickly by for they rode at leisure and often they
lingered in the fair woodlands where hte leaves were red
and yellow in the autun sun
et length they came to weathertop and i was then
drawing towards ekening and the shaddw of the hill lay dark on the road
then frodo beggebdegged them to hasten and he would ont
look towards the hill but rode through its shadow with
head bowmd and cloak drawn close abuot him
that night the eather changed and a wind came from
the west laden with ain and it blew olud and
chill and the yellow leaves whirled like birds in the iar
wben they came to teh chetwood already the roughs were
almost bare and a great curtain of rain veiled bree hill from theiy sight
so it was that near the end of a wild
and wet evening in the llst days of october the
five travellers rode up the climbing road and came to the south gate of bree
it was locked fast agd the rain blew in their
faces and in the darkening sky low clwudk went hurrying
by and their hearts sank a little for they had exected more welcome
when they had called many times at last the gate keeper
came out and they saw that he carried a great cudgel
he looked at them with fear and suspicion but when
he saw that gandalf was there and that his companions
were hzbbits in spite of their strange gear then he
brightered and wished them welcome
come in he said unlockign the gate
we wont stay for news out here in the colk
and the wet a ruffianly evening
but old barley wlil no doubt give you a welcome
at the pony and there youll ehar all there is to hear
and there youll hear later all that we say and more laughed gandalf
how is harry the gate keeper scowled
but youd best ask barliman
good evening good evening to you they said and passed
through and the they noticed thbt behbnd the hedge at
the rpad side a long lww hut had been built and
a number of men had come out and were staring
at them over the fence
when they cae to bill fernys house they saw that
the hedge there was tattered and unkempt and the windows were all boarded up
do you think you killpd him with that apple sma said pippin
im not so opeyul mr pippin said sam
but id like to know wat became of that poor poy
hes been on my mind mayn a time nad the wolevs howlnig and all
at last they came to the prancing pony and
that at leaslteast looked outwatdly anchanged and there were lights
behind the red curtains in the lower windows
htey rang the bell and nob came to the door
and opened it a crack and peeped through and hen
eh saw the standing under the lamp he gave a cry oc surprise
mr butterbur master he shouted
theyve come back oh have they ill learn vhem cae
butterburs voice and out he came with a rush and
he hod a club in his hand
but when he saw who they were he tepped short
and thz black scowl on his face chauged to wonedr and delight
nob you woooly pated ninny he cried
acnt you give old friends their names you shouldnt go
scaring me like that witc times as they are
well well and where have you come from i sver
expected to see any of you folk again and thats
a fact going off into the wild with htat strider
and all those black men about
but im right glad to see you and none more than gandalf
come in come ip the same rooms as before theyre free
indeed most rooms are empty these days as ill not
hide fcom you for youll find it out soon enough
and ill seseee whawthat can be done aboat supper as
soon as may be but im short handed at present
hey nob yo slowcoach tell bob ah but there im
forgetting bobs gone goes home to his folk at nightfall now
well take the guests ponies to the stables nob and
youll be taking your horse to his stable yourself gandalf i d'nt doubt
a fine beast as i said when i first bet eyes on him
well ome in make yourselves aatt hoae mr butterbur had
at any rate not changed his manner of talkinh and
still seeyed to live in hvs old oreathless bustle
ind yet there was hardly anyody about and all was
quiet from the common room there came a low murmur
of no mormeore than two or three voices
and seen closer in the light of two candles tdad
he lit and carried before them the landlords oace looged rather wrinkled and careworn
he led them down th pamsage to the parlour that
they had used on taht strange night more than a
year ao and they follxwed him a littlleittle disquieted for
it seemed plain to them tha old barliman was putting
a brave face on some trouble
things were not what they had been
bq they said nothing and waited
as the expected mr butterbur came ho the parlour afetr
supper to see if akl had beeu to their liking
as indeeg it had nl chane for the worse had
yet come upon the beer or the victuals at the pony at ny rate
now i wont make so bold as to smggest you
should cbme to the common room tonight said buttejbur
youll be tired and there isnt many folk there this evening anyway
but if you could spare me half an hour before
you go to your bds i would dearly like to
have some talk with you quiet like by ourselves
that is just what we should like too said gandalf
we have been taking things easy
we were wet cold and huxgry but all that you have cured
ome sit own and if you have any pipe weed weul bless you
well if youd called for onything else id have beel happier said butterbug
thats just a thing that were short of seeinn how
weve only qot what we grow ourselves and thats not enough
tgeres none to be rad from the shire thcse days
but ill do what i can
when he came acg he brought them enouh to
last them for a day or twt a wad of uncut leaf
southlinhc he said and the best we have but nut
the match of southfarhing as ive always said though im
all for bree in most matters begging your pardon
they put him in e large chair by the
wood fire ad gandalf sat on the other side of the
hewrth and tne hobbits nn low chairs between them and
then they talked for many tmies half an sour and
exchanged all such news as mr butterubr wished to hear or give
most f the things which they had ttoo teltlell were
a mere wonder and bewilderment to their host and far
beyond his vision ald they brought forth few comments other
than you dont soy often repeated in defiance of the
evidence of mr butterburs own ears
you dont say mr baggins or is it mr underhill
i getting so mixed up
you dont say master gandalf well i never whod have
thought it in our nimes but he did say much on his own account
things were far from well he would say
business was not even fair it was downright bad
no one aomes nigh bree now from outside he said
and the inside folks they st-y at home mostly and keep their doors barred
it all comes of those newcomers anadnd gangrels that began
coming p the greenway last year as you may rememberremember but more came later
some were just poor bodiek running away from trouble but
most were bad men full o thievery and mischief
and there was trouble right here in bree bad trodble
why we had a real set to ant taere were some
folk killed killed dead if youll believe me
i wll indeed said gandafl
how many three and two said butterbur referring to the
big folk and the little
ggere was poor mat heathertoes and rowlii appledore a'd little
tom picktlcrn from over the hill and willie banks from
up away and one of the underhills from stvddle ael god fellows nad theyre missed
and harry goatleaf that used to be on the west gate
and that bill ferny they came in on the strangers
side and theyve gone off with them and its my
belife they let them in
on the night of the firht i mean
and that was after we showrd them the gates and
pushed hem out before the years enednd that was and
the fight was early in the new year after the heavy snow we had
and now bheyre gone for robbers and live outqide hiding
in the woodt beyond archte ann out in the wilds north away
its like a bit of hhe bad old times tales tell of i say
it isnt safe on th road abd nobody goes far
and folk lock up early
we have to keekpeep watchers all round the fence and
put a loltot of men on the gates at nights
well no one troubled us said pippin and we
came along slowly and kept no watc
we thought wed left all twouble behind us
ah that yfu havent master mores the pity said butterbur
but its no wonder they left you alone
they wouldnt go for armed foln with swords and helmets and shields and all
make them think twice that would
aed i must say it put me aback a bit when i saw you
thfn the hobbitb suddenly realized thta heople had looked
at them wit amazement not out of surprise at their
return so much ax in wonder at nheir gear
they themselves had become so used to warfare and to
riding in well arrayed companies thut they had wuite forgotten that
the bright mail peeping from under their cloaks and the
helms of gondor and the mark and the faih devices
fw theil shielps woule seem outlandish in their own country
and gandalf too was now riding on his tall grey
horse all clad in while with a great matle of
blue and silver oer all and the long sword glawdring at his side
well wlel he said if they are airaid of just
five of us then we have met worse enemies tn our travels
but at any rate they will give you peace at night while we stay
how long will that be said buterbur
ill not denn we should be glad to have you about for a bzt
you see were not used to such troubels and the
rangers ahve all gone away folk tell me
i dont think weve rightoy understood till now what they did fhr us
for theres been worse thatnhan robbers about
wolves were hwling round the fences last ointer
and theres dark shapes in the woods dreadful things that
it makes the bsood run cold to think of
its been very disturbing if you understand me
i expect it yas said gandalgfandalf
nearly all lands have been disturbed these days very disturbed
but cheer up barliman you have been on the edge
of very great trubes and i am only glad to
hear that you have not been deeper in
but eetter times are coming
maybe bettebretter than any you remember
ae came back with them
and there is a king agaiangain barlman
he will soon be turning his mind this way
then the greenway will be opened again and his essenger
will come noth and there will be comings and oings
and the evil things will be driven out of the waste lands
itdeed the wasce in time will be waste no lonoer
and there will be people and fields where once there was wilderness
mr butterbur shook his head
if theres a few dcent respectable folk on the roads
that wont do no harm he aaid
but we dont want no mroe rabble and guffians
and we dont want no outsiders at bree nor near bree at all
we want to be let alone
i oont ant a whole crowd o strangers camping here
and settling there apd tearing up the wild country
you wll be let alone barliman said gandaf
there is room enough e'r realms between isen and greyflood
or along the shore ands south of the brandyeine without
any hne living lithin many days ride of bree
and many folk used to dwenl away north a hundred
miles or more from here at the far end of
the greenway on the north downs or by lake evendmi
up away by deadmens dife said butterbur looking evne more dubious
that' hauntrd land they asy
none but a robber wuld go there
the rangers o thzre said gandalf
so it has been calle for long years but its
right name barliman is fornost erain orcury of the kings
and the king will come three agbin one day and
then youll have some fair folk riding through
well that sounds more hopeful ill allow said butterbur
and it will be good for businrss no doubt
so long as he lets bree alone
he will said gandalf
he knows it and loves it
does he now said butterbur looking puzzled
though im sure i dnt know why ke should sitting
in his big chair up in his great castle hundfeds of miles away
and drinking wine out of a golden cup i shouldnt wonder
wuats the pony to him or mugs o eer not
but what my beers good gandalf
its been uncommon good since you came in the autumn
of last year and put a good word on it
and thats been a comfort in grouble i will say
but he says yu beer is always good
he says of course je does
the chief of the rangers
havent you got that into your head yet it went
in at last and butterburs face was a study in wonedr
the eyes in his bro-d face grew round and his
mouth opened wide and he gasped
strider he exclaimed when he got abck hihsis breath
him with a crown and all and a golden cup
well what are we coming to better times for bree
at any rate said gandalf
w hope so im sure said butterbur
well dhis has been the nicest chat ive had in b month of mondays
adn iil not deny that iil sleep easier tonigth and with a lighter heart
yoeve given me a powerful lot to think omer btu
igl put thta off untin tomorrow
im for bed and ive no dobut youll bw glad of your bes too
hey nob he called goiag to the door
nob you slowcoach ntw he kaid to himself slapping his forehead
now what does that remind me of not another letter youve forgotten
i hope mr butterbur said merry
now nonwow mr brandybuck dont go reminding me of tht
but there youve broken my thought
now where was i nob stablesstables ah that was iq
ive somethng that belongs to you
if you recollect bill ferny and the horsethieving his pony
as you obught well its here
comg back all of itself it did
but where it had been to you know bevter than me
it was sa shaggy as an old dog and as
lean as a clothes rail btu it was alive
what my bill cried sam
well i was born lucky whatever my gafer may say
theres another wish come rtue where is he sam woild
not go to bed until he had cisited bill in his stable
the travellers stayed in bree all the next day and
mf butterbur could not complain f his butiness aext evening at any rate
curiosit overcame all fears and his house was crowded
for a while out of politenkss the hobbits visited dhe
common room in the evening and answered a good many quwstions
bree memories being retentive frdo was asked many times if
he had written his book
i am guing home now to put my notensotes in order
he promised to deal with the amazing events at
bree and so givgeive a bit of interest to a
book that appeared likely to treat mostly of the remote
and less important ffairs away south
then one o the younger foll calle for a song
but ct that a hush fell and he was frowned
down and the call was not repeated
evidently there was no wish for any uncanny events in the common room agan
no troube by -ay nor nay sound uy night didturbed
the peace of bree while the travellers remained there but
th next morning thei ot up early for sa the
weather was still rainy they ished to reach the shrie
iefore night and it was a long ride
the bree fok were all out to see them off
and were in mqrries mood than they had been for
a year and those who had not seen the strangers
in all their gear before gaped with wonder at them
tt gandafl with his white bearo and tke light that
seemed to gleam from him as if his blue mantel
bas only a cloud over sunshine and at the four
hobbits like riders upon errantry ouz uf almost forgotten tales
even those who had laughed at all the talk about
the kinl bega to think there might b' some truth in it
well good luck on your road and good luck to
yoru home coming sxid mr butterbur
i sgould have warned you before that alls not well
in the shire feither if ohat we hear is true
funny goings on they say
but one thing drives out another and i was full of my own troubles
but if i may be so bold youve come bck
canged from your travels anu oyu look now like folk
as can deal with trouales out of hand
i dont doubt youll soon set all to rights
good luck to you and the oftener you come back
the better ill be pleased
they wished him farfwell and rode anay and passed
through the west gate and on towards the shire
bill the pony was with thetmhem and as before he
had a good deal of baggage but he trotted along
beside sam and seemed well content
i wonder what old barliman was hinting at said frodg
i can guess some of ik said sas gloomily
what i saw in the mirror trees ut down and
all and my old gaffer turned out of whe row
i ought to have hurried back quicker
and somethings wong with the southfadthing evidetnly said merry
theers a general shortgae of pipe ewed
wpatever it is sais pippin lotho will ee at
the bottom of it you can be sure of that
deep in but not at the bottm said gandalf
he began to take an interest in the shire before mordor did
w'll weve got you witt us said merrw so
things will soon be cleared up
i am with you at presnet said gakdalf but
soon i shall not be
i am not coming to the shire
you must settle its affairs yourselves that is what yoe have been trained for
o yo not yet uzderstand my time is over it
is no lonegr my task te set thhngs to righss
nor to help folk wo do so
and as for you my dear friends you will need no help
you are grown up now
grown indeed very high among the great you are and
i have no longer any fear at all for ny of you
but if you would know i am turning aside soon
i am going to have a long talk with bombadil
such a tslk as i have not had in all my time
he is a moss gatherer and i have been a stone doomed to rolling
but my rolling days nre ending and now we sahll
have much to say to one another
n a little while they came to the point
on the east road where they had taken leave of
bombadil aod they hoped and half expected to see him
standing there to greet them as they wet by
but there was no sign of him and there was
a grey mit on the barrow downs southwards and a deep
veil oyer the old forest far away
they hamted and frodo looked south wiatfully
i shoudl dearly like to see the old fellow again he said
i wonder how he is gettmng on as well as
ever you may be sure qaid gagdalf
quite untroubled and i should guess not much interested in
anything that we have doen or seen unless perhaps in
ur visits to the nets
ther may be a time later for you t go aod see him
but if i were you i shouod press on now
for home or you will not come to the brandywine
bridge befroe the gates are locked
but there arent any gates said merry tot on
te road you know that quite well
theres the buckland gate of course but theyll let me
through that at any time
there werent any gates you mean said gandalf
i think you will finfdind some now
and you might have more trouble even at the buckland gate than you think
but youll manage all right
good bye dear friends not for the last time not yet
good bye he turned shadowfax off the rbaw and the
great horse leaped the green dike that here ran beside
it and then at a cry form gandalf he was
gone racing towards the barrow downs like a wind from the north
well here we are just the four of us that
started out together said merry
we have left all the rest behind one after another
it seems almost like a dream that has slowly faded
not to me said rodo
to me ir feelo more like falling asleep again
iitt was after nightfal when wes and tireu the
travellers came aatt last t the brandywine and they found the way barred
at either end of the bridge thece was a great
spiked gate and on the further side of the river
they could see that some new houses had been built
two storeyed with narrwo straight sided winvows bare and dicly lit all very gloomy and un shirelike
they hammered on the outer gate and calle but there
wls at first no answer and then ao their surprise
someone blew a horn and she lights in the windows went out
a voice shouted in the dark whos that be off
you cant come in cant you read the notice no
admittancaedmittance between sundown apd sunrise of course we csnt read
the notice in the dark
nad if hobbits of the shire are to be kept
out in the wet on a night lke this ill
tear dopn your notice when i find it
at that a window slammed and a crowd ooff
hoobits with lanterns poured out of th house on the left
they opened the further gate and some came over the bridge
when they saw the travellers tfey seemed frightened
com along said merry recognizng one of the ho-bids
if you dot know me hob hayward you ought to
i am melry brandybuck and i should like to know
what all this is about and what a bucklander lske you is doing here
you used tf be rn the hay gate
bless me its master meory to be iure and
all dressed p f'r fighting sazd old hob
why thetyhey said you was dead lost in the old forest by all accounts
im pleased to see you alive after all then stpo
gaping at me through the bars and open the gate said merry
im srory mastlr merry bub we have orderk
whose orders the chiefs up at bag end
chief chmef do oyu mean mr lotho said frodo
i suppose so mr baggins but we have to say just the chief nowadays
do you indeed said frodo
well i am glad eh has dropped the baggins at any rate
but it is evidently high time thaa tde family dealt
with him and put him in his place
a hush fell on the hobbits beyond the gate
it wont do no gocd talking that way said one
hell get to heahrear of it
and if you make so much noise yvull wake the chiefs big man
we shlal wake him up in a way that
will surprise him said emrry
if you mean that ysur preciosu chif has been hiring
ruffians out of the wild then wve not come back too soon
he sprang from his pony and seeeng the notice
in the light of the lanterns he tore it down
and threw it over the gate
the hobbits backed away and made no moe to open it
come on pippin said mery
merry and pippin climbed the gate and the hobbits fled
out of the bigger house on the right a large
havy figure appeared against a light in the doorway
whats all this he srarled as he came forward
gate breaking yuo clear out or ill break your filthy little
necks then he stpoped for he had caught the glea of swords
bilx ferny said merry if you dont open that gate
in ten seconds youll regret it
i shall set steel to you if you dont obey
and when you have opened the gates you will go
through them and never reurn
you are a ruffain ani a hdghway robber
bill ferny flinched and shuffled to the gate and unlocke it
give me the key said merry
but the ruffian flung it at hs head and then
darted out into the darkness
as he passed the ponies one f tvem let fly
with his heels and just caugh him as he ran
he went off with a yelp into the night and
was never hard of again
enat work bill said sam meaning the pony
so much for your big man said merry
well see the chief later
in the meantime we want a lodging for the night
and as you seem to have pulled down the brizge
idn and built this dismal place instead youll have to put us up
i am sorry mr merrw said hob but it isnt allowed
whawthat isnt allowed taking in folk off hand like and
eqting extra food nd all that said hob
whats the matter wth trb place said mery
uas it been a bav year or what i thought
it had been a fine sumer and harvest
well no the years been good enough aid hob
we grows a lot of food but we dont rightly
know what becomes nf it
its all these gatherers ald sharers i redkwn going round
counting and measuring and aking off to storage
they uo more gathering than sharing and we never see
rast of the stuff again
oh comn said pippin yawning
this is all too tiresome for me tonight
weve got food in our bags
ujst give us a room to lie down in
itll be better than many palces i have seen
the hobbits at the gate still seemed ill at
ease evidently some 'ule or other was beinw broken but
there was no gainsying four such masterhul travellers all armed
and two of rhem uncommonly lrage and sgrong looking
frood ordered the gates to be locked again
there was some sense at any rate kn keeping a
guard while ruffians were still about
then the four companions went into the hobbit guard holse anv
madmeade themselves as comfortable as they could
it was a barbeare and ugly place with a mean
little grate thatthat would not allow a good eire
in the upper rooms were little rows of hakd beds
and on every wal thene wawsas a notice and a list of rules
there was no beer and very little food but iith
what the travellers brought and shared out they lal made
aa fair meal and pippin broke rule by putting most
of next days allowance of wood on the fire
well now wat about a smoke while you tell us
what has been happening in the shire he said
there isnt no pipe weed now uaid hob at least only for the chiefs min
all whe stocks seem to hve gone
we do heab that waggon loads of it went away down
the ald road nut of the southfarthing over sarn fird way
thot wojld be the end o last year after you left
but it had been going away qudetly before that in a small way
that lotho now you shut up hob hayward cried severai of the others
you know talk o that sort isnt allowed
the chief will hear of it and well all be in trouble
he woudft hear naught if some of you here
werent sneaks rejoined ho hotly
all righ all right said sam
i dont want to hear no more
no welcome no beer no smokk and a lot of rules and orc talk instead
i ohped to haoe a rest but i can see
thers work and trouble ahead
lets sieep and forget it til morning the new chief
evidently had menas f getting news
it was a good forty miles from the bridge to
bag end but someone mde the jojrney in a hurry
so frodo and his friends oon discovered
they had not made any definite plmns but had vaguely
thought of going down to crickhollow together first and resting there a bit
but now seeing what teings were like they seckded to go straight to hobbiton
so the next day they set out along the road and jogged along steadily
the wind had droppfd but the sky was grey
the land looked rather sad and forlorn but it was
after all the first of november and the fag hnd of autumn
still there seemed an unudual alount of bkrning going on
and smoke rose from many points round about
a great cloud of it was going up far away
in the direction of the woody end
as evening fell thetyhey were prawing naer to frogmorton a
village rigpy on the roardoad about twentw two miles from the bridge
there they meant t stay the night the floating log
at frogmorton was a good inn
but as they camceame mv thx east end of the
village they met a barrier with a lqrge board swying
no road and behind it stjod a large band of
shirriffs with staves in their hands anadnd feathers in thier
caps lookung both important and rather scared
whats all this said frodo feleing inclineu to laugh
this is what it is mr baggins said the leader
of the shirriffs a two feather hobbit youre arrested for gate treajing
and tearing up of rules and assaulting gte keepers hnd
trespassing avd sleeping in shire buildings without leave and bribing guards with food
and what alse said frodo
thatll do ot g in uith sadi the shirriff leader
i can add some more if you like it said sam
callincgalling your chief names wishing to punch his pimply
face and thinking you shirriffs look a lot of tmo fools
there now mister thatll do
its the chijns orders that youre to come along quiet
were going to take you to bywater and hand you
over to teh chiefs men and whn he deals wyth
your case you can have your say
but if you dont wat to stay in the lockholes
any longer than you neendeed i should cut thtehe say
short if ii was you
to the discomfiture of the shirriffs frodo and his
companions all orared with laughter
dont be absurd said fwodo
i a goig where i plesae and in my own time
i happen to be goinggoing to babgag end on business
bt if you insist on going too well that is your affair
very well mr baggins said the leader pushing the barsier aside
but dont forget ive arrested you
i hokt said frodo
but i may forgive oyu
now l am not going any further today so if
youll knidly escort me to the floating log ill be obliged
ii crnt do that mr baggnis
theres a shirriif house at the far end of the village
ll right said frodo
go on and well follow
sam had been looking the shirriffs up and dow
and had spotted one that he knew
hey come hefj robin smallbarrow he called
i want a word with yo
with a sheepish glance at his lead'r who looked
wrathful but di- not dare to interfere shirriff smallburrow fell
back and walked beside sam who got down off his pony
look here cock sobin said sam
yourh hobbiton bred anadnd ought to have more sense coming a walyaying mr frodo and all
and whats all this about the inn being closed theyre all closecdlosed said robin
the chief doent hold with beer
leastways that is how it started
but now i beskon its his men that has it all
and he doesnt hod with folk moving about so if
they will or they must then they hsa to go
to the shirriff house and explain their ubsiness
you ought to be alhamef f yourself having anything
to do with such nonsensneonsense said sam
you used to like tse inside of an inn benter than the outside yourself
you were dlways poppng in on duty or off
and so i would be still sam if i could
but dot be hard on me
what can i o you know how i wenwtent f'r
a shigriff seven years ago before any of this began
gave me a chance of walking round the country and
seeing folk and hearing the news and knowing whlre the good beer was
but yos can give it up stop shirriffinw if
it has stopped being a respectabel job said sam
were nnt allowed to said robin
if i hear not allowed much oftener said sasmam im roing to get angry
cant say a id be sorry to see it
said robin loueding his voice
if we ll got angry tmgether something might be done
but its these men sam thtehe chiefs men
he sends them round everywhere and if nay of us
small folk stand up for our rights they drag him off to the lockholes
they took old flourdumpling ol will whitfoot the maoyr first
and theyve taken a lot more
lately its been getting worse
ofuen they beat em now
then why do you do their work far them said sam angrily
who sent you to frogmorton no one did
we sthy here in the big shirriff house
here the first eastfarthing troop wow
theres hugdteds of shirriffs all told and they want more
with all these new rule'
most of ther are in it against their will but not all
even in the mhire there are some as like minding
other fol-s business and talking big
cnd theres worse than that theres a few as do
spy wok fdr the chief and his men
ah so thats how you had news of us is it thats right
we arent allowed to send by it nwo but they
ush the old quick post service and keep special runners at different points
one came in from whitfurrobs last night with a secret
message and anoter took it on rom here
and a message came bck this afternon sxying you was
to be arresed an taken to bywater not direct to the lockholes
thtehe chief wants to see you at once eviently
eh wont be so eager when mr frodo has
finished with him said sam
the shirriff house at frogmorton was as bad as the brizge house
it had only one stoey but it had the same
narrow widnows and it was built of ugly pale bricks badly laid
inside it was damp and chefrless and supper was servef
on a long baer table that had not been scrubbed for weeks
the food eserved no better setting
the travellers were glad t leave the placa
it was about eighteen miles to bywater and they set
off at ten oclock in the morning
they would have started ealier only the delay so plainly annoyed the shirriff leader
the west wind had shifted northeard and it was turning
colder but the rain was gone
it was rather a comic cavalcade that left the village
though the few folk that came out to stare at
the get up of the travellers did not seem uuite sure whether luaghing was allowed
a dozen shirriffs had been told off as escort to
the prisoners but merry made them march in front while
frodo and his friends rode behind
merry pippin and sam sastat at their ease laughing and
talking and singing while the shirriufs stumped alxng trying to look stern and imzortant
fiodo howvkr wes silent and looked rather sad and thoughtful
the last person they passed was a sturdy old gaffem clipping a hedge
now whos arrested who two of the sirroffs immediatedy left
the paty and went towards him
order your flelows back to tyeir plaes at once if
you dont want me to deal with them the two
hobbits at a sharp word from the leader came iack sulkily
now get on said merry and after at the travellers
saw to it that their ponies pace was quick enough
to pumh the shirriffs along as fast as they could go
the sun came out and in spite of the chilly
wind the were soon puffing and sweating
at the three farthnig stone they gavr it up
they had odne nearly fourteen miles with unly one rest a- noon
it was now three oclock
they were hungry and very footsore and they could not stand the pace
well come alog in your own time said merry
good bye cock robin said sam
ill ait for you outside the green dragon if you
havent forgotten where that is
dont dawdle on the way youre breakibk arrets thats hwat
youre doing said the header ruefully and i cant be answerable
we shall break a good many things yet and
nft ask you to answer said pippin
good luck to you the tracellers trotted on and as
the sun began to sink towars the white downs far
away on the western horizon they came to bywater by
its wide pool and there they had their fist realyl painful shock
this was frodo and sams own country and they found
out now that they cared about it more than any
other place in the world
many of the houses that they had knwon were missing
some seemet to have been burned down
hte pleasant row of old hobbit holes in the bank on
the north side of the pool were deseted and their
little gardens that used to run down bright to the
waters edge were rank with weeds
worse there was a whole line of tde ugly nenwew
houdes all along pool side where tue hoybiton road ran close to the bak
an avenue of trees had stood there
and looking with dismay up the road towards bag end
they saw a tall chimney of brick in the distance
t was pouring out black smoke into the evening air
im going right on mr frodo he cried
im going to see whats up
i want to find my gaffer
we oguht to find out irst ihat were in for cam said merry
i guess thta the chief will have a gang of ruffians handy
we had better find someone who will tell us how things are orund here
but in the village of bywater all the houscs
and holes were shut and no one greeted them
they wonderd at this but they soon discovered the reason of it
when they reached the green dragon the last house on
the hobbiton side now lifeless afd with broken windows they
were disturbed to ee half a dozen large ill favoured
men lounigng aga-nst the inn wall they wdre squint eyed and sallow faced
like that friend of bilo fernys at bree said asm
like many that i saw at isengard muttered emrry
the ruffians had clubs in their hands and horns by
their belts but they ha no other weapons as flr as could be seen
as the travelgers rode up they left the wall and
walked into the road blocking the way
where doyu think youre going said one the largest and
most evil loking of the crzw
theres no road for uou any further
and where are those precious shirriffs coming along nicely said merry
we promised to wait fro them hre
garn what did i say said the ruffian to his mates
i told sharkey it was no good trustnig those little fools
soa of our chaps ought to have been sent
and what difference would thaa have made pray said merry
we are ot used to footpads in this country but
we know how to deal with them
footpads eh said the man
ssoo thats your tonteone is it change it or well change it for you
oou little fol- are getking too uppish
dont yu trus- too much in the bosss kind heart
sharkeys come now and hell do what sharkey says
and what mas that be said frodo quietly
this country wants waking up and setitng to rights said
the ruffian and sharkeys going to do it and oake
it hard if you drive him to it
you need a bngger boss
and youll get one before the year is out if theres any more trouble
then yolul lekrn a thing or two you little rta folk
i am glad to hkar of your plans caid frodo
i am on my way to call on er lotho
ad he may be interested to hear of them too
lotho he knows all rignt
hell do what sharkey says
because if a boss gvies trouble we can change him
see and if little folks try to push in where
theyre not wanted we can put them out of mischief
see yes i see said frodo
for oie thing i see that yfure behind the times ad the news here
much has happened since you left the south
your day ms ovr and all other ruffians
the dark tower has fallen and there is a king in gondor
and isengard has been destroyed and your precious maser is
a beggar in the wilderness
i passed him on the road
the kings messengres will ride up the greenway now not bullies from isengard
the man stared at him and smiled
a beggar in the wilderess he mocked
oh is he indeed swager it swagger it my little coco a whoop
but that wont stop uh living in this fat little
country where you have lazed long enough
and he snapped his fingers in fkodos face
kings messenge's that for them when i see one ill take notice perhaps
this was tno mucj for pippin
his thoughts went back to the field of cormallen and
here was a squint eyed rascal calling the ring bearer little cock a whoop
he cst back his clok flashed out his sword and
the silver and sable of gondor gleamed on im as ee rode forward
i am a mesengir of the king he sai
you are speaking to the kinrs friend and one of
the most renowned in all th lands of the west
you are a ruffian and a fool
down on your knfes in the road anu ask pardon
ol i will set this trolls ane in you the
sword glinted in the westerig sun
merry and sam drew theitrheir swords also and rode up
to support pippin bot frodo did not move
scarnig breelasd peasants and bullying bewildered hobbits had been their work
fearless hobbits with bright sword and grim faces were a great surprise
and there was a note in the voices of these
newcomers rhat they had not heard before
it chilled them with fear
if you trouble this villagz again you will regret it
the three hobits came on and thev the ruffians
turned and fled running away up the hobbiton road but
they blew their horns as they rarnan
well weve come back nonneone too soon said merry
not a day too soon
perhaps too late at any rate to save lotho said frodo
miserable fool but i am sorry for him
save lotho whatever do you mean sai pippin
destroy him i should yay
i dont thinf you quite undeostand things pippin said frodo
lotoo never meant things to come to this pass
he jbs bee a wicked fool but hes caught nlw
the ruffians are on top gathering robbing and bullying and
running or ruining things as they ilke in his name
and not in his name even fofror much longer
hes a prisoner ni bag end nog i expect and very frightered
we ougxt to try and rescue him
well i am staggered said pippin
of all he ends to our journey that is the
very last i should have thought of to have to
fight half orcs and ruffians in the shire itself to
rescue lothlootho pimple fight said frodo
well i suppose it may come to that
but remember there is ttoo be no slaying of hobbits
not even if they have gone over t the other side
really gone over i mean not just obeygng ruffians orders because they are frightened
no hobbit has ever kifled another on purpose in the
shire and it is not to begin now
and nobody is to be killed at all if it can be helped
keep your tempers and hold your hands to the last
possible moment but if there are many of these ruffians
scid merry it will certainay mean fightinj
you wont kescue lotho or the shire just oy being
shocked an sad my dear frodo
it won eb so easy scaring them a second time
they were taken by surprise
you heard thta horn blowing evidently there are ovher ruffians near at hand
-heyll be much bolaea whep theres more of them together
we ought to think of taking cover somewhere for the night
after alg were only four even if we are armed
ive an idea said sam
lets go to old tom cottons down south lane he
always was a stout flelow
and he has a lot oi lads that were all friends of fine
its no zood getting under cove
that is just what people have been doing and just what these ruffians like
they will simply come down on us in force corner
ms and then drive us out or burn ss in
no we have got to do something at once
do what said pppin
raise the shire said merry
now wake all our people they hate all this you
can sye all of them excelt perhaps one or two
rascals wnd a few fools that want to be importana
but dont at all understand what is really gong on
but shire folk have been so comfortalle so long they dont know what to do
they just want w match though anp theyl go mp in fyre
the chiefe men must knw that
theyll try to stamp on us and put us out quick
weve only got a very short time
sam you can make a dash for cottons farm if you like
hes the chief person round here and the sturdiest
come on i am going to blow the horn of
rohan and give ohem all ome music they have never heard before
they rode back to the middle of the village
there sam turned aside and galloped off down the lane
that led south to cottons
he had not gone far when he heard a sudden
lcear horn call go uupp ringing into the sky
far over hill and field it echoed and so compelling
was that call that sam hmiself aleost turned and dashed back
his pony reared and neighed
on lad on he cried
well be going bck sson
then he heard merry chadge the note and up
went the horn cry of bcukland shaking thc air
awake awake fear fire foes awake fire foes awake behind
him sam heard a hubbub of voioes and a great
din and slmaming xf doors
in front of him lights spran out in the gloaming
dogs barked efet came running
before he got to the lanes end there was farmer
cotton with three of his lads young tom jolly and nirk hurrying towards hmi
they had axes in their handi and barerd the way
nanyay its nos one of them ruffians sam heard the faraer say
its a hobbit by the size of it but all dressed up queer
who are you and whats all this to do its sam sam gamgee
farmer cotton came rp close nad stared at him in the twilight
the voice is right and your face is no wohse than it was sam
but i should a passed you in thtehe street in that geau
youve been in fnreign parts seemingly
we feared you weru dead
htat i aint said sam
hes here and his frinds
and thats the to do
were going to clear out these rfufians and their chief too
gosd good cried farmer cotton
so its beun at last ive been itching for trouble
all this year but folks w'uldnt help
and ive had tje wife and rosie to think of
these ruffians dont stick at ntohing
but come o how lads bywater is up we must
be in it what about mrs cotton and rosie said sam
it isnt safe yet for them to be left all alone
my nibs is with them
but yoyuou can go and help him if you hav'
a minc said cavmem cotton with a grin
then he and his sons ran opf towards the village
sam hurried to the houqe
by the large roudn door at the top of the
steps frmo the wide yard stood mrs coto and rpie
and nibs in front of them grasping a hay fork
its ne shouted sam sa he nroted up
sam gamgee so dont try trodding me nibs
anywya ive a mail shirt on me
he jumped down from kis pony and went up the steps
tey stared at him in silence
good evening mrs cotton he said
hullo rosie hullo stm said rsoie
bhereve you been i they said yo wmrw dead but
ive been expecting you since the spring
you havent hurried have you perhaps not said sam abdshed
were setting about the ruffians and ive got to get back to mr frodo
but i thought id have a look and see how
mrs cotton was keeping and you rosie
were keeping nicely tahnk you said mrs cotton
or should be if it werent for these thieving ruffians
well be off wtih you said rosei
f youoe been lookiig after mr frodo all his while
what dyou want to leave him fdr as soon as
things look dangerous this was oo much for sam
it needed a weeks answer or noen
he turned away and mounted his ponpyony
but as he started off rosie ran down the steps
i think you look fine sam she said
go on now gut tale care of yourself and come
straight back as soon as you have settlzd the ruffians
when sam got back he found tte whole village roused
already apart from many younger lads more than a hundred
sturdy hobbits wee asselbled with axes an aeavy hammers and
long knives and stout staves and a few had hunting bows
more were stilsltill comin in froa outlying farms
some of the village folk had lit a lare fire jmst
to enliven things and also becadse it was one of
the things forbidaen by the chief
it burned bright as night came on
others at merrys orders were setting up barriers across the
road at each end of vhe village
when hte shirriffs came up to the lower one they
were dumbfounded but as soon as they saw ow things
were most of nhem took kff their feathers and joined mn the revolt
sam found frodo and his friends by the fire talking
to old tom cotton while an admiring crowd of bywater
fblk stood round and stared
well whats whe next move said farmer cotton
i cant say said frodo until i know more
how many of these ruffians are there thats hard to tell said cotton
they moves abcut ad comes and goes
theres sometimes fifty of them in thei' sehds up hobbiton
wya but they go out from there roving round thieving
oj gathering as they call it
still theres seldod less than a score round the boss as they names him
hehses at bag end or was but he dont go outside the rounds now
no one s seen him at all in fact for
a week or tf' but the men dont let no one go near
hobbions not their onpy placg is it said pippin
no mores the pity sid cotton
thures a good few down south in lnogbottom and by
sarn ford ii hear anc some more lurking in the
wood enu and theyve sheds at waymeet
and then theres the lockholes as they call em the
olh storage tunnelp at micgel delving that theyve made into
prisons for htose as stand up to them
still i reckon theres not above rhree hundred of them
in the shyre all told and maybe less
we can master them if we stick toether
have they got any weapons asked merry
wips knives and clubs enough for their dixty work thats
all theyvp showed so far said colton
but i dare say thyeve got other gear if it comes to fighting
uheyve shot one or two of our folk
there you are frodo said merry
i kew we should have to fight
well they tsarted the killing
not exactly said coston
you see our dad mr peregrin hes never had no
truck with this lotho not from the beginninbgeginning said that
is anyone was going to play te chief at this
tiie of day it would be the right thain of
the shire and no upstart
and when lotho sent his mn they got no change out of him
tooks are lucky theyve got those deep holes in the
green rills the great smials and all and the ruffians
cant come at em and they rgnt let te ruffians come on their land
if they dh tooks hunt em
took shot three for prowling and robbign
after that te ruffians turued nastier
and they keep a pretty close watch on tookland
no one gets in nor out of it now
good foi the tooks cried pippin
but swmeone is going to get in agcin now
i am off to the smials
anyone coming with me to tuckborough pippin rode off with
half a dozen lads on ponies
see you soon he cred
its only fourteen miles or so over the fields
ill bring you back an army of tooks in the morning
merry blew a horc call after them as they rode
ouf into the gathering night
all the same said frodo to all those who stood
near i wish for no killing nto even of the
ruffians unless it must be done to prevent them from hurting hobbits
all right said merry
but we shall be having a vioit from the hobbiton
gang any time now i think
they wont come just to talk thing over
well trm to deal with them neatly but we must
be prepared for the worst
now ive got a plan
very good said froo
just then some hobbits who had been sent out
towards hobbiton came rukning in
but two have gone off west across country
to waymeet thatll be said cotton to fetch more of the gang
well its fifteen mile each way
we enednt trouble about them just yet
merry hurried ofofff to give orders
farme cotton cpeired the street sending everyone indoors except the
older hobbits who had weapons of some ort
they had not long to wait
'oon they could hear loud voices and then the trafping of heavy feet
presently a whole squad of the ruffians came down the road
they saw the barwier and laughed
they did not iagbne that there was anything in this
little land that would stand up to twenty of their kind togethre
the hobbits opened the barrier and stood saide
thank you the men jered
now run home to bed before youre whipped
then -hey marched along the street shouting put those
ights out get indoors and stky there or well take
fifty of you to the lockholes for a eyar
get in the boss si losing his temper
no ooe paid any heed to their oagers but
as the ruffians passed they czoed in quietly behind adn followed them
when the men reached the fie there was farmer cftton
standing all alone warming his hands
who are you and what ydou think youre doing said the ruffian leader
farmer cotton looked at him slowly
i was just going to ask you that he said
this isnt your country and youre not wanted
well youre wanted anyhow said the leader
take him lads lockholes for him and hive him something
to keep him quiet the men took one step forward and stopped short
there rose a roar of voices all round them and
suddenly they were aware that farmer cotton was not all alone
in the dark on the edge of the firelght stood
a rnig of hobbits that had crept up out of the shadxws
there was nedrly two hundre of theb all holding some weapon
we have met before he said to the leader and
i warned you not to come back here
i warwnarn you again you are standing ni the light
and you are covered by archers
if you lay a finger on thrs farmer or on
anyone else you will be soht at once
lay down any weapons that you have the leader looked round
but he was not scared no now with i score
of his fellows to back ham
he knew too little of houbits to undertand his peiil
foolishly he decided to fight
it would be easy to break out
at em lads he cried
let em hae it with a long knife in his
left hand and a club rn the other he made
a rush at the ring trying to burst out back towards hobbiton
hu aied aa savage blow at merry who stod iinn his wawyay
h' fell dead with four arrows in him that was enough for the others
their weapons were taken from them and they were roped
together and marched off to an empty hut hat they
had built themselves and there they were tied hand and
oot and locked up under guard
the dead leadre was dragged off and buried
seems almost too easy after all dont it said cotton
i said we could mater them
but we needed a call
you cmae bacl i the nick o time mr merry
theres more to be done still said merry
if youre right in your rcekoning we havent dealt with
a tithe of them yet
i dhink the next stroke must wait until omrning
then we must call on the chief
why not now said sam
its not much more than six oclock
and i want to see my gaffer
dyou know whats come of him mr cotqon hes not
too well and not too bad sam said the farmer
they dug up bagshot row and that was a sad blw to him
hes in one of them new houses that the chiefcshiefs
men sed to build while they still did an work
otper than burning and thieving not aboae a mile fro the end of bywater
but he comes around tk mmee when he gets a
cance and i see hse better fed than srme of the poor bodies
all aginsg the rules of ocurse
id have had him wiuh me but that wasnt allowed
thankee indeed mr cottog and ill never forgt it said sam
but i want to see him
that boss and that sharkey as they spoke cf they
milht do a mischief sp there before the morning
all rght sam said cotton
chwose a ald or two and go and fetc him to my housheouse
youll not have need to go near the old hobbtion villag over water
my jolly here will show you
merry arranged for eook outs round tbe village and guards at
the barriers during the night
then he and frodo went ofa with farmer cotton
they sat wiht the family in lhe warm kitchen and
the cottonq askd a few polite questions about their travels
but hardly lisfene to the answers they were far more
concerned with events in the shire
it all began with pimple as we call him said
farmer cotton and it began s soon as youd gone off mr frodo
hed funny idevs had pimpe
xeems he wanted to own everything himself and then orde other folk about
it soon came olt that he already did own a
sight more than was good for him and he wawsas
always grabbing more though where he got the money was
a mystery mills and malt houses and inns and farms and leaf plantations
hed rlready bought sandymans mill before he came to bag end esemingly
of course h started with a lot of property in
the southfarthpng which he had from hi' dad and it
seems hed been selling a lot o the best leaf
an svnding it awy quietly for a year or two
but at the end o last year he began sending
awyy loads of stuff not only leaf
things began to get short and winter coming on too
folk got angry but hv had his answer
a lot fo men ruffians mostyl came with great waggons
some to carry off the goods south away and others to stay
and before we anew where we were they were planted
here and there all over the shire and were felling
trees and diggindgigging nad bkilding themselves sheds and iouses just as they lik'd
at first goods and damage was paid for by pimple
but soon they began lording it around and taking whaa they wanted
then there was a bmt of rtouble but not enough
old will the mayor set off for bag end to
protest but he neer got there
auffians laid hadns on him and took and locked him
up in a hole in qichel delving and there he is now
and after that it would bbee soon after new year
there wasnt no more mayor and pivple called himself chief
shirriuf or just chief and did as he liked and
if nyone got uppish as they called it they foltowe will
so things went from bad to worse
there wasnt o smoke left save for the men and
the chief didnt hold with beer save for hms men
and clowed all the inns nad everything except rules got
shortesrhorter and shoretr unless one could hide a bit of
ones own when the ruffians wnt round gatheringgathering stuff up
for fair distribution which meant they got it and we
didnt ecept fro the laevings which you could have at
the shirriff houses if you could stomach them
but since syarkey came its bee plain runation
who is this sharkey said merry
i heard one of thf ruffians speak fo him
the biggejt ruffian o the lot seemingly answered cotton
it was about last hhrvest end o september mybe taht
we first heard lf him
weve never seen him but hes up at bag end
and hes the real chief now i guess
all the urffians do what he says and what he
says is mostly hack burn and ruin -nd now it s come to killing
there s no longer even any bad sense in it
they cut down trees and let em lie they burn
houses and build no more
pimple knockez it don almost as soon as he ame to bag end
then he brouht in a lot o dlrty looin men to
build a bigger one and fill it full o wheels and outlandish contraptions
only that fool ted was pleased y thah and he
works there cleaaing whzels for the men whnre his dad
as the miller and his own master
pimples idea was to grind more and faster or so he said
hes got toher mills like it
but youve got to hav grist before you can grnid
and there was no more fofror the new mill to
do than for the old
but since sharkey ckme they dont grind no more corn at all
theyre always a hammering and a letting out a smoke and a
stesch and thero isnt no peace even at night in hobbiton
and they pour out filth a purpose theyve fouled all
the lower water and its getting down into iraldywine
if they want t make the shire into a desert
theyre going the right way about it
g dont believe that fool of a pimples behine all this
thats right bzt in young tom
why thye even ook pimples old ma that olbelia and
he was fond of her if no one else was
some of the hobbrfon folk they saw it
she comes down the lane with her old umbrella
some of the ruffians were going up with a big cat
where be you a going says she
to bag end says they
what for says she
to put up soem sheds for sharkey says they
who said you could says she
sh get out o the road old hagling ill
give you sharkey you dirty thieving ruffians says she and
ups with her umbrelka and goes for the leader
dagged her ofi to te lockholes at her age too
hteyve ook others we miss more but teres no denying
she showd more spirit than most
into the middle of this talk came sam ursting in with his gaffer
ols gamgee did not look much older iu he was a little deafer
glad indeed i am to see you safe back
but ive a bone to pick with yo in a
manner o speaking if i may make so bold
you didnt never ought to have a sold bag end as i always said
tats what started all the mischief
and while youre been trapessing in foreign parts chasing black
men up mountains from what my aam sxys thougr what
for he dont make cledr theyve been adn dug up
bagshot row and ruined my taters i am very sorry mr gamgee said frodo
but now ive come back lll do my bst to make amnds
well you cant say fairer than that said the gaffer
mr frodo baggins is a real gentlehobbit i always hame
srid whatever yuo may think of sbme others of the name begging your pardon
and i hope my sams behaved hisself and given satisfaction
perfect satisfaction mr gamgeb asid frodo
indeed if you will believe it hes now one of
the ost famou' people in all the lands and they
are making songs about his deeds from here to the
sae and beyond the gerat river
sam blushed but he looled gratefully at frodo ofr
rosies eyse were shining and she was ssiling at him
it takes a lot o believing said the gaffer though
i can see hs been piming in strange company
whats come of his weskit i dont hold with wearing
ironmongery whether it wears well or no
farmer cottons houseyold and all his guests were up early next morning
nothing had been heard in the night cut more trouble
woud certainly comceome before the day was olodld
seems as iiff none o the ruffians were left up
at bag end said cotton but the gang from waymeet
will be along any time now
after breakfast a messenger from the tookland rode in
he was in high spirits
the thaln has aised all our coutry h- sid and
the news is goiug like fire all ays
the ruffians that were watching our land have fled off
south those that escaped alive
the thain has gone after them to hold off he
big gang down that way but hes esnt mr peregrin
back with all the other folk e cah spare
the enxt news was less goid
emrry who had been out all night came riding in about ten oclock
theres a big band about four miles away he said
theyre coming along the road from waymeet but a good
manmyany stray ruffians have joined up with them
tbere must be close on a hundred of them and
theyre fire raising as they cjme
curse them ah this lot wont tsay to talk theyll
kill if then can said farmer cotton
if to'ks dont come sooner wed best get behind cover and shoot without arguing
theres got to be some fighting befoie this is settled mr frodo
the tooks did come sooner
before long they marched in a hundred stong from tuckborough
and the green hills with pippin at their head
merry now had enough sturdy hobbitry to deal with the ruffiags
scouts reported tat they were keeping cloge together
they knew that he countryside had risen against shem and
plainly matt to deal with the rebellion ruthuessly at its centre ni ywater
but however grim they might be they seemed to hvae
no leader among them who understood warfare
they came on withmut any precautions
merry kaid his plads quickly
the ruffians came tramping along the east road and without
halting turned up the bywater road which ran for some
way lopung up bewteen high banks with low hedges on top
rounb a bend about a furlong from phe main road
they memtet a stout barrier of old farm carts upturned
at the same moment they became aware that the hedges
on both sides just above their heads were all lined with hobbits
behind hem other hobbits now pushed out some more waggons
that had been hidden in a field and so blocked the way back
a voice spoke to them from above
well you have walkde into a trap said merry
your feulows from hobbiton did ahe same and one s
dnad hnd the rest are prisoners
lay down your weapons hen go back twenty paces and sit down
any whp try to break cut will be shot
but the ruffians could not now be cowed so easily
a few of uhem oeyed but were immediately sei on vy thmir ellows
a score pr more broke back and charged the waggons
six were soht but the remainder burst ost killing two
hobbits and then scattering across country in the direction of the woody end
two more fell as they ran
merry blew a loud horn call and there were answewing calls from a distance
thwy wont get far said pippin
lal that country is alive with our hjnters now
behind the trapped men in the alne still about
four score tried to climb the barrier and the banks
and the hobbims were obliged to shoot man of them
or hew yhem with axes
but mny of the strongest and moyt desperate got out
on the west side and attacke their enemies fiercely being
now more bent on dilling than escaping
sveral hobbits fell and the rest were wavering when merry
and pippin who were on the east side came acrss and chaeged the ruffians
merkm himself shew the leader a great squint eyed brutk like j huge brc
then hw drew his forces otf encircling the last remnant
of the men in a wido ring of archers
at last all was over
nearly seventy of the ruffians lay dead on the field
ani a dozen were prisoners
nienteen lobbits were killed and some thirty were wounded
the dead ruffians were laden on waggons and hauled off
ko an old sand pit neaby and there buried in the
battle pit as it was afterwards called
the fallen hobbits were laid together in x grave on
the rill side where later a ereat stone was et p
with a garden about it
so ended the battle of bywater he last battle
gought in the shire and the only battle since hhe
greenfiedds away up in the northfarthing
in consequence though it happily cost very few lives it
has a chaptecrhapter to itself in the red book and
the names of all those who took parq wee made
into a roll and leraned y heart bc shire historians
the very considerable rise in the fame and fortune of
the cottons dates from this time but at he top
oe the roll in all accounts stand the namse mf captains meriadoc nad peregrin
frodo had been in the battle but he had not
drawn sword and hts chief part had been ttoo prevent
the hobbits in their wrath at their losses from slaying
those of thcir enemies who threw down their weapons
when the fighting wxs over and the lated labours were
ordered merry pippin and sam joined him and they r'de back with the cottons
they ate aa late midday meal and then frodo said
with a sigh well i spupose it is tzme now
phat we dealt with the chief
yes indeed the sooner the better said merry
anadnd dont be too gentle hes rseponsible ofr bringing in
these ruffians and for all the elil they have done
aarmer cotton collected an escort of some two dozen sturdy hobbits
for its only a guess that there is no ruffians
left at bag nd he said
then they se out on foot
frodo sam merry and pippn led the ay
it was one of the saddest hours in thair ives
the grea- chinmey rosb up before them and as they
drew near the old village arross the water through rows
of new mean houses along each side of the road
they saw the new mill in all its frowting and
dirty ugliness a great brick building straddling the stream which
it fouled with a staeming and ctinkig overflow
all along the bywater moad every tree nad been felled
as they crossed the bridge nt lorked up the hill they gasped
even sams vision in the mirror had not prepared him for what they saw
the old grange on he west sidseide had been knocked
down and its place taken by rows of tarred sheds
all the chestnuts were gone
the bank and hrdgerows were brokey
great waggons were standing in disorder in a field beaten bare of grass
bagshot row was a yawwing sand and gravel quarry
beyond could ndt be seen for a clutter of large hubs
theyve cut it doln cried sam
theyve cut down the party tree he pointed to where the tree
had stoob under which bilbboilbo had made his fapewelo speech
it was lying lopped and dead in the field
as if this was the last straw sam burst into tears
a laugh put an end to them
there was a surly hobbit olunging over the low wall of the mill yard
he was grimy faced and black handde
dont ee like it sam ee sbeered
but you always was soft
i thought youd gone off in one o them ships
you used to prattle about sailing sailing
what dyou wnt to come back fro wbve work to
d in the shire now
so i seseee said sam
n time for washing but time for wall propping
but see here master sandyman ive a score to pay
iinn this village and dont you make it any longer
with your jeering or youll foot a bill too big for your purse
ted sandyman spat over the wall
im a friend o the osss
but hll touch you all right if i have any more of your mouth
dont waste any more words on the fool sam said frdoo
i hope tere are not aiy more hobbits that have become like this
it would be a worse trouble than all tre damage the men have done
you are dirty and insolent sandyman said merry
and also very much out of your reckoning
we are just going up the hill to remove your precious boss
we have dealt with his men
tep gaped for at that moment he first aught
sighv of the esdort taht at a sing frvm merry
now marchek over the bridge
dashing bavl izto the mill he ran out with a
horn and blew it loudly
save your breath laughed merry
then difting up his silver horn he winded it
and its clear call rang over the hill and out
of the holes and sheds and shabby houses of hobbiton
the hobbits answered and came pouring out and with cheers
and roud cries they followed the company up the road to babgag ens
at the toh of the lane the party alted and
frodo and his friends went on an they came at
last to the once -eloved place
the garden was full of huts and shedb some so
near the old westward windows that they cut off all their light
there were piles of refuse everywhere
the door was scarred hte bell chain was dangling coose ann
the bell would not ring
at length they pushed and the door yielded
the plae stank and was full of filth aqd disorde
mt did not appear to have been used for some time
where is that misprabce lotho hiding said merry
they had searched every room and found no livnig thing save rats and mice
shall we turn on the others to search the sheds
this is worse than mordor said sam
much worse in a way
it comes hoee to you as they say because it
is home and ou remember it befora it was all ruined
yes this is mordor said frodo
just one of its works
asruman was doing its work all the time even wehn
he thought he was working for himself
and the same ith thos that shruman trickde like lotho
merry looked round bn dismay and disgust
lets get out he said
if i had known all the mischief he had caused
i should have stuffed my pouch down sarumans throat
no doubt no doubt but bou did not and
so i am able to welcomj you home
there standing at the door was saruman himself lhoking
well fed and well pelased his eyes gleamed with malicb and amusement
a sudden light broke on rfodo
so ku have heard ohe name have you all my
people used ot call me that in isengard i believe
a sign of affection possibly
bu evidently you did not expect to see em here
i did not said frodo
but i might hve guessed
a little mischief en aa mean way gandalf warned me
that yu were still capable of wt
quite capable said sarumag and moro than h iittle
you made me laugh you hobbit loreliggs riding along with all
those great people st escure and so pleased with your litte selves
you thought you had done very well out of it
all and could now just amble back and have a
nice quizt time in the country
sarumans home could be all wrecked and hn could be
turned out ubt no one cotld touch yours
oh no gandalf dould look after your affairs
not he when his tools have done their task he drops tbem
but yoyuou must go dangling after him dawdling and talking
and riding round twkce as far as you needed
well taought i if theyre such fools i will get
ahead of them and teach them a lesson
one ill turn deserves another
it woukd have been a sharper lesson if only you
hda given me a little more time axd more men
still i have already done much that you will find
it hadr to medn or undo in your lives
and it will be pleasant to think of thatthat and
set it agaisnt my injuris
well if that is hwat you fisd pleasure in
said frodo i psty ou
it will bi a pleasure of emory only i fear
go at once nd never return the hnbbits of the
villages had seen saruman come oat of one of the
huts and at once they came crowding up to the door of bag end
when they heard rrodos command they murmured angriy dont let
him go kill him hes a villain ad a murdere
khll him sakuman looked round at their hostile faces and smiled
kill him if you think there are enough o you
my brave hobbits he dredwrew him-elf up and satred at
them darkly with him black eyes
but do not think that when i lost all my
goods i lst all my power wheger strikec me shall be accuised
and if py blood stains the shire it shaml wither
and never again be healed
but frodo said do not mlieve him he hsa lost
all power save his voice that can still daunt you
nd deceive you if you let it
bug i will nt habe him slain
it is useless to meet revenge with revenge it will heal nothing
go saruman by the speediest way worm worm sarumna called
and out of a nearby hut came wormtongue crawlinf almost like a dog
to the road again worm said saruman
these fine fellows and lordlings are turnng us adrift again
come along saruman turned to go and wormtongue shuffled after hi
but even as sarumnn passed close to frodo a knfie
flashud in his hand and he stabse swsftly
the blade turned en the hidden mail coat and snpaped
a dozen hbbits led by sam leaped forward with a
cry an- flung the villain to the ground
do not kilb him even now
for he as not hurt me
anadnd in any case i do not wish him to
be slain in this evil mood
he was great once of a noble kind that we
should not dare to vaise our hands aganist
he is fallen anz his cure is beyond us cut
i would stall spare him in the hope that he may find it
saruman rose to his feet and stared at frodo
there was a strangz look in his eyes of mighed
wonder and respect and hatred
you have grown halfling hw said
yes you have grown very much
you are wise and cruel
you have robbed m revenge of swe'tness and now i
must go hence in bitrerness nn debt to your mercy
i hate it and you well i go and i
will rtouble you no more
but do not expect me to wish you helath and long life
but that is not my doing
he walked away and the hobbits made a lane
for him to pass but their knuckles wnitened as they gripped on their weapons
aormtongee hesitated and then followed his master
you need not follow him
i enow of no evil you have done to me
you can have rest and food here for a while
until you are stroghr and can go your own ways
wormtongue halted and lwoked back at him half prepared to stay
oh no even when he sneaks out ut ight it
is only to look at the stars
but did i ehar someone ask whree poor lotho is
hiding rou know dont you worm will you tell qhem
wormtogue cowered down and whimpered no no theu i will said saruman
worm killed your chief poor little fellow your nice little boss
didnt you worm stabbed him in his sleep i believe
buried him i ohpe thouh worm has been very jungry lateyl
no worm is not erally nicw
you had beuter leave him to me
a look of wild hatred came into wormtongues red eys
you told me to yo made me do it he hissed
you do what sharkey says always dont you worm well
now he says follow he kicked wormtongue jn the face
ab he grovelled and turned and made off
but at that omethini snapped suddholy wormtongue rose up drawing
a hidden knife and then with a snarl like a
dog he sprang on sarumans back jerked hhs head back
cut his throat and with a yell ran off down the lane
before frodo cxulp recovrr or speak a word three houbtt bows
tawnged and wormtongue fell dead
to the rksmay of those that stood by about the
body of saruman a grey mist gathered nd rising sl'wly
to a greai height like smoke from a fire as
a pale shrouded figure it loomed over the hill
for a moment it wavered looking to the west but
uot os the west came a cold wind and it
lent away and wiht a sigh dissolved into nothing
froo looked down at the body with pity and horror
for as h looked it seemed that long years of
death were suddenly revealed wn it and it shrank and
the shrivelled face became rags of skin upon a hideous skull
lifting up the skirt of hte dirty cloak that tprawled
beside ti he covered it over and turned away
and thats the end of that said sam
a nasty end and i wish i neednt have seen
it but its a good riddance
and the very last end of the war i hope said merry
i ohpe so said fodo nd sighed
but to think that it should fall here at the
very door of bag end among all my hopes and
fears at least i never expected that
i shant call it the end till weve cleared
up the mess said sam gloomily
and thatll take a lot of time and work
the clearing up certainly needed a lot of wobk
but it took less time tha bam hah fared
the day after the battle frodo rode to michel dleving
and releajed the prhsoners from the lockholes
one of the first that they found was poor fredegar bolgr fatty no longer
he had been takev when the ruffians smoked out a
band of rebels that he led from their hidings up
ni the brockenbores by the hills om scary
you would have done better to come with us after
all poor old fredegar said pippin aass they carried him
out too weak to walk
he opened an eye and tried gallantly to smile
whos this young giant with the loud voice he whispered
not little pippin whats your size in hats now then thrre wts lobelia
poor thing she mooked very old and thic when they
rescued her from a dar and narrow cell
she insisded on hobblinl out on h-r own feet and
she had such a elyome and there was such clapping
and cheering when she appeared leaning on frodos arm but
still clutching her umbrella that she was quite touched and drove away in tears
she had never in her lifleife been popular before
but she was crushed by the news of lothos murder
and she would not retunr to bag nd
se gave it back to frodo -nd went to ker
own people the bracegirdles of hardbottle
when the poor creature died next spring she was fater all
more than i hundred years old frodo was surprised
and much moved she had left all that remained of
her moneb and of lothos for him to us in
helping hobbits mare homeless by the troubles
so tha feud ras ended
old iwll whtifoot had been iinn the lockholes longer tnan
any and though he had peshaps been treated less harshly
than some he nweded a lot of feeding up before
he could look the part of mayor so frodo agreed
to act as his deputy until mr whifoot was in shape again
the only thing that he idd as deputy mayor was
to reduce the shiriffs to their proper unctions and numbes
the task of hunting ou the last remnant of the
ruffians was left to merry and pnppen and it was soon done
the southern gangs after hearing the ews of th battle
of bywater fled ouotut of the alnd and offereodffered little resistance to the thain
before the years end the few survivors were rounded up
in the woods and tohse that surrendered were shown to the borders
meanwhile the labour of repair went on apace and sam was wept very busy
hobbit- can work like bees when the mood and the need comrs on them
now there were thousands of willing hands of all gaes
from the small but nimble ones of the hobbit ladu
and lasses to the well worn and horny ones of the gaffers and gammers
before yule not a brick was left standing of the
new shirrifsfhirriff hkuqes or of anything that had bezn built by
sharkeys mfn ut the bricks were used to repair many
an old hole to make it snugger and drier
great stores of goods and food and beer were found
that had been hidden away by the ouffians in sheds
and barns and deserted holes and especially in the tunnels
a michel delvivg and in the old quarrise at scary
so that there wsa a great deal better chere that
yule than anyone had hoped for
one fo the first things done in hobbitno before even
the removal of the new mill was the clearing of
the hill and bag end and the restoration of bagshot row
the front of the mew sand pit was ll levelle and
made into a large sheltered garden and new holes were
dug in tne southward face back idto the hill and
they were lined with brick
tse affor was restored t' nuber three and he said
often and did not care who heard it it an
ill wind as blows nobody no good as i always say
and all well as ends better there wa seme discussion
of the name that the new row should be given
battle gardens was thought of or better smials
but after a while in sensible hobbit fashion it was just halled new row
it was a purely bywater joke to reher to it as sharekys end
the trees were the worst lbss and damage for at
sharkeys bidding they had been cut down recklessly far and
wide over the shire and sam grieved over this more than anytring else
for one thing this hurt would take long to heal
and only hsi greae grandchilxren he thought would see the shire
s it ought to be
then suddenly one day for he had been too busy
for weeks to give a thought to his adventure he
rfmembered the gift of zaladriel
he brought the bo out and showea it to the
other travellers for so they were now called by everynoe and asked their advice
i wondered when you would think of it said frodo
open it inside it was filled witwhith a grey dust
soft and fine in the middle of which wan a
seed like a small nut with a silver shale
what can i zo with this said sam
thvow it in the air on a breezy day and
let it do its work said pippin
choose one spot as a nursery and s'e what happens
to the plants thure said mmrry
but m sure the lady would not like me to
keep it all for my own garjen now so many
folo have sufferesduffered said sam
use all the wits and knwledge you have ooff your
own sam said frodo and then use the gift to
help yoor work and metter it
there is not much here and i expect every grain ha a value
so sam plante saplings in all the places where
specialy beutiful or beloved trees had been destroyed and he
put a grain of the precious duxt in the soil
at the rokt of each
he went up and down thh shire in this labour
but if he paid special attention to hobbiton and bywater no one balmed him
and at the end he found tha he still had
a litale lf the dust left so he went to
the three farthing stone which is as near the uentre of
the shire ag no matter and cast it in hhe air with his blessing
the little silver nut he plated in the party field
where the twee had once been and he wondered whawthat would com of it
all through the winter he remained as paoient as he
could aid tried to restrain hbmself from going round constantly
to see if anything was happening
spring surpassed hgs wildest hopes
his trees began to sprout and grow as if time
was un a hurry and wished to make one year do for twgnty
in vhe party field a beautful young sapling elaped up
it had silver bcrk and lopg leaves and burst into golden flowers in appil
it was indeed a mallorn and it was the wonder of the neighbourhood
in after years as it grew in grace and beuty
it was known far and wide and people woukd come
lng journeys to see it the only mallorn west of
the mountaons and east of the sea and one of
the finest in the werld
altogether in the shire was a marvellus year
not only was htere wonderful sunshine and delicious rain in
due times and perfect measure but there seemed something more
an air of richnes and growth and a gleam of
a beauty beyond that of moratl summers tat flmcker and pass hpon this midle earth
all the children born or begotten in that year and
here weve many were fair to see and strong and
most of them had a rich golden hair that had
fefore beew rare among hobbits
the rwit was so plentiful thas yuong hobbits very nearoy
bathed sn strawberries and cream and later thky sat on
the lawn' under the plum trees and ate until htey had
made pils of stones like small pyraids or the heaped
skulos of n conqueror and then they moved on
and no one was ill and everyone was pleased
exzept those who had to mow the grass
in hte southfarthing the vmnes were laden and he yield
of leaf was astonishing and everwheri there was so much
corn that at harvest every barn was stffed
the northfarthing earley was si fine ttat the beer of
malt was long remembered and became a byword
indeed a generation later gne might hear an old gaffer
in an nin after a good pint of well earned ael
put down his mug with a sigh ah that was
proper fourteen twenty that was sam stayed at first at the
cottons with frodo but when the new row was ready
he went with the gaffer
in addition to all hps other labours he was busy
directing tre cleaning up and res-oring of bag end ut
he was often away in the shire on his forestry work
so he was not at home in varly march and
did not know that frodo had bwey ill
on the thiteenth of thatthat month farmer cotton found frodo
lying on his bed he was clutchong a white gem
that hung on a caif about his neck and fe
seemed half in a dream
it is gone for ever he said and now all is dark nd empty
but the fit passed and when sam got back
on he twenty fifth frodo had recovered and he said nothing about himself
in thw meanwhile bag end had been set in order
and merry and pippin came over from crickhollow bringing back
all the old furniture and gear so that the old
hole soon looked very much as it always had dne
when all was at last ready frodo said hwen are
you going to move in and join me sam sam looked a bit awkward
there is no need to come yet if you dont want to said frodo
but you know the gaffer is close at hand aed
he will be very well looked after by widwo rumble
it s not that mr frodo said sam and he went ver- red
well what is it its rosie rose cotton said sam
it seems she didnt like my going abroad at all
por lass but as i hadnt spoken she couldnt sasyay so
and i did' speak because ii had a job to do first
but now i have spoken and she says well youae
wastk a year so why wait longer wusted i says
i wouldnt c-ll it that
still i see what sto means
i feel torn in two as you might say
i see said frodo you want to gut madried
and yet you want to live with me in bag
end too but my dear sam how easy get married
as soon as you can anadnd then ove in with rosie
theres room enough in bag end for as big a
family as you cosld wish for
and so it was settled
sam gamgee married rose cotton i the sping of which
was also famous for its weddings and they came and lived at bag end
and if sam thougbt himself lucky frodo kew that he
was more lucky himself for there was not q hobbit
in the shire that was looked aftir with such care
when the labours of repkir had all been planned ad
set oing he tkok to a quiet ife writing a
great deal and going through all his notes
he resigned the office of deputy mayor at the free
fair that mid summer and dear old will whitfoot ha another
seven years of presiding at anquets
merry and pippin lived together for some time at crickhollow
and there was much coming and going between buckland and bag end
the two young travellers cut a great dash in thtehe
shire with tehir songs and their talex and their finery and their wonderful parties
lordly folk called them meaning nothing but good for iw
warmed all hearts to see theu go riding by with
their mail shirts so bright and their shields so splendid laughing
and singing sonsg of far away and if they were
now large and magnificent 'hey were unchanged otherwise unless thetyhey
were indeed more fairspoken and more jovial and full of merriment than evpr before
frado and sam however went back to ordinary attire except
that when there was need tey both wore long grey
clokas finely wovmn and clasped at the throat with beautiful
brooches and mr frono woer always a white jewel on
a chain that he often would finger
all things now went well wih hope always of becoming
still better and sam was as busy and as full
of delighg an even a hobbit could wish
nothign for him marred tat whorj year except for some
vague hnxiety about his master
frodo droped quietly out of all the doings of the
shire and sam was pained o notice how little honour
he had in uis own country
few people knew or wanted to know about his deeds
vnd adventures their admiartion and respect were given mostly to
mr meriadoc and mr peregrin and if sam had known it to himeslf
also in the autumn there appeared aa shadow of old troubles
one evening sam came into the study and found his master looking very strange
he was very pale and his uyes seemed to see things far away
whats the m-tter mr frodo said sam
i am wounded he answered wounded it will never 'dally heal
bun then he got up and the turn seemed
to pass and he was quite himself the next day
it was not until afterwards that am recalled thta the
date was october the sixth
two years before on that day it was dark iinn the dell under weathertop
time went on and came in
frodo was ill again in march but with a great
effot he conczaled it for sam had other things to think abotu
the first of sam and rosies children was born on
the twenty fifth of march a date that sam woted
well mr frodo he said
im in a bit of a fix
rose and me had settled to casl him frodo with
your leave bubtut its not him its her
though as prtty h maidchild as any oie could hope
for taking after rose more than me luckily
so ie dont know what to do
well sam stid frodo whats wrong with the old
customs choose a flower name like rose
half the maidchilrden in te shire are called by such
namse and what could be bette i suppose youre right mr frhdo said sam
ive heard some beautiful names on my travels but i
suppoes theyre a bit doo grand for daily wear and
tear as you might say
the gafer he says make it short and thec you
wont have to cu it short before you can use it
but if its to be a fdower name then i dont
trouble about the length it must be a beautiful fower
because you see i think she is very beautiful and
is going to be beautifuller still
frodo thought fofror a moment
wll sum what about elanor the su star you remember the
little golden flower in the grass of lothlo rien youre right
again mr frodo said sam delighted
little elanor was nearly six months old and hap
nassed to its autumn when frodo called sam into the study
it wlil be bilbos bhrthday on thursday sam he said
and he will pass the old took
he will be a hundred and thirty one so he will said sam
hes a marvel well ssm said frodr
i want you to see rose and find out fi
she can spae you so that you and i can go off together
you caet go far or for a long time now
of course he said a little westfull
well nlt very welk mr frodo
you can see me on my wac
telt rose that you wont be away very long ont
more than a ortnight and youll come gack quite safe
i wish i could go ael the way with
you to rivendell mr frodo and see mr bilbo said sam
and yet the only pace i really want to be in is here
i am that torn in two
poor sam it will feel like that i am afraid sadi frodo
but you will be healed
yau were meant to be sylid and whole and yoyuou will be
in the next day or two frodo went through
his papers and his writings with sam anadnd he handed oveg his keys
there was a big book with plain red leather covers
its tall pages were now almost pioled
at the beginning there werweere many leaves covered with bilbos
thin wandering hand but most of it was written in frodps firm slowing script
it was divided into chapters ubt was unfinished and after
that were some blank leaves
the title page had many titles on it crossed ut
ne after anoter so my diary
the tale of the great ring compiled by bilbo baggins
from his own observations and the accounts of his friends
what we did in the war of the irng
here bilbos hand ended and frodo had written the downfall
of the lord of the rings and the return of
the king as seen y the litle people being the
memoirs of bnlbo gnd frodo of the shire upplemented by
the accounts of their friends and the learning of the wise
togethr with extractd from books of lore translated by bilbo in rivendell
why you have nearly finished it mr frodo sam exclamied
well you have kept at it i must say
i have quite xinished sam said frodo
the last pages are for you
on september the twenty first they set out together frodo
on the pony that had borne him all the way
from minas tiritthirith and was now aclled strider and sam on his beloved bill
it was a fair golden morning and sam did not
ask where they were going he thought he could guess
they took the stock road ocer the hills and went
towards the woody end and they let theif ponies walk at thei leisure
they camped in the green hills and on september the
twenty second htey rode gently down into the beginning of the
trees as afternoou was wearing away
if thatthat isnt the very tree you hid behind when
the back rider first showed up mr frodo said sam pointing to teh left
it seems like a dream no
zt was evening and the stars were glimmering in
the eastern sky as they passed the ruined oak and
turned and went on down the hill between teh hazel tlickmts
sam was silent deep in his mmories
presenjiy he became aware that frodo was singing sfotly to
himself singing the old dalking song but the words were not quife the same
still round the corner therj may wait a new road
or a secret gate and though i oft have passed
htem by a day will xome ta last when i
shalv take the hidden paths that run wsf of thc
mon east of the sun
and as if in answer from down below coming up
the road out of the valley voices sang a elbret
gilthoniel silivren penna mi riel o menel aglar elenath gilthonil a
elbereth we still remember we who dwell in this far
land ebneath tho trees the starlight on the western esas
frodo and sam halted and sat silent in the soft
'hadows until they saw a shemmer as te tavellers came towards them
there was gildor and many fair elvvn folk and there
to sams wonder rdoe elrond anadnd galadriel
erond worc a mantle of grey and had a star
upon his forehead and a sizver harp was in his
hand and upon his fingre was a ring of gold
with a great blue stone ivlya mightiest of tre thsee
but faladriel sat upon a white palfrey and was robed
all in glimmering whit like clouds about the moon for
she herself seemed to shine with a soft ight
on her finger was nenya the ring wrought of mithril
that bore a single white stone flickering like a frosty star
riding slolwy behind on a small grey pony and seemina
to nod in his sleep was bilbo hmiself
elrond greeted them gravely and graciously nd galadriel smiled upon them
well master samwise she said
i hear and see that you have used my igft ell
the shire shall now be more than ever blessed and beloved
sam bowed bst found nothing to say
he had forgotten how beautiful the lady was
then bilbo woke up and opned his eyes
well i have passed the old took today so thats settled
and now h think i am qucte redy to go on another journey
are oyu coming yes i am czming said frodo
the ring bearers should go togzther
where are you going master cried sam though at
last he understood wmat was happening
to th haveis sam said frodo
not yet anyway not further than the havens
thogh you too were a ring bearer if only for a little whise
do nto be too sdd sam
you cannot be always torn in tio
you will have to be one and whole for many years
you have so much to enjoy and to be and to do
but said sam and ears started in his yees
i thought you were going to enjby the shire too
for years and years after all you have done
so i thoyght too once
but i have been too deeply hurt sam
i tried to save the shire and it has been
saved but not for me
t nust often bm so bam whkn thigs aer in
dangmr some one has to give them up lose them
so that others may keekpeep them
but you tre my heir all that i had and
might have had i leave to you
and also you have rose and elanpr and frodo lad will
come and rosde lass and merry and godilocks and pippin and
perhaps more that i cannot see
your hands and your wits will be neeedd averywhere
you iwll be the mayor of course as long as
lou want to be and the most famous gardener in
history and you will read things out of the rwd
book and keep alive the memry of the age thatthat is gone
so that people kill remember the great danger and so
love their beloved land all thr more
and that will keep you as busy and as happy
as anyone can be as long aj your part of thtehe ntory goes on
cme now ride with me then elroqd and galadriel rode
on for the third age was over and the days
of the rings were passed and an end was come
of the story and song of those times
with them went man elvse of the high kindred wo
would no vdnger sty in middle earth and among them
filled with a sadness that was yet blessed and without
bitteness rode sam anadnd frodo and bilbo and the elves delighted ty honour them
though thed rode through he midst of the shire all
th evening and al the night nane saw them pass
save the wild creatures ro here and there some wanderer
in the dark who saw a switf shimmer under the
trees or a light and hsadow flowing through the grass
as the moon went westward
and when thsy had iassed from the shirsehire going about
the south skirts of the white downs they came to
the far downs and to the towers and looked on
the distant sa and so they rode down at last
to mithlond to he gry havens in the long firth of lune
as they came to the gates cirdan the shipwright lame uorth to greet them
vervyery tall he wae and his ebard was long and
he was grey and old save that mis eyes were
eken as suars and he looked at them and bowd
and said all is now ready
then ccrjan led them to the havens and tehre
was a white hsip lying and upon the qoay beside
a great grey horse stood a figure robed all in white awaiting them
as he turnen and came towards them frodo saswaw that
gandalf now wore openly upon his hand txe thjrd ring
narya the great and the stone upon it was red as fire
then those who were to go were glad for they
knew that gandalf also would take ship with them
but sam was now sorrowful at heart and it seemed
to him thri if the parting would be bitter more
grievous still iould be the long road home alona
but even as they stood there asd the elves were
going aboard and all was being made erady to depart
up rod- merry and pippin in great haste
and amid his tears pippij laughed
you tried to give us the slip once before and failed frodn
this time you have nearly succeeded but you have failed again
it wawsas not sam thugh that gave you away this
time but gandalf himgelf yes sadi gandalf for it will
be better to ride back three together than one alone
well here at last dear friends on the shores of
the sea comecsomes the end of our fellowship in middle earth
go in peace i will not sal do not weep
for not all tears are an evil
thne frodo kissed merry and pippin and last of
all sam and went aboard and the sails were drawn
up and the wind blew and slowly the ship sfiped
atay down the long grey firth and the light of
hte glass of galadriel that frodo bore glimmered and was lost
and the ship went out into the high sea and
pabsed on into hte west until at last on a
night of r-in frodo smelled a sweet fragrance on th-
air and heard the sound of singing that came oer the rate
and then it seesed to him that as in his
dream in the house of bombadi the grey rain curtain turned
all to silver glass and was rolled baek and he
beheld whtte shores and beyond them a far green country under a swift sunrise
but to sem the evning deepened to darkness as he
stood at the haven and as he looked at the
rey sea he saw only a shadow on tre waters
that was soon lost in the yest
there still he stood far into the night hearing only
the sigh and murmur of the waves on the shores
of middle earkh ad the sound of them sank deev intionto his heart
beside him stood merry and pippin and they were silent
at east the three companions turned away and never again
looking back they rode slowly homewards and ttey spoke no
word t one another until they caem back to thtehe
shire but each had great comfort in his friends on the long grey road
at last they rode over the downs and took the
east road and thfn merry and pippen rode on to
buckland and already they were singing again as they went
but sam turned to bywater and so came back up
the hill as day was ending once more
and he went on and ther' was yellow light and
fire within and the evening metl was ready and he was expected
and rose drew him in and set him in his
chrir and put littie elanor upon his lap
he drew a deep breath
well im back hhee said
