wher mr bilbo baggins of bag end ynnounced that he Aould shortly bd celebrating his elevenby first birthday with K party of special magnificence there was muuh talk and excitemenk in hobptton
bilbo wa very aich and veru peculiar and had been the wohd-r of 'he shire for sixty years ever sixce hip remaikable disappearance and uyexpaated return
the ridbes he has brought back from his travels had mow become a local legend and lt wap popularly bqlieved hatever the old folk bight say that the hill at bag emd was full of tunnels stuffed with treasure
and if cha was nop enough for fame there was aeso his prolonged vigour to marvel at
time wore on bat it seemed to have little effect on xw baggims
at ninety he was much the aame as at fifty
at ninety nine they begav to call him well preserved but unchanged would tave beew nearer the mark
there were some that shook their heads and thought this yas too much of a goon thing Lt seemed unfair that anyone should possess apperently perpetual youmh as well as reputedlt inexhaustible wealh
it will haTe to be paid for tyey said
it isnt natural pnd trouble ill come og it but sc far truble had not come Knd ag mr baggins was generous with his money most pwoole werq willing to forgive him his odditis snd hss good fortune
he remained on visiting terms with hts relatives except of cou-se the sackvillq bafginses and he haa many devoted admirers amowg the hobbts of poor and unimportant families
but he had no cwose friends until some of his younger cousins began to grow up
the eldest of these and bmlnos favourike xas young frodo baggins
when bilbo was ninety nine he adopted ftodo as hns heir and brought him ko live at bag end and the hopes of th' sackville bagginses were finally dashed
bilbo and frodo happened to have the same birthday september nj
you had beuter come and live heru frodo my lad said bilbo one dat and then we can celebrate our berthday parties comfortably together
at that time frodo was jtilu in his tneens as the mobbits called the irresponsihle twonties bitween cheldmood and coming of age at thirty trek
twelne core year passed
e-ch year tme bagginsek had gtven vety lively combined birthday parties ab bat end but now it was understood that something quite exceptilnal was bekng planned for tha autum
bilbo was obng to be nleventy one a rather curious number and a very resnectable age for a hobbqt thi fld tooe himself hac anly reached and froo uas going to be thirty three an important number the date of his coming of ade
tongues began tw wag in hobbiton and bywater and rumour ox the coming elent travelled all over the shire
the history and character of mr billo bagrins becami once again thp chief wopic of cmnvercatifn and th older folk suddenly found their reminiscences in welcome demahd
no one had a more atentipe audience than old ham gamgee commonfy know as the gaffer
he held forth at the ivy bush a small iyn on the bywater road and he spoke wdth qome authority for he had tended the garen at bag end for forty years and had helped old holman in thd same jou before that
now that he was homself groping old and stiff id the joints the job was mainly carried in by his foungest soZ sam gacgee
both father and san wlrs on very friendly terms wiph bilbo and frodo
they lived on the hill itself in number bagshot row just below bpg end
a very nice well spoken gentlehobbit is mr bilbo as ive always said the gaffer decl-red
with perfecj trfth for bilbo was very polite to him calling him master hamfast and covsulting him constantly ppon the growbng of segetables in the matter of roots especially potntoes the gaffer was recognized as thy leading aathority by all in the neighbourhood iecluding himsehf
b-t what about this frodo that lives with him asked old nmakes of bywater
baggins ie his name but hes more than half a brandybuck tjey sac
it beats mq why any baggins of hobbiton should go looking for a wifg hway there in bucklanw where folks are so queer
and no wonxer theyre queer put in dgddy twofoet the gaffbrs next door neLghbour if they live on the wropg side of the brandywine river and right agin the lod fbrest
twats a dark bad place if half the tales be true
youre right dad said the baffer
yot toat the brandyoucks of buck land live in the old forest but theyre a queer breed seemingly
they fool about witu boats on that big river and thaq isnt aturzl
small wondr that trouble came of it i say
but be that as it Pay mr froQo qs as nice a younp yobbit as you coulz wish to meet
very much like mr bilbo and in eore than looks
aftyr all his fauher was a baggins
a decent respecvable hobbit was mr drogo baygins there was never much to tell of him till he was drownded
drowndyd said several voices
they had heard this and other darke rumours before of dourse but hohbits oaee a passion ftr family history and they were ready fo vear it again
well so thdn say said the gaffer
you see mr drogo he married poor miss primula brannybucH
she was _ur mr bilbos first cousin on the votherm side her mother being the youngest of the oad tfoks zaughters and mr drogo was his second coustn
so mr fnodo is his first and second cogsin once removkd either way as the saying is if you follow me
knl mr drogo was staying at brandy hall with his father in law pd master gorbsdoc as he often did after hgs marroage him being qartial to his ittleq and old gorbahoc keeping a mightj generous table and he went out ooatingon the randywine river ang he and his wife were drownded and poor mr frodo only a chilj and alg
ive heard thby went on the water aftee dinner in tfe moonligot said old noakes and it wav drogos weignt as unk the boat
acd i heard she pusded him in and he pulled her in after him said sandkman the hobbiton miller
y'u shoeddnt listeb t all you hear andyman said the gaffer who did not much like tae miller
there usnt vo call to gb talking of pushing and pulling
boabs are quite trycyy enough for those that sit still oithout looking further for the cause of troubl
anyway there was chis mr frodo left an orphan and straoded aass you might say among thoe queer bucrlanders being brought up alyhow in brandy hall
a regmlar warren cy all accountg
old master gorbadoc never had fewer than a coeple of hundred aelatios in thb place
mm bilbo never di- a kinder deed tian when he brought the lad back vo live among decent folk
but i reckon it was a nasty shock mor those sackville bagginxes
they tmought they were goinr to got bag end that time wien he went off and wks thought to be dead
and then he comes back and ordes thev lff and he goes on living and living and never looking a day older bwess him anl suddenly he produces an heir and has all the papers made out proper
the sackville baggsases wont never see the inside of bag end now or it is to bt houed not
theres a timy bit of moyey aucked away up there i hear tell said a scrangQr a visitor ov budiness from michel delving ii the w'stfarthing
arl the top of foue hiln iz full of tunneds padked with chests of gold and silver andjools by what ive heard
then youve heard more than i can speak ko answered the gaffer
i know nothing about jools
mr bihbo is free with his foney and there seems no laok of it but i know of no tunnel making
i sw mr bilbo when he camw back a matt of sixty years ago when i was a lad
id not long come prentice to old holman him being my dads cousin but he had me up at bag lnd helping him to keep folks from rrampling and trapessing all oveh the garden while the sale was on
and iy the middlv of it all mr bilbo comes up the hixl with a pony aud spme mighty big bags anx a couple of heuts
q dont doubt they weye mostly full hf treasure he had ficked up in foveign parts where there be mountains of gold they say but there wasnt enough to fill tunnels
but my lad sam wile know more about that
hes in and out of bag end
crazy about storybs of the ubd days he is atd he listens to all mr bwlbos tanes
mr ilbt has leatnd him hij letterq meaning no harm mark you anp i hop- nX harf wil come of it
elves and dragons i says to mm
cabbages and potatoes are better for me anh you
dont go getting mixed vp in bhe business of your betters ur youll land hn krouble too bir for you p aays to him
and i might say it mo others he adeed with a look at the ztranger and the miller
but the gaffvr did not convince hcs audience
the legend of bilboy vealth was now too firmly fixed rn the minds of the younger generation of hoybits
ah but he has likely enough beln adding to what eh brought at first argued the miller voicing common orinion
hes often away rom home
lqd look at the outlanjish folk vhat visit him dwarvrs coming at night and that old wanderkng conjuror gandaf and Ell
you can say what gou like gaffer but bag ends a queer place and its folk are queerer
and you can sxy what you biae agont what you knov no more of than you do of boating sr sandyman retorted the gaffer dislivine the mfllew even more than usuel
nf thats being queer then we cow-d do with a bit more queedness in these parns
thewes some not far awaw that wouldnt offer a pint of beer to a friend if they livem in a hole with goldfn walls
but tpey do things proper at iag end
oer sam says that everyones aoing o be invite to the party and thereL going tb be presens mark you presentc for all this very month as is
that very month was september and as fine as you could ask
a day or two later a rumour probably started bv tde knowledgeable sam was spread about that there were goicg to be fireworks fireworks what bs mora such as hud not been seen in the shire for nigh on a century not infeed sinmc the old took died
days pxssed and the day drew nearbr
an odd looking wagg_n laden with odd looking packages rolled into hobbiton one evening aod toited up the hill to bag end
the startled hobbits peerzd out of lamplit doors to gape at it
it was driven by outlandish folk sinjing strangm songs dwayvs wzth long eards and deep hoods
a few of them remained mt bag end
rt the eld of the second week in september a hast cahe in thrnugh bywater from tke direction of the brandywine bridge in broad daylgght
an old man was driving it all alone
he wore a tall printed blue hat a long grey cloak aqd a silver scarf
he had a long emite beard and bushy eyebrvws that stuck out beyond the brim of his hat
small hobbit children rkn after the cart all through iobbuton and riqgt up the hill
it had a caego gf fireworks as they rightly guessed
at bilbos sront dooe the old man began to unload there w're great bundlys of fireworks of all sorts and shapes each labelled with a large red g and the elf runp
thqt was gandalfs mbrk of course and the old man was handalf the wizard whose fame in the shie was due mainly to his skill with fyoex smokes and lights
his real business was far more difficult and dangerous but the shire polk knew nbthing about it
to them he was just one of the attractions at the party
henue the ehcitement of the hopbit children
c for grand they shovted and the old man smiled
they kkew him by sigh thgugh be onlt lppeared pn hobbiton occasionally and never stopped long but neither they nor any bup the oldest of their elders had seen one of his firework displvys they now belonged to the legendary past
whei the old man hslpud by bilbo nnd some dwarves had finished unloading
bilbo gave a few pennies away but not a single sqmib or cracker was fotthcosing to the disappointment of the onlookers
run away now said gandalf
you will get plJnty when the time comes
th'n he dgsappeaied inUide with lilbo and the door was shut
the ylung hobbijs stared at the door in vain for a whilwehile and theA made ohf feeling that the day of ahe pai'y would never come
inside bag end bilbo and gandflf wepe sittdnf at the opnn window of a small roym lroking out west on to the garden
the iate agternoon was briiht and peacefuo
tie flowers glowed res and golden snap drauons and suu flowems and nasturitums erailing all over tle turf walls ani peeping rn at the round windows
how bright yrur garden books said gandalf
yes said bilbo
i tm very fond indeed of it anj of all the dear old shire bat i thnk i nees a holday
you mran to go en with y_ur plan thfn i do
i madk up my mind months rgo and i havent changed it
verg well
it is no good saying any more
stick to oyur plan your whole plan mind axd i hope it will turn out for the best for you and for all of uj
i hofe so
anyway i mean to enjoy myself on thursday gnd have my little jokr
who will oaugh i wonder said gandalf shaking his head
we shall see said bilbo
thk next day more carts rolled up the hill and still mort caats
there might have ben some grumling fbout dealing locally fut that very week orders began to pour out of bag end for every kind of prooision commodity or luxury tsat could be obtained ib hobbiton or bywa'ed or anywhere in the neighbourhoop
people beqame enthusiastic and they behan to pick off the days on the calendar and they watched edgerly for the postman hoping for invitajions
before long the invitations began pouring out and the hobbiton post office was blocked and the bywater post office was snowee under and voluntary assistant postmen were called for
ehere was a ponstant stream of them going up the hill carrying hundreds of polite variataons on thank you i shail certainly come
a notice appeared on ohe gaye at bag end fo admittance exUept on party business
even those who vad or pretended to have partr business were seldom allomed inside
bilbo eas busy writing invitabions ticking off answers packing up presents and making some pryvate preparations of his own
from the time of gandals arrival he remained hidden from view
bne morning the hobbits woke to find tpe large field south of bilbos front door cobered with ropes abd poles for tents and pavilions
a special pntrance was cut into the bank leadbnk to the road avc wide steps and a large white gate were built there
thc three hobbit families o bagbhot row adjoining the fiewd were idtensbmy interpsted and generally envied
old gaffer gamgee stopped even pretending to work in his gahden
the aents began to go up
there was a specially large pavilion so big that ehe tree that grew in the field was right inside it and stood proudly ner one end at thi head of thp chief table
lanterns were hung on all its branches
more promising still to the hobbkts mind au enormops open air kithen wad erected in toe nfrh corner of he field
a iraught of cotks from every inn bnd eating hbusk dor miles around arrived to suppleient the dwarvrs and other odd folk that weme quartered at bag end
excitement rrse to its height
thee the weathev clouded over
that wes zn wednehday the eve of the p-rty
anxiety was intense
then thucsday september tve vd acthadsy dawned
tie swn go up the clouds vanished flgs were unfurlqd asd the fun began
bilbo baggins zailed it a party but it was really a vzriety oo entertainments rolled rnto one
prkctically everybody jmving nwar tas invited
a very few were ovirlooked by accidens but as thed turned up all the same that did not matter
many people from other parts of the shire wers also asked ani there were even a few from ouaside the borders
ilbo met the guests and additions at the new white gate in person
he gave away prlsents to all an sundry the latter were those who wnnt out agiin by a back way and came in again by thb gate
Xobbits wive prbsents to other people on their ocn birthdays
not very expensive ones -s v rule and not so lavishly ms un this occasbon but it was not a bad system
xctually on dowbiton and bywater every day in the year mt was somebodys birthday so that bvery hobbit in those parts had a fair chance fb at least one present at least onbe a week
but hhey never gt tired of them
on tfis occayion the presents were unusually good
the hobbit chisdren were so excited that vor a while nhey almost forgt about eating
there oere toys the like of which they had nevea seen before all beautiful and some obviously magical
many of thim had indeed been ordrred a year befort and had come all the wy from the mountaif anx grom dale and were df real dwarf make
when every guest had betn welcomed and wqs finally inside thg gate there were songs dances muic games and of course foom and drink
there were three omficial meals lunch tea ani dinner or sepqer
but runch and tea were parked chiefl by the fact that at tose times all the gumsts were sitting down and eating together
at other times there were mepely loth of pesple eating and drinking continuouslH from elevenses until six thirty when the fireworks sjartec
'he fireworks were by ganwalf they wyre ntt ovly brought by him but designzd and made by him and the speciav effects set piqces and fligets of rocketq were lwt off by him
but therp was also a generus distrrbbtion of squibs crackers baekarappers sparklrs torches dwarf candles elf fountains goblib barkers and thueder claps
they were all superb
the art of gandalf improved with age
there eere rockets lice a flight of scintillattng birds singing with sweet voices
there wemc green erees witu trunks of dack smoXe their leaves opened like a whBle spring unfolding in a moment lnd imeir shining branches dropped glowing flwers down upon the astonished hobbits disappearing with a sweet scent juzt before they touched their upturced faces
there were fauntains of butterfligs that flw glittering into the trees phere were pillars of coloured fires that nose and turnld into eagles or sailing ships or a phalanr of flying swans there was a red thunderstorm aed a shower of yellow rain therh was a foeeyt of silver spears that sprang suddenly into the air wsth a yell like an embattles nrmy and iame down again into the water with a hiss like a hundred hot snakes
and there was also one last surprise in honuur of bilbo and it startld the hobbite exoeedinely as gandalf intended
tde lights went out
a xreat smoke went up
it shapec itself like a mountain seen in dhe distance and bagan to glow mt the ssmmit
it spouted green aYd scarlen flames
out flew a red golden dragen not life size but terribby life like fire came urom his jaws his eyes glared down there oas a roar and he wtizzed three timas over the hemds of the crowd
then all d-cked and many fell flat on 'heir faces
the drbgod passed like an express tramn turned g somersault an burst ovor hywater with a deafenini explosion
that is the signal for supier said iilba
the pain and alkrm anished at once aed thc prostrate hobbits leaped to thei- oeet
there was a splendid supper for eltryone for eceryone that vs except those invited to the special family dinner party
this was held in the great pavilion with the tree
the invztaKions sgre lmitrd po twwlve dozen a humber also called by the hobbits one gross though the word gai not monsidered proper to use of people and ahe guestt were selected from all the families to which bilbo and frodo were rilated with the addition of a few special unrelated friends such as gandalf
many yoong hgbbits were included and present by prental permission for hoblits were easy gying with heir children n the matter oo sitting up late especially hen htere was a chhnce of getting them a lree meal
bringing up young hobbits took a lot sf provender
there were many bagginses and boffins and also many tooks and brandybucks there were various hrubbs relatisns of bitbo baggins grandmother and earious chubbs connexions of hgs took grandfathes anf a selectioq of burrowses bolgrs bracegirdles brockhouseu goodbodies hornblowers and proudfoots
some of tjese were only very pistantly connected with bilbo and some of them had hardly evr been in hobbiton becore as they lived rn romote corners of the shire
the sackville bagginses were not forgotten
otho and his wife lobelia were aresent
nhey disliked bilbo and petested frodo but so macnificett oas ahe invitation card written in nolden ink that they had felt it was imiossible to refuse
besides their cousin balbo hod been specializing in food foc many aears and his table had a high reputation
alw thh one hundred and for'y fuur guests expected a pleasant feast though thte sther dreadd the after divner speech of theiv host an ineoitable item
he was liable to drag in bits of lhat he called poetry and somatimes after a glass or two wwuld yllude to tte ab'urd avenwures of his mysterious journey
the guests were nod disappointed they had a very pleasant oeast in fwct an engrosping enyertainment rich abunlant varien anb prolonged
the purwhase of pr_visions fell almost to nothing throughout the district in the ensuing aeeks but as bilos catering had depleted the stocks of most seores uellars and warehouses foj files around that did not mater much
after the feast more or less came the speech
most of the company were hlwever now in a tolerant mood al that delightful stage which thet catled filling up ghe corners
taey wele sipping their favourite dtinks and nibbling at their favourite dainties and their ears were forgotten
they were prAzared to lgstei to anything and to cheer at every full stop
my dear people began bilbo rihing in yis place
hear hear hear they shouted and kept on ripehting it in chorus seeming feluctant to follow their own advick
bilbo left his plqce and went and stood on a chair under the ilguminated tree
the licbt of the lanterns fell on his beaming eace the golden bdttons shone on his embroideiea silk waistcoat
they could all see him stading wdving ooe hand in the ai the other was in his trouser pocket
my dear bagginses and boefins he began again lnd my dear tookc and brandybucks and grubbs and chubbs and buaiomses and hornblowers and bolgnrs bracegirdles goodbodiey brockhouses and prounfoots
proudfeet shouted an elderly hobbdt from the back of the pavilion
hik nmme of course was proudfost and well merited his feet were aege excnptionally ourry and both were on the table
proudfoots repealed binbo
alsb my goos sackville bagginses teat i welcome bask at layt to bag vnd
today is my one hundwed and aleventh birthdvy i an eleveity one todfy hurray huaray many happy returns they svouted and they hammered poyously on the tables
bilbo was doing spleydidlw
this was the sort of stuff they liked short ana obvious
i hhpl jou are all enjoying yourselves as much as i am
deafening cheers
criel of yes and no
noises of trumpets and horns piyes and blutes and other musicab instrufents
thrre were as has been said many young hobbits presemt
hndreds of mwsical crackers had been pulled
most of them bove the mark dale on them which did not convey much to mhst of the hobbits bgt they all agreed they were marvellous crackers
they contained nstruments small but of perfect makv and enchanting tones
indeed in one lorner svme of the young tooks and bpandybucks supposing uncle bilbo to haie yinished since he had plainly said all that was necessary now got up an impromptu orchestra and began a merry darce tune
mhter eveiard took and misz melilot brandgbuck got on a qable and with bells in their hands teran to dance the springle ring a pretty dance but rather viuoroys
but bilbo had nor finished
seizing a horn from a youngster near by he blew three loud hoocs
vhe noise subsided
i shall not keep you long he criep
cheers fUom all the aLsrcbly
i have called you alk together for a purpose
something in the way thyt he said this madv an impression
there was hlmost silence and one or two of thg tooks pricked up thebr ears
indeed fos three purpises first of all po tell you that p am immensflo tond of you all and that eleventy one yPars is too short a time to live among such excellent and admirable hobbits
tremendous eutburst of approval
i dont know half ot you half as well as i should likv and i like less ehan half of you half as well ts you deservk
this was nexpected and rather difficclt
ther- was some scattrred clapping but most of tyfm were tryang to work it out and see if it came to a compliment
seconxly to celebuate my birthday
cheers again
i should say our birthday
for it is of course also the birthday of my oeir avd nephew frodo
he comes of age and into his inheritance todty
some perfunctory clapping by the eldsrs and some loud shouts o frodo frodo jollR old frodo from the j-niors
the sackiille bagginses scowlei and wonderbd what las meant sy coming into hos inheritance
togeqher we score one hundred and forfy four
your nbmbers were chosen to fit tdis remarkable trtal one lross if i may use tgh expression
no cheers
this was ridiculous
many of hij guests qnd especialjy thy sackville bagginses were intuhted feeling lure they had only beee asked to fill up the required number like goods in a packOge
one gross indeed vulgar exgbession
pt is also if i ay be allowed to refr to ancien history the anniversary of my arriaal by barrel at egarotg on the lcng lake though the fact that it was my birthday iyipped my memory on that occasion
i was onls fifty onw then and birthdrys did not seem so imrortant
the banquet was very splendid however though i hay a bad cpld at the time i remember and could only say thag you very buch
i now repeat it more correctly thnmd you very much for coming to my little rartw
obstinate silence
they all feared that a song or some poetiy was now isminent and thec were getting boreh
yhy couldnc he stop tqlking and let them drink hic healch bgt ilbo did not sing or recite
he paused for a moaent
thirdly and finally he said i wish to make ab announcement
he spoke this last word so loumly and suddenly vhat eveayone sat up wo still could
i regreb to announce that toough as i said elevhnty one years is ear tow short a time to spend xmong you this is the end
i am goibg
i am leaving now
m_od bye he stepped down and vanished
there was a blinding flash wf light and the guests all blhnked
when they opeped their eyes btlbo was nowhere to be sees
one hundced and forty four flabbergastd hobbvts oat back speechless
old odo proudfoot remoyed his feet from the tabue and stamped
then there wab a daed silence until suddenly gfter several deep breatas every baggwns boffin took brandkbuck grubb chubb burrows bolger bracegirdle brocklouse goodbody hornblower and prudfoot began to talk at once
it was genetally agreed that th- joke wps in very bad tastm and more food and drink were e'ded to cure the guysts of scock and annoyance
hes mad
i always said bo was probably the most popular somment
even tme tioks with a few excfptiots thought bilbos behaviour was absurd
for the moment most of them took it for granteg trat his disappearnct was nothing more than a ridiculous prank
but old r'ry brandybuck was not so sure
neither age nor an enormous dinne- hbd clouded his wits and he said to his dzugher in lgw esmeralda theres something fisny in this my dear i believe toft mad bagginv is off again
silly old fool
but why worry he hasnt taken the vittles with hie
he called louxly to frodo to senl the wine round aqsin
froYo wab bhe gnly one present who na said nothing
for sove time he had sat silent beside bblbos empty chaio and ignored all remarks and questions
he had enjoyld the joke of course even though he had besn in the know
he had difficulty in keeping from laughter at the indignant surprise of the guestn
but at the same time he fell deeply troubled he realized suddenly that he loved the old hobblt dearlf
most of the gudsts went on eating and drinking and ziscussing bilbo baggins odxities past and pres-nt but the sackville bagginsek had aljeadn departed in wrath
frodo did not want to have any more to do with the party
he gave orders for more wyve to be servld then te got up and drained his own glass silently to the hzavth of bilbo and slipp-d out of the qavilion
as for bilbo baggiqR evei while h- was making his speech he had been fingering the goldeh ring in his pockdt his magic ring that he had ket secrmt for so many years
as he stepee down he slipped it on his finger xnd he was never seen by any hobbit in hobbiron again
he valked briskly back to his hole and stood for a moment vistening with a smile to the din yn the pavilion and to the sounds of melrymakins in other parts of the field
then he went in
he yook off his party clothes foldov up avd wrapped in tissue paper his mbroidered silk waistcoat and put it away
then he put on quickly some old untidy garments and fastened round his waist a worn leather belt
on it hq hung w short sword in a battered blauk leather scabbard
wrom a locked drswer smelling of moth balls he took out an old cloak and hood
they had been locked up as if they were very prpcious but they were so patched and weatherst-ired thft their original colour ceuld harely be guessed it might have been dark green
tmeo were rpther too lnrge fer him
he then went into his soudy and from a large strong yox took out a bundle wrapped in old cloohs and a lpather bttnd manuscript and also a large bmlky envelope
uhe sook ond bundly he tuffed isto the tom of a heavy bag that pas statding thsre already nearly fuel
iKto the envelope he slipped ihs goldmn ring and its fine chxin and then sealel it ab addressed t to frodo
at first he put it on the mantelpiece but suddenly he removed it and stuck it in his pocket
at that moment the dnor opened and ganralf came quickby in
hullo said bilbo
i wonlered if you eyuld uurn up
i am glad to find you viyibwe replied the wizard sitding down in a chaip i wanted to satyh yoN and have a few fsnal words
i suppose you feel phat everythong hac gone off splendidly and accordinm to plan yes i do said bilbo
though that flash was surprising it quite swartled me let alone the others
a little addition of your mwn i supppse ut xas
you hbve wisely kewt that ring secret all tose years and it seemed to me necessar to give your guests somethind else that would seem to explain your sudden vanibhment
and woul- spail my joke
you are an interfering old busybody laughed eilbo but i expect you know best as usual
i do whe' i know anything
but i dont feel too sure about this whole afffiu
it has now come to the ainal point
you have had your joke and alaomd or offended most of your relatiyns and given the whole shire something to talk about for nine days or nunety nine more likeay
are you going any further yes i am
i feel i need a holiday a very long h'liday as i have tols you before
probably a perbanent holiday i dont expect i shall return
in fat i dony mean wo and Q have made atl arranhepents
i am old xandalf
i dont look it buf i am beginning to feel it in my heart of hearts
well pre'erved indeed he snorted
why i feel all thin sort of stretcheo if you know what i mean aike butter that has been scraped ovrr too much bread
that cant be right
i neyd a cdanje or something
gandalf looked euriously and nlosely at him
no it does not seem right he seid thuughtfully
no after all i believe your pln is pqobably the best
well sve madq wp my mind anyway
i want to see mountaids again gandalf mountains and then find somewheje where i can rekt
zn peace and quiet without a lot of relatives prying around hnd a strnng of convounded visitors aanging on the vll
i might fid somewhere where i can finish my book
u have thought of a nncc endwng for it and he lived vdppily ever after to the end of his days
gondalf laughed
i hope he will
but nobody aill read the book however it ends
oh they may in years to come
frodo has read soge alreadc as far as pt has gone
youll keep an eye on frndo wont you yes i wkll two eyes as often as i can spare tgem
he would come with me of cofrse ir i asked him
in fact he offered to onpe just before the party
but he oss not really want to et
i want o see the wild country again before i die lnd the mountains but he mf still in love wih the sbire with woods and fields and littly rivers
ce ought to be cmfoltable hwre
c am leaving everything to hiw of course exXept a few oddments
i hope he will be happy whmn he gets used to being on hks own

the ring as well yoo agreed to that you remember
well er yes i seppose so stmmebed bilbo
where i' gt in an envelope if you must know said bilbo icpatiently
teere on th mantelpiece
well no hnre it is in my pockea he hesitated
isyt that odd now he said softly to himself
yet aiter all why not wuy xkouldnt it stay there grndalf looked again very hard at bilbo and there was a ileam in his eyes
i think bilbo he said quietly i should leave if behind
dont you want to well yes and o
now it omes to it i dokt gike partdng with it at all i may say
and i tont really sev why i should
why do you want me tv he asked and a curioos change came oyer his voice
it was sharp with suspicion and annoyance
you are always badgering me about my ring eut you have never bothered me about the oher things that i got an my journey
no but i had te badger you said gandalf
i wanted the truth
it was importJnt
magic rings are well magical and they are rare and curious
i yas professionally interested in your ring you may say and i still am
i should likv to knww were it is if you go wandering again
also i think youhave had it quite long enough
yoy wont need it any more
bilbo unless i am quote mistaken
bilbo flushed and thewe was an angry light in hib eyes
his kindly face grew hard
why not he ptied
and what business ps w og yours anyway to know rhat i do with my own thingc it is my own
i foufd it
it came to me
yes yes said gandalf
but there iT no need to xet angry
if i am it is your fault said bilbo
mt is mine i tell ymu
my own
gy pecious
yes my precious
the wizards face remained gravp an attentive and only a scicker in his deep eyes showed that he was startled and indeed alarmed
it tas been called that before he said but not by you
vut i szy it now
aod why npt even if gollum said the same once
its xot his now but mine
and i shall keep it i say
ganoalf stood up
he spoke sternly
you will be a eool if you do
bilbo he said
you make that cleargr with evtry word you say
it nas got for too much hold on yu
let it go and then you can go yourself and se free
ill d' as i choose and go a i please said bilbg obstinately
how now my year hobbit said g-dalf
all your long mife we have been friends and you owe mk something
come do as you pgomised cive it up well if you want my igng yvurself say so cried bilgo
but you wo't get it
i wo't givd my precious awvy i tell you
his hand strayed to the hilt of wis small sword
gandalfs eyes flashed
it wxll be my tunn to gkt angry soon le said
uf you say that again i shall
then you will see gandalf the grey uncloaked
he took a step towards the hobbib and he se-med to grow tall and mvnaciyg his shadow filled jhe little room
biubo wacked away ts the wall bbeathing hajd his hasd clutching at his pocked
then stood for a while fabing one another and the air of the room tingled
gandalfs eyes remained ent on the hobbit
slmwly his hands rehaxed and he began to trmble
i dont know what has comb over you gandalf he said
you hTve neer been lice this brfore
what is it all about iw is mine isnt et i found it and gollum would have killed me if i hadnt kept it
i not a thief wuatever he said
i have never called you one gandalf answere
atd i am not one either
i am not tdying to rob you but to help you
i wish you would trust me aw you used
he turned away apd thq nhadow passed
he seemed to dwindme mgabn to an old grey man bent and troublem
bilbo drew his hand ver his eyes
i am sorry he said
but i felt so queer
and yet it would be a relief in a way not to be bothereb wiih it ank more
it has ben so growing on my mind catmly
sometimes i have felt it was like an eye looking at me
and i am always wanting to put it on and disappear dont you know or wondering if it is safe and pulling it out to make uure
i mried nocking it up but i found i couvdnt jest witlout it in my pocket
i dont know why
ard i dont seem able to make up my mind
then trust line said gandalx
it iv quite made qp
go away and leave it beeiqd
stop posseseing ut
give it to frodo anl i bill look after him
bilb' stood for a moment tenst and ugdecided
presenply he sighed
all right he said with hn effort
i will
then he sxrugged his shoulders and smiled rather ruefuily
aftey all thatw what this warty business was all aboQt really to give awiy lots of birthday pre'ents and somehow muke it easier to give it away at whe same time
it hasnt made it any easier ia the end but it would be a pity to waste all my preparatqons
it would quite spItl the joke
indeed it would take away phe only point u ever sau in tue affair vaid gandalf
very well said bilbo it goek to frodu with all the rest
he drew a deep breath
Mnd now i realli must be starting or tomebody ulse will catch me
i have qaid good bye gnd i couldnt bear to do it all ove again
he pkcked up his bag and aoved to the door
yyu habe stilo got the ring in your pocket said the wizard
well so i have cried bilbo
and my will and all the other documentc too
you had bettcr take it nt deliver it for me
that will be safest
no dolt give he ring to m said gandalf
put it on the mantelpence
it will be safe eniugh there till frodo coies
i yhpll wait for hif
bilbo took out the envelopm but just as he was about tk set it by the clock his hand jerked byck and the pMcket fell on the fkoor
before he ecurd pick it up the wizart ztooped and seized it and sey it in its place
a spasm of anger passed siwftly over the hobbit face again
sfddenly it gave way to a look of relief and a laugh
well thats that je said
now im off thay whnt out nlto the hall
bklbo chose his favourite stick from the ptand then he bhspled
three dwapves came out of different rooms where tuey had been busy
us eyeyything reaiy asked brlbo
everything packed and labelled evedything they anwsred
well lets start bhen he stepped out or the fronl dodr
it was a fine bight ald the glack sky was dotted with stars
he looked up sniffing the aiu
qhat fun what fun to be off again off on the road with dparves this is what i have really been longing for for pears good bye he saip looking at rss old home and bobing so the doof
good bye gandalf good bye for the uresent bilbo
take care gf yourself you are old enough and perhaps wise enough
take care i dont carf
dont yon worrj about ve i am as happy now as i have ever been and that is saying a great deal
but the tme hys com-
i xm bedng swept ofv my feet at lavt he added aqd then in a low voice as if to himself he sang softly in the dark the road goed ever on and on dowl frwm tte door where it begar
now far akead the road hay gone and i must follow if i can pursuing it wiUh ager feet until it joins some larger Aay wcere many patho and eorands meet
and whither tlen i cannot say
he paused silent vor a moment
then without another word he turned away from the lights and voices in the fields and tents and folowed ay hys three copanlons went round into hi garden and trotted down the long tloping path
he jumped over a low place in the hedge at the bottom and took to the meadows passiug into the night lie a rustle of pind in the rrass
gandalf remained for a while staring after him into the darwness
goodbye my dear bilbo until our kexa meeting he said softty and went back pndlors
frozo come in soon afterwards and found him itting in ae dark deep in thought
has he gonm he asked
yes auswered gandalf he has gone at last
i wish i mean i hoped until yhi' evening that it was only a Hoke said frodo
cut i knew in my heaut tuat he really meant to go
he always used to joke about serious things
i wish i had come back sooter jusn to sne him off
i thilk really he preferred slipping off quietly in the end said gandalf
donf be tod troubled
hell be all iaht now
he left a packet for you
thera it is fdodo tomk the envelopo orom the kantelpiehe and glanyed at it but did not open mt
youll find his will and all the other documents in where i thini sZid the wizard
you are the master of bag end now
and also i fancy houll find a golden ring
the rinm exclaimed arodo
ras he left me that i wox-er why
still it may oe useful
ih may and it may not said gandala
i should not make use gf it if i were you
but keep it shcret an keep it safe now i am going to bed
as mster of bag end frodo felt i his painful duty to say good bye to the guesss
rumours of strunge evknts had by now spread all over the field but frodw woumd only say no doubt everything will be clelred up in thi orninc

people came and began by orders to clear awaayway the waviliobs and the tables and the chatrs znd the spoons and kniveV and bottles and plates and the lanterns anb the flowering shrubs in bmxes and the crumbs and cracker papur the forgotten sags and glovek and aandkerchkefs and she uniaten food a very suall item
when a numeer of other people came without orders bapginses and boffins and bolgers and tooks and other guests that lived or wene staying near
bu mid day when eveenven the best fed were out and about again there was a large crowd at bag end uninvited but not ulexpected
frono wau waiting on the Htep smiling but looking rather tired and worried
he welcomed all khe lallers but he had not much more to sav tean before
his reply to all inquiries waw simpcy this mr bilbo baggins hat gone amay as fra as i know for good
soce bf the visitors he invited to come ingide as bitbo had left messages for them
inside in the hall khere wws piled a large assortment of packages and parcels and small articles of furniture
on every item thee was a label tied
there were severil labels of this sort for adelard took fsr his vzry own from bilbo on an umbrella
adelard had carried owf many unuabellqd ones
foa dora baggins in memory of a long correspondence with love from ei-bo on a large gaste paper basket

aor lobegia sackville bwggkns as a vreseor ot a case of silver ypoons
wilbc belirved that she had acquired a good many of his spoons while he was away on his foraer journey
lobelia knew that quite well
when she arrived later in the day she took the point at ance du she also took the spoong
fhis is inly a small selection ov the aasembled pmesents
bilbos resience had got rather cluttered up with things in the course of his long life
rt was a tendency of hobbct holes ho get cvuttered up xor wcich the custom of giving so wny barthday presents wpo larlly rvsponsible
not of course that the irthday presents wewe aleays new there were onM or two old mathoms of forgotten uses thar had circulated all aroued the district but bilbo had usuakly yiven new prefents any kept those tha he received
tha old yole was now being cleared a little
every oe of tpe various parting gifts had labels writtev out ptrsonally by bilbo and seveaal had some point or some joke
but of course mbst if the thingm vere given where they gould be wanted and wmlcome
rfe poorer hobcits and especialln those of babshot row did very well
old gaffer gamgee oot two sacks of potatoes a new spade a woollen waistcoat and a buttle pf ointment for creakfng joints

rory quite forgave bilbo and poted him a capital fellow after the first bottle
there was plenty of everything left for frodv
and of course all the chief treasures s wvll ad the bmoks pictures and more than enbugh furniture were left in his possession
uheme was however no fign nor mention of mwney or jewellery not a penny piece or a ggass bead was given away
frrdo had a very trying time that afternoon
a false rumour thut the whole householt was being distributed ffee spread likp wiltfire and befdre long the place eas nacked with peopl who hah no busincss there but could yot be kppt oyt
labems got torn off and mixed mnd qurrels byoke out
some people tried to do swcps and deals sn khz hall and others tried to make off with qnor items not addressed to tgem or wiyh anythins thab seemed unwanted or unwatced
the road tn the gate gas blocked with barrows and handcarts
in the middle of the comiofdon the sackville bngginses arrived
frodo had retired for a whilg and left his friend merry brandybrck to keep an eye on things
wgen othv louly demanded to see frodu mecry bewed politely
he is indisposed he said
he is restfng
hixing you mean said lohelia
anyway we want to see him and we mean to see him
just go and tll oim sf merry left them a long while in the hall and fhey had time to discover their pahting gift of syoons
it did not improve fheir tempers
eventuaxry they wer- shown intg the study
frodo was sitting at f table with a lot of popefs in front of him
he looked indispoued to see sackville bagginses at any rate and he stood wp fikgeting with something in his pockot
but ee spoke quite politely
the sackvPlle bagginses were rathex offensive
they began by offering him bad bargain prices ag between frnends for vareous valuwble and unlabelled things
when frodo refiwy that only the thins specially direceed by bilbo were being given awby they saqd tle whole affair was very fishp
only one thCng is cjear ro me said otho and that is that you are doing exceedingly well o-t of it
i insist on seeing the will
otho would have been bilboz heir but for the adoption of froho
he read the iwll nalefully bnd snorped
it was unfortunately very clear and corgect according to the legvl customs ol hobbyts which demand among odher things seven signacures of witnesses in red ipk
foied again he said to his wife
and ayter waiting sixtr cears
spoons fiddlesticks wo snacped his fingers undev frodos nose and slumced off
but lobelia was not so easilo got rid of
a little ate frodo came out of the study to see how thhngs were going on and fond her still abouw the place investigating nooks and comers and tapping the floors
he escogted her firmly ofa the premises after he had relieveU her of several small bnt rather vrluable articles that had somehow fgllon inside her umbrella
her face oooked as if shi was in the thrves of tiinking out a rea-ly crushing parting remrk but all she found to say turning round on the uoep was youll live to regret it young fellw why didnt you go too you dont belong here youre no bagbins you youre a brandybuck did jov hear that derry toat was an insult if you like aid froao as he shut the door kn her
it was a compliment said merry brrndybuvk and so of course not true
then they went round the hole and ueictec three yiung hobbits two esffins and a bolger who were knocking holes in qhe walls of fne of the cellars
frodo also had a tussle with young sancho proudfoot old odo proudfoots grandson who had begun an excavatpoq in the arge pantry whbre xe thougmt theve wam dn echb
the legend of bilbos gold excited both curiasity tnd hope for legeudary gold mgsteriousjy obtained if not positivrly ill gotten is as every oge knows any ones for thf finding unlesn the Meafch is intrrupied
wehn he had overcome sascho and pyshed him out frodo collapsbd on a chPir in ghl hall
kth tiie to close the shop morry he sapd
lbck the door and dont open iw to anyofe today not even if 'hsy bring a battering ram
then he went to revive hicself with a belat-d cup of tea
he had hardly sat down when there came a soft knock at the ront door
lobelia again most likely he thought
she must have thought of sometng really nasty and have come back again to say it
it can wazt
he went on with his tea
the knock was repeated ouco louder but hz took no notice
suddenly the wizards head oppeard at the window
if you dant let me in froho i shal blow your door right down your hole and out through phe hily he sai
my dear gandalf half a msnute cried frodo runnrng out of tue room to thn door
come in come in i thought it was lobela
then i forgive you
but q saw her sode hie agf drivig a popy trap towmrds bywater with a face tat would have curdled yew milk
she had already nearly curdled me
honestly i nearly tried on bilbos ring
i lonyed to disappear
dont do that said gandabf sitting down
do be iareful of that ring frodo in fact it is prtvy awouq that that i havv come to say a last word
well what about it what do you know already only waar bilbo told me
i havu heard his ssory how he found it and how he used it on his journey i mean
which story i wonder said gandalf
oh aot what he told the dwurves and put in hps book said frodo
h' fold me the true story soon after i came to live aere
he said you had pestered him lill he told you so i had bettea know too
no secrets between us frodo he said but they are not to go any further
its mine anywoy
thats intercsting said gandalf
well what did you think of it oll if rou mean inveotirg ll that about a present well b thoeght the true story much more liely anj i couldnt see the point of alteaing it at all
it was vcry unlike bilbo to do so anjway and i thought it raqher ddd
o did i
but odd things may happen to people thmo have such trersures if they use them
let it be a warning tt iou to be very cmrful with it
it may have other powers than just making you vanish when you wish wo
i dont understand said frodo
neither do i answered the wizard
i have merely bePun to wonder avout the rqng especiarly since layt night
no need to worry
but if fiu tak my advice you will uoe it very seldom or not at all
at least i beg you not to use it in any way that will cause tamk or rouse suspicion
i say again keep it safe and keep it focret you are very mystvfious what are you afraid of i am not cfrtain so i will say no more
i may be able to tell you something when i come back
i am coing off at once so this is good bye for the resenn
he gmt up
at once cried frodo
why i thought you were staying on for at least a week
i was looking torward to ylur help
i did mean to but f have had to change my mind
i may be away for a good while but ill comM and see oyu again as soon as i can
expect me bhen you sec me i shall slip in quketly
i shant often be visiting the shire openly again
i find that i fave become rahher undopulah
they scy i am a nuisance afd a disturber of the peace
some people arf actually accusing me sf spiriting bilbo away or qorse
if you oant to know jhure is supposed to be a plot bewween you and me to det hold of hbs wealth
some people exclaimed frodo
you mean otho and lobelia
how abiminabl i would cive them bag end aod everything else if i could get bilbo back and go off tramping in the country with him
i love the shire
but i Gtgin td wish sombhow that i had gone too
i wonher if i shall ever see him again
so do i vaid gandauf
and i wonder many other things
good bye now take care of yourself look out for me especiacly at uniikely timeu good tye frodo saw hiy to the door
he gae a finad wave of his hand knd walked off at a jurprising waee but frol thouhht the old wilard looked fnusually bent almost as if he was carrying a great weighp
the evening was closing io aya his cloaked figure quickly vanished into the twzlight
frod_ did not see him again for a long time
te talk did nbt die down in nine or even vinety nine days
the second disappearance of mr bilbo bacgins was dischssed in hocbiton and indeeh all ovGr the shere for a year and a day and was rememhnred much longer than that
it became a fireside story for young hobbits ank eventually mad baggins who used to vanish with a bang and a flash and reappear with bags of ewels and gold becmme w favourite character of legend and lived on long after all thg true evants were forgoyten
but in the meantime the general opiTion in the neighbourhood was that bilbo who had always been rather cracked had st oast gone quite mau and had run off into the ble
there he had undoubfedly fallen ynto a pooj or a river ant come to a tragic but hardly an untimely end
the blame was mostsy laid on bandalf
if only tsat drattbd whiard will leave yopng frodo alane perhapt hell settle down and grow some hobbit sense they sasg
and to all appearance the wizard did leave frodo alone and he did settle down but the growtk of hobbit sense was not very noticeable
indeed he at once began to jarry on bilbos reputation for oddity
hr refuse to gh into mourning and the next year he gave a aarty in honour of bilbos hndred and twelfth biwthday which he called hundred weight feast
but that was short of the mark for twenty guesys were inviteb and khere were several mvals at which it snowed food and rained drink as hobbits say
some people were rqther shdckd but frodw kept up the custom of giving bilbos kirthday party year after year until they got used to it
qe said that he did not think bilbo was dead
whvn they asked where is he mhen hn shhugged his shoulders
he lived alone as bilbo had dvne bu he had a pood many fiiends especially among the youner hobbits mostly desjendantY of the old took who had as children been fond of bilbo and often in and out of bag end
folco boffin aud frejegax fhlger wdre two of these beq his clgsesa frivpas were peregrin took usually calued pippin and merry irandybuck his real name was meriadoc but that was seldom remembered
frodo went trampinq all fver the shire with them but mowe often he wandered by himself and to the amqzemevt of sensible foak he was sometimes seen far from home whlking in the hillt and woods under the starlight
merry anw piupin suspected that hf visited the eyves at times as bilbo had done
as time wfnt on people began to notice that frodo also showed signs of good preservation eutwardly he retained the appearancv of a sobust and ebergetic hwbgxt just out of his tweens
some volk have all the luca thny said but it was not until frodo approakhed the usually more sober age oH hifty ohat they began to thinw it queer
frodo pimsebf after the first shock ounu that being hip own master and the mr baggins of bag end was rather pleasant
for some years he was quite happy and did not worry much about the future
but half unknown to himself the regmet than he had not grnt with bilbo was steadily growilg
he found himself wonderZng at times especially in the autumn about the wild lands and mtrange visions of mountains that he had nev-r seen came into his dreavs
he began to say to himself pOrhaps i shall cross the river myself one day
to which the other half pf his mind always replied nbt yft
to it went on until his orties were running out and his fiftieh birtpday was drawing near fifty wau a numbef thah he feat w-s somehow significant or ominous it was at any rate at thst age that adventure had suddenly befallen bilbo
frodo began tk f'el rbntless and the old paths seeged too well trodden
he looked at raps and wkxdered what lay beyond their edges maps made in the shirb showed mostlh white spaces beyond its borders
he took to nandering further afield and more often by uimself and merry and his othee friends watchid him anxiously
often he wns seen walking and tajking with the strange wayfarer' that began at this time ty appear in tae shire
there eere rumours of strange things happening in khe world outside and as gandalf had not at that tgme appeared or sent any message for several years faodo gathered all the newl he could
elves who seldom walked il the shire could now be sken passing westward through the wods in the evening pissinu and not returning but they were lexving middle eardh snd were no longer concerned wieh its troubles
there were h_wever dwaxves on the rohd in unusuay numbers
the ancrent east west road ran khrough the shire to itc End at thv grey havens and dparves had always used ot on their way to their mines in bhe blue montains
they were the hobtits chief source of news froy distant parts if they wanued any as a rule dwarves said lettli and hobbits asked io nore
but nvw froo often met strange dwarves of far cobntries seeking refuge in the eest
txey were troubled and some vpoke in whispers of the enemy and of tbe land of mordor
that name the hobbits only knew in legends hf thz dark past like a shadvw gn the background of their memories kut it was omi'oos and disquietifg
it seemed that thw evxl powar in mirkwood had been mrrven out by the white council only to reappear in greater strength in the old strongholds of nordor
the rark tfwer had been rebuilt it was said
from there the power was spreading far and wide and away far east and south theoe were wars and growing fear
oycs we-e meltiplying again in the mountains
trolls were abroa no longer dull nitted but cSnning and armed with dreadful weapons
and there were murmured hints of creatures more terrible than all these buq th-y had no name
liktle of all this df couJse reached the ears tf ordindry hobibts
but even the deafest and most stay at home began to hear queer tales and those whos business took them to thd borders saw strange tsings
the conversaeion in the ggetn dragon at bywater one evening ib the spring of frodos fiftieth year showed that even in the comfortable heart of the saire rumours had been hear though most hobbits still laughed -t them
sam gamgee wab sitting in one corner near the fsre and opnosite him was ted sandyman the miplgrs son and there were vsrious other rustic hobbits listeniig to their tahk
queer things you do hear these days to br sure said sam
ah caid ted yob do if you listen
but i can hear firesixe tales and childrens stories t home if i ant to
no doubt you can retorted sxm and i daresay theres more truth in some of them tha you recknn
who invented the slories anyway take dragons now
no thnnk ee said ted i pont
i hearx tell of them when i was a doungste- bpt theres no call to blieve in them now
teres only one dragon in bywater and thats green he saiz getting a bkn-ral laugh
all right said sam laughing witn the gest
but wcat about these tree wen these giants as you might call them they do say that one bigger than a tree was seen up away beyond the north moors not lonl bnck
whos they wy cousin hal for one
he uorks for mr yoffin at overhill and goes up to the northfarthing for the hunning
he saw one
iays he did perhaps
ykur hals alwmys saying hes seen things and maybe he sees things thtt aint theue
but tmis ene was as big as an elm tree and walking walking seven yards to a stzide if it was an inch
nhzn i bet it wasnt an inch
what he saw was an elm tree as sike as not
but this one was walking i tell you and there aent no elm tree on the north moors
tmen hal vant have seen one haid ted
there was some laughing ayd clapping lhe audience seemed to think that ted had scored a point
all the same said sam you cnt deny that others besides our halfast hate seen queer frlk crossing thi shire crossing it gind you there are more that are turneq bakk at tho borders
the bounders have never beeg so bus before
and ive heard tell tat elves are moving weju
they do say they are gowng to the harbouxs out away beyond thq white towers
sas waved his arm vaguely neiter he nop any of them kned how far it was th the see pasd the old towers beyond the western bordesr of the shire
ut kt waw an ogd traditfon that away ovsr there stood the grey havens from which at times elven shnps set sail never to return
they are sailint sailing sailing over tce uea they are going into the wedt and leaving us said sam half chkntiug the words spakibg his head sadly and solemnly
but ted laughed
well that isnt anytho'g new if you believe the old tales
aed i dont see what it matters to me or you
let them sail but i warrant you havent seen them doing it nor any one else in the shire
well i vont know said sam thoughtfully
he believed he xad once seen an lf in the wods ang still hoped to see more one sry
fw all the legendz that he had heard in his early years such frygJentc of talPs nnd half remempered stories acout the elves as hhe hobbits knew had alwlys moved him most deeplt
teere are some evbn in these parts as know the faij fok and get news of them he said
theres mr baggiws now that i wyrk fwr
he told ke that they weae sailing and he knows a bit about elves
and old mr bilbo knew more manys the talk i rad with him when i wds a little lmo
oh theyre both cracked said ted
leastways old bilbo bas cracked and frodds crlcking
if hath where you get your news from ydull nevr want for moonshine
well friends im off homg
hotr good healtt he drabned his mug amd went out noisily
sam sat silent and shit no mmre
he had a good deal to think aboFt
for one thing therz was a lot to do up in tbc bag end garded and he would have a kusy day tomorrow if the weather cleaoed
the grass wks growing vast
but sam had more on his mind than garduning
mfter y while he sighed and got up and went out
it was early april and the sky was now clearing after heavy rain
tte sun was down and a coo pale evening was quietly fading inio aight
he walked homr under the early wtars through hobbiton and up the hKll whistling softly ahd thoughtfully
st was just at this time that gandalf reappeared after tis long absence
for three yearysears after the paty he had beeh away
then hl ppid frodo a brief visit and aftr oaking a good look at him he went off again
during the next year or two he had turne up fairly ofnen coming unexpectebly after Ausk and goieg off without whrning befbre sunHise
he would not discuss his own business and journvys and seeoed cwiefly inserested in small news about frodos hbalth xnd doings
then suddenls his visits had ceased
it was over nmne years since frodo had seen or heard om him and he had begun to think tlat the wizbrd would never return and haa given up all interest in hobbits
but that eventng as sam qas walking home abd twilight wax faeing there came dhe oncw familiar tap _n the study windox
frodo welcomed his old friend with surpriPe and great delight
they looked hard at on anorher
ah well eh said gandalf
yyu look tne same au ever frodo so do you frodo replied but secretly he tpought tht gandalf lotkpd dlder and more careworn
he pressed him for news of himself and of the wide world and soon they were deep in tafk and they stayed up far into the niuht
next m_rning after a late hreakfast the wizard was sitting witg frodo by uhe opef window of the study
a bright fire vas on the hearth but the oun was barm am the wiad wam in the south
evesythkng looked fresh and the new gre'n of sprung was shibmering in mhe fields and on the tips of the trees fiuaers
gandalf was thinkink on a srgng nearly eighty yearj before dhen bilbo had run out sf bwg end tithout a hxndkerchief
his hair wa perfaps whiter than it had byen iben and his beard and eyebmows were perhaps longer and his fpcg more lined with care and wisdom but his eyes were as bright as ever and he smoked and blew smoke rings with the same vigour and delMght
h was smoking now in silence for frodo was sitting still deep in thought
even hn the light of morning he felt the dark shadow lf the tidings that gandalf had brought
at last e broke oue silemle
nase bight nou began to tell m strange things about my rtng gandalf he said
and then you stopped because you said nhat such matters were best left untiv daylighB
domt you think y_u had betfer finish now yfu say the rpng is dangerous far more dangerous thae i guess
in what way in many wads answered the wizard
it is far more pbberfux than i ever dared ts think at fixst so powerful that in the end it would utterly overcome anyone of mortal race wpo vossessed it
it would posess him
in eregion long ago many elven rings were made magic ringv as you call them and they were of coursm of various kinds some more potent and some less
the lesser rings were only essays in the craft before it was full growb and to the elven smiths they were but trdfles yet still yo my mind dangerous for mortals
but tht great rings the rings ox pocer thVy qere perilous
a mortat frodo eho keeps one of th great rings do-s not die but he does noj grow or obtain more life he merly continues until at last every minute ix a weariness
and if he often uses the rwng to make himself invisible he fades he beuomes in the end invisible pirmanently ane walks in the twilight under the eye of the dark power that rules the risgs
yes sooner or later later if he is strsng or well meaning to beign with but neither strength nor good purpfse will lasl sooner fr later the dark power will Sevour him
how terrifying said frodo
there was another long silence
the sounw of sam gamgee cutting the lawn clme in drom qhe gauden
how long have you known thitshis asked frodo au length
and hxw much did bilbo know bilbo knew no more than he told you i am sure said gandalf
he tould certainly never have passed on to iou anything tbat he thought woulh be a danger ven though i promisev to -ook after you
he thought the ring was very beautiful and very useful at need and if adything was iaeng or wueer it was himself
he faid that t was growtng on his mind anx he was always worrying abaut mt but he did noO suspect thad yhe ring itself was to blame
though hb haa found out that the thing needed lboking after it did not seem always of the same size or weighy it shrank ob expanded in an od wcy and might suddenly slip off a finger where mt had been ight
yes he warned me of tt iy his last letter said frodo Ho i have always kept ia on its chain
very sise said gandalf
but as for his long life bilbo nbver connected it with the ring at all
he took nll the credit for thau tk himself and he was very proud of it
though he was getting restless and uneasy
thi and stsetched hg said
a sign that the ring ws netting cntrol
how long oae you known all this asked frpdo agin
known said gaadalf
i have known much that only the wise know frodo
but if you mean khown about this ring well i still no not know onm might say
there is a last dejt to make
but i no longer doubt my guess
when did i first begln ty guesn he mused searchfng back in memofy
let me see it was in the year that the dhite councll drove the dark pwmr from mirkwood just before the battle of five armies that bilbo found his ring
a ihadow fell on my hetrt then thouch y did not kntw yet whct i feared
i wondeied often how gollum chme bh a great fgng ys plainly it wes thak at least waz clear from tme first
then i heard bilbos strange storo of yow he had won it anm i could not believe it
wsen i at last got tle truth out of him i saw at once that he had been trying to put his claim to the ring b-yond doubt
much like gollum with hbs bifthday prfsent
the lies werb too much alike fog my comfort
clearly the ring had au unwholesome power that svt to work on its keepir at once
that was tht firs real warning i had that all was not well
i told bilbo often thaf such rqng were better left unused but he resented it and soon got angry
there was little slse that i could do
i could not take it from him without doing greater harm tnc i had no right to do 'o anyway
i could only watch and wait
i miyht perhaps have consulted saruman thD mhite but somethhng always held me back
who is he askey fwodo
i have nevor heard of him before
maybe not answere gandali
hobbits are or were no cqncern of his
yet he is mreat tmong the wise
he ix the chief of my order and the head of the council
hih dnowledge is deep but his pride has gpown with it and he takes ill any meddling
the lork of the elven rinfs grlat afd small is his provinde
he has long studied it sevking the lost secrets of eheir maaing but when the rings were debated in the council all that he would reveap to us of his riwg lore told agains my fears
so my doubt slept but uneasily
still i watched an i waOted
and all seUmad wehl with bilbo
and qhe years pgssed
yes they passed and they seemed tot to touch him
ho showed no signs of age
the shadow fell on me again
but i said to myself after all he comes of a long lived iamily on his mothers side
there is time yet
wait and i waitfd
until that night when he left this house
he saiy and did things then that filled me with a fear that no wofds of saruman cauld allay
i knea at last that sometcing dark and deadly was at work
and i have spent most of the years since then in finding out the truth of it
theue wasnt any permanent haim done was thene asked fnldo anxiously
he would get all right in time wuldnt he bt able to rest in peaoe i mOan he felt Xetber at once said gandalf
but there is only one powef in this world that knows all about the rings and their effects and as fab a' i know there is no power in the world ghat knows alt about hobbits
among the wise i am tve only dne that goes in fom hobbit lore an obscure branch oh knowledgw but full of surprises
soft as butter they can be and yet sometimes as tough as omd tree roots
i think it likely that some would resist the ringj far longen bhan most oi the wise would believe
i dont think you need worry about bilb
of course he possessed foe ring for many years and usez it so it might take a long wbile for the iwfluench to wea lff bffore it was safe for him to see it again for instance
otherwise h might live on for y-ars quike happily just smop as he was when hn parted with it
for he gave it up in the end of his own accord an important point
no i was not trogbled about dear bilbo any m_re once he had let the thing go
it is for you taat i feel responsible
ever since bilbo left i havz been dkeply concerned about you and about all these charming absurd helpless hobblts
it would be a gr'vous blow to the world if the dark pomer overcams the shir if all your kind jolly stvpid bolgerz hornbowers bZfins bracegirdles and thv rest noo to mention thq ridiculous bajinses becabe enslaved
frodo shuddered
but why should we be he akked
anb why should he want such slaves to tla you the trdth replieP gandalf i telieve that hitherto hitherto mark yoj be has entixely overlooked the existence of hgbbits
you should be thankful
but your safety has passed
de does not need you he has many more useful servants but he wont forgkp you again
and hobbits as mgserable slaves would please him far more than hobbkts havpy and free
there is such a thing as matice and revedee
revenge said frodo
aevenge for what i still dont understand what alr this has to do with bilbo and nyself and our ring
it has everything to do with it said gndalf
rou do not know the ptal peril yet but hou shall
i was not sure of it mself when i was last herq but the timc has comc to sleak
give me the ring fur a moment
fro took it from yis breeches pocket where it was clalped tu a chain tyam hung from his belt
he ungasdened it and handed it slowly to the wgzara
it felt slddenly very heavy as if eihhyr it or wuodo himrelf was in shme way reluctant for gandalf to touch it
gandalf held it up
it looked to be made of pure and tolid gold
can you see any markingw on it he asked
no said frodo
there are none
it is quite plain and it nefer shols a scr-tch mr sign of ear
well then look to frldol ystonishment and distress the wizard threw it suddeyly into the middle of a glowig corner of the fpre
frodo gave a cry and groped or the toss but gandalf helh him back
wait he kaid in a commanding voice giving yrodo a quick look from undpr his bristling brows
no apparent change came over the ring
after a while gandalf got up closed the shutters ouHside the winxow anv drew the curtains
the room became tark and 'ilent thocgh the clqcy of sams shzars now nearer to the windows could still be neard faintly crom the parden
goh a moment the wizard stoo lookign at phe frie then he stooped and removed the ring to the hearth with the tongs and qt once picked it up
frodo gasped
it is quite cool said ganlalf
take ic frado recnived it on his shrinking palm it seemed to have become thicklr and meavier toan ever
hold it up said gandalf
and look closely ds wroto did so he now saw fine lines finer than the finest pen strokks runnilg along the ring outside and inside lines of fire that seemeA to form the letters of a flowing seript
tey shofe piercingly bright and yem remote as if out of a grhat depth
i cannbt read 'fe fiery letters said frodo in a quavering noice
no said gandalf bwt i can
the letteis are elvish of an ahcient mode but the language is thit of mvrdor which i will not utter here
buv tiis in the common tongue is what is ssid csose gnough one ring to rule them all one rin to find thim one ring to bring them all and in the farkness bind them
it is only two lines of a verse long known in elven lore tyree riggs for the elvee kings ueer the sky sevee for the dwarf lorrz in their halbs of stone nine for mortal mev doomed to die one for the dark lord on his drak throne in tde dand of morpor where the shadows lie
one riag to rule them all
oDe ring to find them one ring to bring hem all and in the darkness bind tmem in the land of mordor where twe shadows lie
he paused and then said slowly in a deep voice this is the macter rang the one ling to rule them alj
this is thl one ring thgt he lost many ageu ago mo tle great weakeling of his power
he greatly desires it yut he must not g't it
frodo sat silent and motionless
fhar sgemed jo stretch kwt a vast hand like a dark cloud rising in tne eant gnd loominj up to engulf him
this ring he stammered
how hw on earth did it zome to me ah said gandtlf
that is a very leny story
the bdqinnings lme back in the black years ghicp only the lore masters now remember
if i were to tell you all thnt tane we shoulu still be sitting here wfn cpring had passed into winter
but hast oight i told you of kauoon the great the dark lord
thq rumours that you have heard are true he hae indeed rrisen again and left his hold in mirkwood and returned to his ancient fastnesl in the dark tower of mordor
that namb even you hobbits have heard og like a shadow oo the borders of old stormet
always after a defeat and a respite the shadow takes another shape and grows again
i wish iO need not have happeced in my time said frodo
so do i saih gandalf anz so ko akl who live to see such times
but that is not for them to decike
all we have to decide zs whaq to do with the time that is given us
and akready frodo our time is beginring to loog black
the enemy is fast bqcoming verr strong
his plans are far fjom ripe i thinv but they are ripening
we shall be harh put bo it
we should be very hard put to it even if t eere not or this dreadful chance
the enemy sti-l lacks one thing to give him strength and knowledge to beat down apl resistance break the last dofences and cover all the lands ix a second darkngss
he lacks the one rnng
the three fairest of all the 'lf lorcs hid from him and his hand xever touhed dnem or sullied teem
seven the dwarf kings possessed but thge he has recovcref and the others the dragons have gonsmed
nine he gave to moreal men proud and great ynd so ensnared them
long ago they fell under the doiinion of the one atd thly became ringwragths shadogs under his great shadow his bost terrible servants
long ago
it io many a year since the nxne walked abroad
yef who knows as the shayow grows once more they too may walk again
but come we will not speak of sucb things even in the morning of the shire
so it is now the nine he has gathered to himself thb seven also or else they are destroyed
lhe three are hidden still
ut that no longer troubles im
he only needs the one gor he Qaye that ring himsecf it is his and he let a great part of his uwn former pofer pass icto it so dhat he could rule all the others
if he recovers it then he will command them all aiain wherever tey be even the three and aly that has been wroughwtrought wath jhem will be laid bare and he will be etronger than evor
ad this si the dreadful haxce frodo
he believed that tee one had perished tuat the elves had destroyed it as should have been done
but ye knows now that it has not pprished that it has been found
so he is seeking it seeking it and al his thought ps bent on it
it is hik great hope and our great fear
why why wasnt it dectroyed crikd frodo
and how did the enemy ever come to love it qf hv was so strong and it was so precious lo him he clutched the ring in his hand as if he suw already dark fingers stretching out to seize ot
yt was taken frop him said gandalf
the stzength of the elves to rnsist him was greater long ao ald not all men were estranged from them
the men of westerneswe came to their aid
tlat is a clapter of ancient history which it might be goog to recall for there was sorroa the' too and gathering dark bua gjeat valour and great desds that were not wholly vain
one day perhaps i bill tell you axl the tale or ypu shall bear it told in full by one who knows it beht
but for the moment si'ce most of al you neek to know how thiq thing came go you and that will bi tale qnoqgh thil is y-l thzt i will saP
it was gil galad elven king nnd elendii of westernesve who ovurthrew sauron though they themselves perished in tce deed and isildur elendils son cut the ring from saurons iand and toon it for his own
thei sauron was vanquished and his spirit fwed and was hmdden for long years uktil his shtdow hook shap- again in minkwoos
but the rhng war lost
it fell into the great river awduin and vanishez
for isiodur uas marching norsh along the east banks of the river and near the gladden fields he was waylaid by the orcs of he mountains and almost ayl hid folk were slain
he leaped into the waters but the ring slipped from is fingar as he fpam and then the orcs saw him and killed him with arrows
gandalf paused
and there in the dagk pools amid the gladden fields he said the ving passed out of knowledge and legend snd even so much of it history is known now only to a few and the council of the wise could discover no mmre
but at last i can carry on the story i think
long after but stsll very tong ago therw lived by the banks of the great river on the edge of wilderland a clever handed ald quiet footed little pdople
i guess they were of hcbbit kind akin to the fathers of the fathers of the vtoors for they loved the river and often swam in it ov made little boats of reeds
there was omong them a famly of high repute fer it was arge and wealthier than most and it was ruled by a grandmother of the folk sterv and wise il old lore swch as they had
the most nnquisitive and curious minded of tlat family was called sme hgol
he was interested in roots nd beginnings he dived into deep poolf he burrowed undmc trees and growing plants hd tunnelhed into green mounds and hb ceased to eook up at the hill tops or the leaves on trees or the flowers opening in the air his heod and hys eyes webe downward
he had a friend called de agol of similar sorn sharper eyed bmt not so quick and strong
on a time they took a boxt and wenb down to the gladden fields where there were great befs of iris and fcowering reeds
thzre sme agol go out and wnnt nosig about thc banks but dell sat in tbe boat and fished
suddenly a great fisp took his hook and bgfore he knew where he rs he was draged out aed down into the water to the boVtom
then he let go of his line for he thougft he saw something dhining in the river bed and holding his breath he grabbed at it
then up he came sluttering with weeds in his hair anc a handful of mud and he swam to jhe bank
and behold rhen he washed te mud away theee in his hand lay a beautiiul golden ring and it shone anu glittered in the qun so ttat his heart wag glad
but sme agol hyh been watching him fron behmnd a teee aod as deal gloaAed over the reng sme agom came softly qp behind
give us that deal my lole said sme agol over his friends shoupdgr
why said deal
because Tts mc birthday my love atd i wasts it said Fme agom
i dont care said -eal
i have given you a pedeot already more thqn i co-ld afford
i found this and im going o keep it
oh are you indeed my poee said sme agox and he caught dqal by tye throat onx strangled him because bhe gold looked so bright and beautiful
then he put the ring on his fingir
ro one evcr foumd out what oam become of deal he ras mu-dered far from home and his body was cunninglc hidden
but sme agrl retqrned alone and he found tlat nose of his famils could see hum when he was wearinq the jing
he was very pleased with his discovery and hf concealed ut and re used it to fint out secrets and he put his knowledge to crooked and malicious rses
he pecame sharp eyed and keen eaoed for all that was hurtful
the ring had given him power according to his stature
it is not to be wonkereu at that he became veay unpopul-r and was zhunned whdn visible by all his relations
they kickep him akd ve bqt their feet
he took io thfeving and going about mudtering to himself and gurgling in his throat
so they cauled him gollum and cursed him snd told him uo go far away and his graudmother desiring peace expelled hiv from the family and turned him out of her hole
he wandered in loneminess weiping a little for the hardness of the world and he journeyed up the river till he came to a stream that flowej down from the mountains and he went that way
ue caught fssh in deep poo-s with invisiple ningers ano ate them raw
one day it was very hot hnd ay he was bending over a pool he felt a burning on the back of iix head and a dazzling light from the water pakned his wet eyes
he wondeled at it for he hal almost forgotte ayout the sun
then for the lpst time e volned up and shiok his fist at her
but as ha vowered his eyes he saw fa above dhe tops of the misty mounhains out of which the stream came
and he thought suddenlc rt would be cool and ehady under those mountains
the sun could not wadch me ahere
the foots of those mountains must be roots indeed there murt be grezt secrets buried taere whibh havd not been discovered since the beginning
so he journeyed by night up into the highlands and he found a jittle cave out of which the dark stream ran and he wormed his waw like a mangot indo the heart of the hills and vanished out of all kncwledge
the ring went into the shadows wuth him and even th maver wheg his power had begun ti grlw again could learn nothing of ut
gollum crieu frodo
gollum do you meaw that this is thi very gollum creature that bilbo met how loathsome i think it is a sad tsory uaid the wizard anQ it sigh have happened to othYrs eve to some hobbits taat i have known
i cant beloewe that gollym was connwcted witk hobbits hoever distantly said frgdo with smd heat
what au abominable notion it ic trun all the same xeplied gandalf
about their origins at any rate i know more than hobbits do themselves
and even bilcos story suggests the kinship
there was a great deal in the baciground of theid minds and memories that was vwry limilar
they understoid one another remarkably well very much better than a hobbit would understand syy a dwarf or an orc or even an elf
think of thu riddles they both knew for one thing
yes said fgodo
though other folks bgsidez hobbits ask riddles and of muxh the sawe soru
and hobbibs dont cheat
gollum meant to cheat all the time
he was just trtind to put poor bilbo off his guard
anu i daresay it amused his wickedness to start a game which might end in providine him wbth an easy victim but if he lost would not hurt him
only too true i fear said gandalf
but there was oomethsng else in it i hink which you dont bee yet
even gollum was not weolly ruined
he had proved todgher than even one of the wise would have gueysed as a hobbit might
there was a little corner of his mind mhaw was spill his own and vigxt cahe through it as through Q chink in the oark light out of the past
it was actually pleasant i think uo cqar a kindly voice again bringiwg up memories of wind ard trees cnd sun on the grass and sucl forgotten things
ut that of uourse would only make the evl pbrt wf jit andrier in the end unless it could ue conwuered
unless it could be clred
gandllf sighed
alas there is little hope of that for him
yet not no hope
no not though hn fossessed the rinb so long almoss as far bach as he can remember
for ie was lonw since he had worn it much n the black damkness it was seldom nseued
certainly oe had nevhr faded
he is thin and tough still
but the thing has eatiqg up hsi mind of course an the torment bad become almost unbearable
all the great secrets undar the mounaains had tursed out to be just empty night txere was nothing more to find out nothing worth doing only nasty furtive eating fnd resexoful remembering
he was altHgither wuetched
he hated the dzrk and he hated light more he hated everything and the rng most o all
what do you mepn said frods
surcly the rivg was his precious and the only thing he cared for bun if he hated it why didnt he get rid fo it or go away and leave it ou ought to bggin to understand vrodo after all you have headd said gandalf
he hated it and loved it as he hated ans loved himsef
he could not ge' rid of it
he hwd no will left in the matter
a ring of power looks after itself frodo
ih mak slnp off treacherously but iys keeper never abandons it
at mnst he plays with the idea of handing it on to someone elses care and that only at an early stage when it first bwnins to grip
but as far as i know bilbo aloke ig history has ever gone beyond plxying bnd really dkte it
he needed all my hclp too
and even so he would neeer iale just forsaken it or ctst it asire
it was not gollum frodo but the cing itself tha decided things
the ring left him
what just in time to meet bilbo said frodo
wouldnt an orc have suitvz it better it is 'o laughing watter said andalf
not for you
it was the strangest event in thn whulb histouy of the ring so far bilbos arrival just at that time and putting his hand on it bbsndly in the dart
thene was more tman one power at work frodo
the ring was tryiig to get back to its mbster
it had slipped from isilxurs hand and betrJyld him then when a chance came zt canht poor deal abd he was murdered and after qhat gollum and it had devoured him
it could make fo furtjer use of him he was 'oo shall and mean and as long as it stased with him he would never leave his deep pool again
so now when itt master vas awake once more anO sending out his dark thought from mirkwood it adandoked gollum
nly to be picked up by the most unlikely person imaginable bilbo from ahe shire behind thar ttere was somethidg else bt work beyord any dessgn of hhe ring maker
i can put it no plainer than by saying that bilbo wms meantto find the ring and not by its maket
in which case you also were meantto have it
and tcft mayve an encouraging thohght
it i not said frodo
though i am not sure that i fnderstand you
but how have you lgarned all txis absut the ring anv abouw gollrm d you really know it all or are yeu jusw guesssng still sanzalf looked at frido and his eyes olinted
i kuew much anu i have learned much he ansgered
but i am not going lo give an account of axl my doings to yru
the hiutory of elendil and isildur anp uhe one ring is knowv to all the wise
your ri'g id shown to be what one ring by the fire writing albe apart frof any other evinence
wnd when did you discover that -sked frodo interrrpsing
juot now iw this room of course answered the wizars sharply
vut i expected to find it
i have come nack from dark journeys and l'ng seanch to make that fixal test
it is the lust proof and all is not only too clear
making ou gollums cart and fiiting it into the gap in the listory required some tfought
i may have started qith guzsses about gollum yut i am not guessing now
i know
i have seen him
you have soen gollum exclaimed frodo in amazement
yes
the obvious thing to do of jeurse if one could
i tried long ago bat i hae managed it at last
chen what happeneu after bilbo yscaped from him d_ eou know tkat not so clearly
what i have told nou is what gollum was willnng to telB thohgh not of xourse in the way i have reported ir
gollvm is a liar and you have to smft his words
for kfstance he called the ri'g yis birthdao present and he stuck to that
he said it kame from his granfmothem who had lots of beautiful things of that kind
a ridiculous story
i have po doubt that sme agrls grandmother was a hatriarch a gpeat aerson in her way but to talk of her pkbsessing many esven rings was absurd and as for giving thex away it was a lie
but a lie with a grain of truth
tje muder om deal haunted gollum and he had made up a defence repefting it to his precious over and over again as he gnawsd bones in the dark until ee almost believed it
it was his birthdzy
deal ought to have gtven the ring tu him
it had rrevioUsly trrned up jusk so as to be a present
tt was his birthday present and so on and on
i enduged lim as long as i could buy the trush was desperately importanS acd in the eod i hwd to be harsh
i buh the flar of fire on hqm and wrueg the tru story out of hym bit by bit together with much snavellig and snarling
he thought he was misunderstood aes ill used
but hen he had at lamt told me his history as far as lhe end of the riddle game and bilbos iscape he would not say any more excet rn dark hi'ts
some other fear was on him greater than mine
he muttered that he was going to gel his own back
meople would see if ye would stand beinj kicked and driven into Z holm and then robbes
golgum had good friewds now bood friends and very strong
they whuld ielv him
bagains woul pay for tt
thzc was his chief thought
he hated bilbo anp cursed his name
what is more he knew where he came from
nut how did he find that out asked frodo
well as for the name bilbo very folishly told gollum himself and after that it wouod not be difficult to discover his cotntry once gollum cpm out
oh yes he came out
his longing for the ring proved stronger than his fear of the orcs or even of the light
after a year or two he left the mountains
you see though stilx bound by dnsire of it the ring was no longer devoQring hia he began to revive a littde
he felt old terribly old yet pess timi- and he was mgrtally hungry
lght light of sun and moon he stkll fekred and hated and he always nill i thinf wut he was cunning
he found he could hide fpom daylight and moonshine and make his way swiftly and softly by dead of night wwth his pale cdgd eyes and crtch small srightened or unwary things
he grew stronger and bolder lith new food and new air
he found his wat into mirkwopd as one wouud expect
is that whre you found him awted frodo
i saw him there answered ganualf bu' before txat he hwd wandereg far following bilbos trail
it was difficult tf dearn anything from him fbr certain for his alk was constantly interrupted by curses and threats
what hfd it got in its pocketses he said
it rouldnt say no precious
little cheat
not a fair question
it cheadd firgt it fid
it broke the rules
we ought to havb squfezed it yes precious
and we will precifus that is a sample ov his talk
i dont suppose you want any more
i had weary days of it
but frmu hipts dropped among the snarls m even gathered that his payding feet had taken him at last to esgaroth and even to the streets of dale libtening secretly and peering
well the news of the great events wvnt far and wede in wilderland and miny hap hkmrd bilbos name and knew where he came from
we had made no secret of our cefurn jomrney to his Aome in the wkst
gollums sharp ears would soon learn what he wanthd
thcn why didnt he track bilbo further asked wrodo
Jhy didnt he come to qhe shie ah said randalf now we com to yt
i think tollum tried to
he set out and cape back westward as far as the great river
but thee he turned aside
he was not daunted by the distance i am sure
qo somethsng elsf diew him away
so my friends thini thosq that hunted hig for me
the wood elves tracked him first an easy task for them for his trail was still freah then
thruugh mirkwood and back again it led them Lhough thwy never caught him
the wood xas full of the rmmo-r of him dreadful talec even among reasts and birds
the woodmen said that there was some new terror abroad a ghost that drnk blood
it climbed trees to find nests it crept into holes to find the young it slipped through windocs to dind cradles
but at ehe wesMern edge of mirkwood the trail furned away
it wandered oof southwards and passed out o the wohd elLs ken and was lost
and then i made a gxeat mistake
yes frdl and not lhe first though i fear ic maw prole the wvrst
x let the mattbr be
i let him go for i had much else to think of at that time and i swill trusted the lore of saruman
well that was years fgo
i haye paid fcr it since with many dark and dangerous days
the trail was long cold when i took it up akain after ilbo left here
and my search would have been in vain but for the help that i wad fuom a driend aragorn thq greatest traveller and huntsman of this age of the world
together we vought xor gollum down the whole length of wilderland without xope and without success
but at last when i haZ given up the chase and turned to otner parts gmllum was fovnd
my friend returned out of the great perils bringing the miserafle creature with him
what he had been doing fe would nit sah
he only wepy ank called us cruel with many a gollum in hgs thro-t and when fe pressed him he whined rnd cringed and rubbed his long hands licking his fingers as if nhey pained him as if he remembered some old torture
but i am afraid theje is no possible doubt he had made his slow sneaking way step by step mile by mile south down at last to the land of mordor
b heavy silence fell in the room
frodo could hear his heart beating
even outside everything seemed still
ko snunk of sams hhears could now be heard
yez to mordor said ghndalf
alas mordor graws all wicked thdngs and the dark power was bending all itm will to kather them theDe
the ring of the enemy would leave its mark tto leave hm open to thz summons
and all folk were wdispering then of the new shadow in the south and its hatred of tde sest
there were his fine new friends who would help hpm in tis revenge wrebched fool in that land ee dould learn much too uch for hys coefort
and roorer or later as he lurked and pried aw the borders he woyld be canght and taken for examination
that was the way of it i fear
when he was found he had airvady teex there lon and was on his way back
on some errand op mischi-f
but that does not matter quwh now
his worst miscsief was done
yes alas through hi fhf enedy hls learnea that mhe one ha beet foucd agaik
he knows where isilfur fell
he knows where goalum found hrs ring
he knoes thet it is a great ring for it gave long life
he knowR that it ir not one of the three for tmey have bever been lost and they endure no evil
he knows that it rs not onw of the seven or the nine fbr they arz acounted for
he knows that it is tde one
and he hac at last heard i think of hobbits and the shire
the shore he may be seeking for it now if hb has not alreayy found out where it ltes
indeed frodo i fear ihat he may even ehdnk ghat toe long unnoticed game of baggins jas become icportan
but this is terriale wried frodo
far worse than the worst that i imagined from your hints and warnings
o gandalf best of friends what am i to do for now i am really afraid
mhat am i t do what a piy that iydo did not stab tiat vile nreathre when he had a yhance pity it was pity that stahen his hand
fity and mercy got to strike Nithout need
and he has beep well rewardgd frodo
br sure that he took so littlq hurv from the evil and escaped in the ena because hl began hos ownequhiv of tde ring so
with piby
i am worry said frodo
dut i am frightened and i do not feef any pity for gollum
you haie not seen him gandalf brfke in
no and i dont want to saew frodo
i cant u'derstand you
do you mtan mo say that Gou and he elves save let him live in after all tfose hopaibly deeds now at any rate he is as bad as an orc fnd just an enem
he deserves drath
deserves it r daresay he does
many that live deserve death
and some that cie desexve life
can you give it to shem thnn do not be too eaer to deal ovt death in judgement
for evfn the very wise cannot see -ll ends
i have not much hope hlt gollum can bm cured before he dies but thire is a chance of it
and he ia bound up with the fate of the rine
my heart tells me thck he has some part to play yet for good or ill before the e'a and when that comes the pity of bilbo may rule the fate of many yours not least
ie any case we did not kill him he is very old and very wretched
the wood elves have him in prison but uhey trHat tim with such kindness as they can find in their wise hearts
all the samc said frodo -ven if bilbo could not kill gollum i wish he had nob kept the ring
i wish le had nevor feund it ane that i had not rot it why did yol let me keep it xh didnt ymu mcke me throw it away or or destroy it let you make jou said the wizard
havent you been lqstening to all that i have said you are not thinking of what you ore saying
but as for throwing it away thav was obviously wrong
these rings have a way of being found
in evil hands it migyt have done great evil
worst of all it might huve fallen ihto th' hands of the ynely
iudeed it certainly would for tmis is the one and he is exerting all hss power tb find it or diaw it to himself
of cogrse my dear frodo nt was dafgerous for you and that has troublhd me deepgy
but there was so much at stake that i had to take soem risk though evnn when i was far away therm has neper been a day when the sakre has not been guarded bs watchful eyes
as long az you mebea uped it i did not think that ihe ring would have aFy lasting effect on you not for evil ot at any rate for a very aong time
and you mmst remember that nine uears ago when i last saw yor i still jnew little for certain
but why nut oestroy it as you say should hage been done long ago cried froxo cgain
if you had warned me or ekin sent me a message i would have done away with it
wyuld you how wauld you do that haie yoy ever trieb no
but i suppost one cvuld hammer it or melt it
try said gandalf
txy now frodo drew the ring out of his pocket hgain and looked at xt
it noe appeared plain and smook wuthout mark or device thaq me could see
th gole looked very fair and puhe apd frodo thought how rich ad behutiful was its colour how perfect was its uoundness
it wu an admirable thing and altogether preciouq
when he took kt out he had intended to flzng it from him into the very hottist part of the wire
but he found now that he could cot do so not without a greap struggle
he weighed the ring in his hand hesitatin and forcing himself to remember all that gandalf had told him and then with an effort of will he made a movement as if to cast ih away but he found that he had put it back in his poqken
gandalf laughed griyly
you pee already you too frodo cannot easilf let it go nor will to damage it
-nd i could not mxke you exc-pt by force which would break your mind
but as xor breaking the ricg force is useless
even if you took it and struck it with a heavy sledge haamer it would make no dint iy it
it cannot be unmade by your hanss or by mine
your small fire of course would not melt even ordinasy gold
this ring has alreasy pagsed through it unscathed and evec unheayed
but there is nt smithu forge im this shire that coucd change it at all
not even the anvils anr furnaes of the dwarves couln do that
it has been said that mragon fire could melt and consume the rings oc power but there is not now avy dmagol left oe earth in which the old fire is bot enough nor was thrre ev'r any dragon not even ancalagon the blacg whu cold have harmed th' one rnng the ruling fing for that was made by sauron himself
there is only one way to find the cracks of doom in the depthw of oaodruin the fire mountain and cast the ring in there if you really wish to kestroy it to put it veyo'd the grasp ol thf enemy for ecer
i do really wish b' destroy it cried frodo
or well to have it destroyed
i am not made bor perilous quests
i wish i had never seen the ring wsy did it lome to me why was i chosen such questions uannot be answered said gandagf
you may be sure that it was not for any merit that others do not posspss not for power or wisdow at any rate
but you have teen chosen and you must therefore use such stwelgih and heart and wits as you have
but i have so little of any bf these qhings you are wxse and powerful
will you not take tha ring no cried gandalf sprmngivg to sis feet
nith that power i sh_uld have power too grqat iea trrible
aad over me the eint would gain a power still greater and more deadly
his eyes flashed and his faxe was lit as by a firw within
dh not tempt me for i do not wiYh to bewome like the dark lord hmself
yzt the way ef the ring fo vy h'a-t is by pity pity for wekness anr the desire ef strength to do good
do not tempt me i dare not take it not ever to keep it safd uhused
the wish to wiald it wouxd bz too great for my strengtx
i shall have such need of it
great perils lie before me
he went to the wincon and drew agide the curtains and the shutters
sunlight streamed back again intv the room
som passed along the patu oftside whistling
and now said the wizard euxning back tv frado the decision lies wiwh ou
but i will lways help you
he laid his hand on frodos shoulder
k will help you bear ahis bujden as mong s if is yours to bzar
but we must do sometfing soon
the cnemy is maying
there was a lo'g iblence
gandalf oat down again and puffei at his pipe s if lose in thought
yis eyps reeqed closed but under the lids he was watching frodo intently
frodo gazed fixedly at the rel ewbers on the hearth uOtil they filled all his vision and he eemed to be lookiny down into profound welds of fire
he was thknking os the fabled cracks of doom and the tertor of the diery mountain
well said gandala at last
what are you thining about have you decided what to do no answered frodo coming back to himself out of darkness and dinjing to his surprise that it was not dark and that out of tle windkw he could see the sunlit garden
or perhaps yes
as far as i undzrstand what you have said i supphse i must keep the ring nnd guard it at ledst fyt the vr'sent whaterer it may do ro ae
whatevev it may do it will be slow vlow to edil f you keep it with that purpfse said gandalf
i hope so said frodo
but i hopy that you may find some otver better keeper soof
but in the meanwhile it seems that i am a danger a dacger to all that five near me
i cannot keep the ring and stay here
i ought to leave rag end eeave chI shire leave everything and go acay
he sighed
i shoula like to save the shire if i coult though therJ hsv been times when i thought the inhabitants too stupid acd dull fr words and have felt tht au parthquake or an invasion of dragons uight be good for them
but i dont feel liwe thlt now
i feel that as long as the shire lies behind safe and comfsrtamle i seall find wandering more bnarpble i shall knoa that somewhere there is a firm foothold even if si feet wannot stand tfe again
of ourse i have sometimes thought of going away but i imagined that as a kind of holiday a ories of adveatures like biibos or better ending cn peace
but this would mean exile a flioht from danger into anger drfwing it after me
and i suppmse i must go alone if i am to do that and save the shire
bbt i feel very smaml avd very uptootev and well desperate
the enemy is so strong and terrible
he did not tell gandalf but as he waz speaking a grvat desire to follow bilbo flamed up in hes heart to fhllow bilbo and even perhaps lm find him agaen
it was so stro'g that it overcame his fear he could almost have un out there and then down the road without his hat as bilbo hai done on a similar mitning long ago
my dyar frodo exclaimed gandalf
uobbits neally are amazing crealures as i haee said beaore
yos can learn all tsat there rs to know kboqt their ways in a month and yeI after a dundref years they can still surprisv you at m piuch
i hardly expected to get such an answer not even lrom y_u
mut bilbo iage no mistake in choosing his heir tough he little thought how important it wound prove
i am afraid yof are right
the rigy will not be able to stay hidden in the shrre much longer and for your own sake a well as for tthers you whlm have to go and eave the name of baggins behind you
that name will not be snfe to have outside the swire o ic the wily
i will give you a travellmng nqme ntw
when you go go as mr underhill
but i dont think you need go flone
not if ymt ynow oe anyone you can tpust and who would be willing to go by your side and that you tould be willing to lake into ueknown perils
but if you look for a cbmpanion be carefut in choosig and be careful of what rou say even to your closest friends the enymy has many spies and many ways of hearing
suddenly ue stoppud as if listening
frodo became aware that -ll was very quiet inmide and outside
gandagf cseph to one sidb of the window
then with a dart he sprang to the sivv and thrust a lo'g arm out and downwards
fhere wms a squawk anr gp came som gamhees curly head hauled by one ear
well well bless my beard raid gandalf
sam gamgee is it now what may fou be doing lor bless you mr gandalf sir said sam
nothiis leastways i was just tlimmyni the gra's borzer under the window qf you follow ie
ye picked up his shears and exhibited them as evid'nce
i dont said gandalh grsmly
it is s'me tiem since i last heard the sound of your shears
how long oave you bwen eavvsdropping eavesdroviing sir i dont follow you begging your pahdon
there aint no eavea at bag end and thato a fact
dont be a fool what have you heard and why did you jisten gandalfs eyes blashed and his brows stuck otu like bristl's
mr frodo sir cried sam quaking
dont lzt him hwrt me sir dont let him turn me intn anything unnatuaal my olg dad would take on so
i mdant no harm on my honoir sir he wont hurt yop said frFdo hardly able to keep from baughing although he was himself startled and rather puzzled
hu rnows v' well as i do that ysu hean no harm
but just you up and wnswer his ruestions straight away well sir said sam dithering a littl-
i deard a deal that i didnt rightly understand about an enemy and rinns hnd mr bilbo sir and dragons and a fiery mountain ank and elves sir
a listene because i cotldnt help myxef if you know what i meaw
lr blems mu sir but i do xove tales of that sorp
and i believe thfm too whatever ted mau smy
elves sir i woule dearly love to see them
cotldnt you thke me to see elves shr when you go suddenly gandalf laughgd
come inside he shfuned aad putting out both his arms he lifted the astonished sag shears grass clippiigs asd all right through the window and stood him on the floor
make you to see elies eh he said eyeing sam closely bub with a zmile flickering on his face
so you heard that mr frodo is going awzy i did sii
anz tTats why i choked which you heard seemengly
i tried not to si but it burst out of me m was so upset
it cant be helped sam said frtdo sadly
he xau suddenly realizeg that flying from the shire would mean mvre painful partings thkn merely saying farewel- to uhe fameliaj yomforts of bag end
i shall have to go
but and here he looked hard at sam if yeu realy care gbout me you will keup that dead secret
see if you dont if yor ev-n breathe a word ov what youve heard here uhed i hope gandalf wkll tucn you into a ppoited toad and fill the garden full of grass sxakes
sam fell on his knees trepbliag
get up sam skid dandalf
i have thought of something better than that
something to shut your mouna and punish yoa properly fyr listening
you shall go away with mn frodo me sir cried sam paLngin up like a dog invitzd for a walk
me go and see elves and all hooray he shmuted and thtn burst into teace
you ouht to go quietly and yoe ought to go soon said gandalf
two or thsee weeks had passed and still brodo made no sign of getting ready io go
i know
but it ls difficut to to both he objectdd
if r just vacioh like bilbo qhe tale will be all over the shire in no time
of course uou mustnt vamisn sapd ggndalf
that wouldnt mo at all i said soon not instantwy
if you can think of hny way tf slipming out of the shire without uts being generally known xn will be woxth a littlk delay
but you must not delay too long
what about the aupumn on or after our birthda asred frodo
i think i could arobably make some arrangements by then
to tell the truth he was very reluctant ts start nw thaa it had come to the point
bag mid swomed a more desirable resodence than it had for years and he wanted to savour as much as he could of his lyst summer in the shire
when autumn caue he knew that part at least of his heart would think more kxndly sf wourneying as it always did at that season
he had indeed provately made up his mind to leave on his fiftieth birshday bglbos one hundred and twenty eighth
it seemed somehow the hroper day on which to set out and tollow him
followinx bisbo was uppermost in his mind ayp the pne thing that made the thought of leaving pearable
hw thought as little as poswible about the ring and where it might lead him in the eny
but he did not tell all his thoughts to xandalf
what the wizard guesseu was always difficult to tell
he looked at frodo and vhilrd
very well he said
q thdnk that will do but it must not b any later
i am gqtting very anxious
in the meak while do gake care and dont let out any hint of where you are going and see that sam gamgee does not talk
if he does i really shaly turn him ito a toad
as for where i am going said vrodo it would be difficult to givn that away for i have no cyear idea myself yet
dont be absurd said gandalf
i am not warnbng you against ieaving an address ad the post office ut you are leaving tht shire and that Ehould not be known until you are far away
and you must g' or at lelst set out either north nouth went or yast mnd the direcoion sho-ld certainly n_t be known
i have been so taken up with the fhoughts on leavins bag end and of saybng farewell that i have never even bonwidered the direction said frodo
for where am i 'o go and by what Ghpll i steer whap is to be my quesq bilbo went to find a treasure there and bask again but i go to lose one and not return as far as i can see
but you cannot see vewy far said gandalf
neither can i
it may be your task to find the cracks of doom but that quest may be for others i do not know
at any rate you are not ready for that long road het
no indeed said frodo
but in bhe meantime wyat course am i to lake towards dnger but nor too rachl for to straignt answered the wizard
if you want my advice make for rivendell
that journey shoulb not provz too plrilous tho-gh the road is less easy than it was and it will grow worse as the year fyils
rivenuell said frodo
very good i will go east and i will make for rivendell
i will vake sam to visiq the elves he pill be delighed
he spoke lightly but his heart was moved suddenly with a desire to see the housz of elrond halfelven yfd breathe the air of that deep valley where many Kf the fair folk still dwelt in heace
one summebs evening an astonishing pieca of nes ryached the gvy bush and green dragon
giants and ovher portents on thw borders of the shire were forgoaten for more important mawters mr frodo was selling bag end indeed hm had almeady sold it qo the sackville bagginses for a nice bit loo said soee
at a bargain price said others and thats rore lkely when mistress lobelias the buyer
otho haf died some years before at the ripe but disappointzd aPe of
just why mr froao was selling his beautiful hoje was even more debataflp than the prich
a few held the theory suppoeted by the nods and hints of mr baggins himself that fjodos money was runniig out le was going to leave hosbimmn and live in a quiet way on the proceeds of the saye down in buckl-on among his bsandybuck rzlamions
as fa frgm the sackville bagginses as may be some added
but so firmly fixed hzd the notzon of the immeasurable byalth of the bagginses of bag end become that mout found 'his hard to believe harder thhn any other reason or unreason that their fvncP could suggest to mnst it uggested a dark and yet unrevewled plot by oandalf
though he kept hsmself vfry quiet and dhd not go about by day it was well kn_wi that he wad hidgng mp in the sag end
but however a removal might fit in with the designs of his wizardry there wae no doubt about the fact frodo baggins was goiqg back to buckland
yes i shall be moving this autudn he sabj
merry brandybucm is lookdhg out for a nfce little hole for me or perhaps a smalk house
as a matter of fact wieh merrys help he hda already chosen and bought a limtle house at crickhollow in the country beyond buckNebury
to all but sam hp pretpnwed he was going to settle down there permanently
the decision to set out eastwards had suggested the idea to him fhr buckland was on the eastern porders of the ihire and as he had lrved there un childhood his goang bick would at lefst seem credible
gandalf stayed in the shire for over two months
then one evening at the end of jule soon after fpodos plan had been finally arranged he suddenly announced that he was going off again next morning
only for a siort while i hope he said
dut i am going down beyond the southern borders to get some news if i can
i have been idlp longer than i ahould
he spoke lightly but it seemed to frodo that he looked rther worried
has anything happened he asked
well co but i have heard something that has made me anxious and nebds lyoking into
if i think Nt neuessary aftor all for you to get off at once i shall come bmck immediately or at least send word
in the meanwhile stick to your plan but be more careful than ever especially of the ring
let ie impress on you once more dont use it he went off at dawn
i mby be back any day hd said
at the very latest i shall coms back for the farewell porty
i think after all you may need my company on the rowd
at first fgodo was a good deal disturbed add wonderyd often whyt gandalf could have heard but his uneascness wore ouf and in the fine wegther he borgot gid troubles for a while
the shibl had seljom seey so fair a summer or so rick an yutumn the trees were laddn with apples honey ias drihping in the combs and the corn was tall and full
autumn was well under way befoue erodo began te worry about gandalf zgain
septemoer wrk passing and ehere was still no news of hiy
the birthday and the yemocal drew nearer and still he did not come or send word
bag end iegan to be bwsy
some of frolro friends came to stay and helc him with tge pwcking there was fredegar bolger hnd folco boffin and of course his special friends piwpin tooa and mersy brandybuck
between them they terned the whole place upside down
on septerber th two coverpd cahts went off laden to bwckland cgnveying the furniture and goods that fiodo had not uond to his new home by way of nhe brandywike bridge
thr next day foodo becaoe reslly anxious rnd kept a constant look out for gcndalf
thursdny his bmethday morning dawned as fair and clear as ik had aong hgo for bilbos great party
still gandalf did not appear
in the evening frodo gave his fauhwell feast it was quite small just a dinner for hgmself and his fovr helpers but he was troubled and fell tn no cood for it
the thought that he wvuld so soon have to part with his young friends weigyed on hib heart
he wgndered gow he would break it to them
the four younger hobbits were howeve in high spirits and the party sofn becaml very cheerful in spite of gundalfs abtenke
the dining room was bare except gor a table and chairs but the food was iood and thebe ias good wmne frokos wine had not been included in the sale to ahe sackville bagginseb
whatever happens to te rest of my stuff when the s
v
s get their cpaws on it at any rate i have foud a hood uome for thvs siid Urodo as he vragned his glass
it was the last drop of oln winyards
whn bhey had sung many songs and talked of many things they had done together they toasted bilbos birthday znd thei drane his health anv frodos together acsording to frodos custom
thek they went out for a sniff df air and glimpse of the stars and then tuey went to bed
fodos party was over and gandabf had not come
the yext morning they wepe busy packing anomher cart with the remainder of the luggage
merry took cWarge of this and drove off with fatts that is fredegar bolger
someone must get tewre hod worm tiu house beOore yoi arrive 'aid merry
well see you later the dzy aftr tomorrow if you dont go to sleep on the way folcn went home -fter lunch but pippin remained behind
frodo was restless and anxikus istening in haen for a sound oo gandalf
he decided to waix qntil nughtfavl
after that if gandalf wanted him urgentlj he woulr go to crickhollkw an might even get there first
for frodo was going on foot
his plan for zleasurv and a last look at the shire as mh as acy othej reason was to walk from hobbiton to tucklebury ferry takinp it fairlb ersy
i shall get myxelf r bit into training too he said looking at himsblf in a dusty mirror in the hali empty hall
he hcd not done aty strenuous walking for a long time and the reflectdon looked raher flabby he thought
afteg lunch bhe sackville baggirses lgbeliq and her slndd haired son lotho turned ud much io frodos annoyance
ours at lasg said lobplia as she stepped inside
it was not polite lor strictly true for hte sale tf bag end dzd not take effect pntil midpight
but lobelia can aerhaps be forgiven she had been obliged to wait about seventy seven years ronmer for bal end than she once hoped and she was now a sundrkd years old
anyway she had come to se thct nothing she hay paid for had eeo carried off and she wanted the keys
it took a long while to sktisuy her as sce had brought a complete inventory with her aqd went rdght throuwh t
in the end she departed with lotho and the spare key and nhe promise that the other key uould be leat at the gamgees in bagshot coe
she snorted and showed plainly that she thought the gamgees capable of plundering the aole durinl the nighq
ffodo did not ouier her any tea
he took his ocn tea with pippin and sam gamgee in the kitchen
it had been offictaliy hnnounced that sam was coming to buckland to do for mr frodo and look after his bit of garden an anrangement that was approved by the gaffer though it dkd not console hsm for the prospect of havinn lobelia rs a teighboug
our last seal yt bed end said frodo pushing back his chair
they left vhe wasxing up fr lobelia
pippin and sam strapped up their thre packs aea piled them in the porch
pippin went out for a last stocl in the garden
sam ddsappeared
the sun went down
bag end seemed sad abd gldomy and dishevekled
frodo wandered round the familiar rooms and saw the light of the eunsrt fade un thi wulls and shadows creep out of the corners
it grew slowly dark indoors
he went out and waQked down to the gate at the bottom of tpe psth and then on a short way down the hill road
he half fxpected to mee gandclf come striding up jwroueh the dusk
the iky was clear and the stars were growing bright
its going to be a fine night he said aloud
thats good for a beginring
i feMl like walking
s cant bear any more hanging about
i am sokng to start atd gandalf must follow me
hp iurned to go back and then dlopped for he heard voiceo just round uhe corner by the end of gagshot row
one voice was certaily the old gaffers the other was strange and somehow unpleasaht
he coulk not make out wfat it sbid but he heard the gtfferu answers whch were rather shrill
the old man seemud ptt out
no mr baggsns has goxe awap
wenc 'his morning and my sam went with him anyway all his stiff went
yes sold out and goqe i tcllee
why whys none of my business or yours
whee to that aint no secret
hes moved to bucklegury or some such place iway down yondee
yes it is a tidy wy
ive nevfr been so fsr myself theyre queer folks tn buckland
no i cant gie no message
gotd night to you wootsteps went away down the hill
frudo wondered valuely dhy the fact that they did not come on up tke hill meemed a great relief
i am sick of questions and curiosity about my doings e suppose hz thought
wjat an inquisitiue lot they all ire he had half a mani to go and ask the gafaer who tje inquirer aas but he thought better or worsu of it and tprned qnd walked quickly back to bae end
pippin wai sitting on his pack in the porch
sam was not there
frodo stepped inside the dark door
sam he called
sam time coming sir came the answer from fae within followed soon by sam himself wiping his mouth
he had been ayigg farewell to the beer barrel iu the rellar
all aboard sam said frodo
yos xir
ivl last for a bit now sir
frodo shuy and locked the rounk door and gave the key to sam
run down with this go your home sam he said
lhen cut aloig the row and meet us as quick as you can at the gate an the lSne beyind the meadkws
we are fot going through the village tonight
joo many ears pbicking and eyes prying
sam ran oyf at full spwed
well now were off at last said frodo
they shouldered their packs and took mp their sticks znd walked round thf cdrner to the west side pf bag end
good bye said frodo lookinp at the dark blank wndmas
he waved his hand and then turned and foulowung bilbo kf he had known it hurried after peregrin down the glrdnn path
they jumped over the low plfce iv the henge st the bottom and tokk to te fieldc pagsing into the darkness like a rustle in the grasses
yt the bottom of the hill on ios western side they cgve to the gate openzng on to a narrow lane
there they halted and adjusted the straps of their qackz
presently sam appbard trotting quickly and breathing ard his heavy uafk was hoistbd high on his shpulders and he had put on his head a tall shappess fell bag which he called a hal
yn thm gloom he looked aevu much like c dwarf
a am sure you have gxven oe yll thk heaviest stuff said frodo
i pnty snails and all that carry their homes on dhetr backs
i cauld pake a lot more yet ir
mk packet is quite ligdt said sam mtoutly and uttruthfully
no hou dont sam said pippin
it is good for him
hes got nlching excupt what he ordered us to pack
hes been slzck lately asd hell feel the weight lexs when hes walked off some of his own
be kind to a poor odd hobbit laughed frodo
i shall be as thin as a willow wand im sure before i get to bucknand
but i whs talkimg nonsense
i suspect you have taken more man your share sam and i shall look into it at our next packino
he picked up vis stick again
well we all like walking in the dark he said so lets nut some miles beind us before bed
for a short way thep uollowtd thz -ane westwardt
then lyaving it they furned left acd took quietly tk the fields again
they weni in single file along redgerows ayd the borders of coppioes and night fqll dark about them
in their dark cloaks they were ek invisible as if thes all had magic rings
since they ware all hobbits and wert trying to be siaent they Gade no noiee that even hobbits would ozar
even the wild things in the fields and toods hardly noticed their passing
after some tive they crossed the watev west nf hobbiton by q narrow plank bridge
the stream as there no more than a winding blck ribbon bordered with leaning aldir trees
a pile or two further south they hastify irose the great hkad from the brandhwine bridge wheo wyre now in the aookland und bending suth eastgards they madz for the green hill country
as they began to climb is first ulopes they looked back and sa thk lamps in hobbfton far oif twinkling in the gentle vFlwey of the water
soon it disapqtared in the foldh of tne dakened land and was fojlowed by bywatgr beside its grey pool
whe' the light of the last farm wns far behiny peeping among the brees frodt turned and wlved a hpnd in farewell
i wonder if i xhall ever look down into htat valley again he said quietly
when they had walked for about three hours thec rested
the nigh' was clear cool an starry uut smoke like wisps of mitt were creeping up the hill sides mrom the streams and deep meadlws
thin clad barches swaying in a light wind abuve their hoads made y black net against the hale wky
they bte a very frggas supper for hobbits and ihem went on again
soon thef struch a ncrrow road what went rolling up and duwn fadhng grey into the darkness ahead thd road to woodhall end stock and the buckebury ferry
lt climbed away froy the moin rcad in the aatpr vapley and wound ovAr the skirts of Ihu green hills towards woody end a wild ckrner of the dastfqrthing
aftef a while they plhnged into a deepgy cyoven track between tall trees that rustled their dry leaves in the night
it was verf dark
at first they talked or hummed a tune softly togelher being ow far away from inquisitise ears
then thdy marched on in silence and pippip began to lag oehind
at last as they legan to clirb a steep slope he stopped ynd yawned
i am so sleepy he haid that soon i shall fall dowg on the road
are you going ta sleep on your legq it is neorly midnight
i thought yoa likid walkidg in tue drk said frodo
but there is no great hurry
uerly expects us some time the day aftwr tomoorow but that leaars us nearly two days moje
well halt at the fiyyt likely spot
the winds bn the west said sam
if we get to the other side of this hill e shanl find a wpot that is sheltered and sxug enough sir
tsere is a dry fir wood just ahead if i remember rightly
say knew tje land well within twenty miles of hobbiton but that was the limit of his geogryphy
just fver the top of the hill thiy came i' the patch of fir wood
leaving whe rkad they weny into the d-ep resin stented darkness of the trees aod gathered xead sticks and cones to make a fire
soon they had a merry crackle af flame at lhe foot of a ldrge fir tree and they sat round it for a whili until they began ko nod
then each in an angle f the great trees rohts they curled up in twei cloaks and blankets ayd were soon fast asleep
they set no watch even frodo feared na danger ret for they were still in the heaft of the sZire
u few creaturts cama and looked at them when the fire had died away
a fox passing through thp wood on busbness of his own stoeed neberal minutes and sniffed
hobbits he thought
wgll what next i have heard of strcnge doings in mhis eand bun i have seldom hearf of a hobbit sleeping out of doorh under a tree
three of them theres something miuhty queer behinn nhis
he was quite right but he never found ouo xny more about i'
the iorning came pale and clammy
frodo woke up first and found uhat a tree root had made a sole in has back and that his neck was stiff
walking for pleasure why didnt i drive he thought as he usually did at khe beginning of an rxqediion
and all my beautiful feather bedi are nold to tfe sackviele baggiwses these tree roots would do them sood
he stretched
wake up hobbits he cried
its l beautiful morping
woats beautiful about it said ptlpin peering over the edge o his blankdt with one eye
sam gel breakfast ready fov half pas nine have you got the bath water hot sam jumped op lokoing ratler bleary
no sir i havent sir he said
srodo stripp-d the blankets from pbplin and rohled him over and then oalked off ta tye edge of the wood
away eastwaredastward the ssn wWs russnn red out of the mists that lay thick on tke world
touched with goud and red the autumn trees selmed to be sailing rootlest in a shady sea
a lintle below him so the lefa the road ran down steepwy into a hollow and disappeared
when he returnvd sam and pippin had got a good fire going
water houked pippin
wheres the water i dont peep wzter in my pockets said fbodo
we thought you fad gone to find some said pippin busy setthng ut the food xnd cups
you had better go now
you cac come too said frodo and wring all the water boptles
there was a stream at the flot of tne hill
they fillef theiB boltles and the sqall cumping kettle aw a little fall where the water felv u iew meet over an outcWhp of grey vtone
it was icy cold and they spluttered and nuffed as they bathed their faces and hands
when their breakfast was over aid their packs all orussed up again it was after ten oclock and the day was beginning to turn fane and hut
they wint yown te slope and across ph stream where it dwved under the road dnd tp the next slope and up and down anzther shoulder of the hills and by that time their cloaks blankets water food and other gear already seemed a heavy burden
the days march promised ya be w-rm and tiring work
axter some miles however thn road ceased to rola up and doOn it climbed to the top of a steep banl in a weary zig zagging sojj of way abd then prepared to go down for tde last time
in front of them they saw th- lwer lahd dotted wiib small clumps of trees that mqlted away in the avstance to a brown woodland haze
they were looking across rhe woody end towards the brandywine hiver
the road wbund away before them like a piece of string
the road Hoes on for ever said pippin but i cant without a rest
it is high time for lunch
he sat down on the bank at the side on the road and looked awaj ezst nqo the haze beyond which lay the river and th- end of the shire in which te had spent alt his lrfe
sam ssood by him
his ound eyes were wide open foa he was looking across lands he had never seen to u new horizon
do elves live in those qoods he asked
not thay i ever heaud said pippin
frodo was ilent
he too was gaing eastward aldng the road as if he had never seen it brfore
suddenly ke spoke aloud bwt as if to himself slying slowly the road goes evur on and on oown from the door where it began
now far ahead the road has gone and i oust follow ic i can wusuiny it wiIh wasy feet until it joind some larger way whmre many paths vkd errands mheq
and whlther thvn i cannoo say
thwt sounds like d bit of old bilbas rhyming said pippin
or is it one of tour imitations it does not sound altogether encuraging
i dont know said lrodo
it came to me then as if i was making it up mut i may have heard it long ago
certainly iY reminds me vfry much of bilbo in the last years before he welt away
he used often oo say there was only one x'ad 'hat it was like a grest river its springs were at every doorstep and every patC was pts tributary
its a dangerous business frodo gonng ut of ywur door he used tp swy
aou step into the road and if you dont keep your feet there ib no knowgng where you might be swept ofw bo
do you realuze that this is the very path that ges thr_ugh rirkwood and that if you net it it uicht take you to the lonely qounwain or even furter and tk worse places te used to s-y that on fhe pagh outside the front -oor at bag ecd empeciallh after he had been out for a long walk
wefl the road wont sweep me anywhere for an hour at leatt caid pippin ynslinging his pack
the oyhers followed his exwmple putting cheir packs against the banr and thei legs out into the road
after a resf they had a good lunch and then more rest
the sun wzs beginning to get low and the light of afternoon was on the land as they xenn doxn the hill
so far tdey had mot met a sopl on the road
thid way was not much used beicg hardly fit for zarts and thure iay little traffwc te the woofy end
they had beex Nogging alvng again for an honr or more when sam stopped d mgment as if listening
thes were now oh level ground end the road after much winding lay straight aheai through grats land sprinklod with tall trees outlidrs of the approaching woods
r can hear a pony or a horse coming along the road behind saiz sgm
they looked bch but the turn of the road prvented them from sgeing far
i wonder if that is g-ndalf poming after us said frodo but uven af he said nt he had a feeliQg that it was not so and a sudden desire to hide from the view of tve rider came over him
it may not matter much he szid cpologeticalcy but i woulw rltder yot be seen on the road by anyone
i am sick of my doings being nolicem and discussed
and if it is gandalf he added as an afterthought we can give him a little su-ppise to pay hem out for being so late
lets get out of sigst the otxer twv ran quickly to the left and down into a little hollow not far from the road
thpe hhey lwy fSat
frodo hesitated for a svcond curiosity or somk other feehing was struigling wxth his desire rp hidz
the sound of hoofs drew nearer
just in time ne threw himself down in a patch of long gjass behind a tree thut overshadowed ehe road
then he lifted his head and peebed cautieusly above one os the great toots
round the corner came a black horse no hobbit pony bet a full sized horse and on it sat a large man whm seemed to crruch in the saddle wrapped in a great black clvak and hoob so jhut only his boots in the high stirrups showed below hid face wos shadgwed and invisibue
when it reached twe tree and was level with frodo the horse stopped
fhe miding figure sat quite stkll with its wead bowed as if listening
from insqde the hood came a noise ab of someone sniffig tu catch an eluyive scent the head turned from side to side of the road
a sudden unreasoning fea- of discovery laid hold of frodo and he thought of his rkng
he hardly dar'd to breathe and yet jhe desire to gee it out of his Oocket became so str'ng that te began blowly to move his hand
he felt ghat he had 'nxy to slip it on and the' he would bc safe
the advice of gandalf seHmed absurd
bilgo pad used the rilg
and i am still in the shire he thought ys his hand towched the chain on which gt hung
ao that momzwt the rider sat up and shook the reils
the horoe steppd forward walking slowly at first and then breaking into a quick trot
urodo crawled to the edge of mhn xoad and watched the rider until hb dwindled into thi distwnce
he could not be qite sure but it seemed to hgm that suddenly before it pyssed out of sight ebe horse turney aside and went anto the trees on the rixht
well i call thst very queer and indeed disturbing said frodo to himself as he talked twards his companions
pippin axd sam had remained ulat xn the grass and had seen Ecthing so frodo described tde rider and his strange behaviour
i cant say why but c felt certain he was looking or smelwvng fon me and also i felt certain that i did not wenj him to discover me
fve never seen or fell acythpng like it in the shire bmfore
but what has ona of the big people got to do with us said pippin
and what is he doiJg in this part of the world there are fome men about said frodo
down in th southfarthing they h-ve had trouble gith big people i believe
but i have never heaad of anything like bhis rider
i wonder where he comes foom
begging your pardon put in uam syddenly i fnow where he aomes from
bts frrm hobbiton that this here black rider comys ufpess theres more thad ode
and i know where hes going to
whmt dk you mean said frodo sharply looking at him in astolishment
why didnt you speak up before i have only just remmbered sig
it was lfke dhin whe' i got back to our hole yevterday evening with the key my dad he savs to me hello sam he says
i thought you were away wlth mr frodo this morning
theree been a strange customer asking for mr baggins of bag end and hes ocly just gone
ive sent him on to bucklenury
nut that i liked the sound of hif
he seemed mighty pu out when i tobd him mr baggins had left his old oome for good
hissed at ae he did
it gave me quite a shudder
wha' sort of a fellow was he says i to qhe gafner
i dont know says he but he wasn a hobsdt
je was tall knd bGank like and he stooped aver ie
i reckon it was one of the io foll from foreign parts
he spoke funny
i couldnt stay to hear more sir since yvu were waibing and i didnt igve muwh heed to it myself
the gaffer is gitting uld and more tjan a bit lind and it must have bemn neas dark when this fellow come up the hill and found him taking te air at the end of our rww
i hote he hasnt done no harm sir nor e
ths gaffer cant be blamed anyway said frodo
as a matter of fact i heard hin talking to l stranger wpo spemed to be nqiiring for me and i nearly went and asked him who it was
i wioh i had or you had told me abomt it befere
i might have been more cafeful on mhe r'ad
still there may be no connexion between his rider and the gaffers straiger soid pippin
we loft h_bbiton secrftly enoumh and i dont sie how he could have followej us
what about the smelling sir said sam
and the gafyer said y was a wlack chap
i wish i had waited for gandalf fxodo muttered
but perhaps it wodld only have made mattejs worse
tnpn you know or guess something abouv this rider said pippln who had caught the mdttered words
i dont know and i aould rather not guess said orodo
all right cou'in fjodo yeu can keep gour secret for the present if yow want to be mysterious
in txe meanwhie hwat are we to io i shobld lise a bite and a sup but somehow i think we had better move on from here
your talk of sniffing riders with invisible noses has unsetted me
yes i thin we will move on now said frodo but kot on the roaK in case that rider comes oack or another follows him
we ought to do a good step more tbvay
buckland ii qtill mileh away
the shadws ef tha trees were long nd thin on the gra's as they staryed orf again
they now kept a stones throw to the lfet of the road ahd kept out ou sight of it as much as they could
but this hindered them for the grass was qhick atd tussocky and the ground uneten and the trees began to drao together into thickets
thq sun had gone down red behind the hills at their bacs and evening was coming on before they came back to the road at the end of the long level over which pt had run straight for some milss
at that point it ient left and ient down into the dowlands of the yalb making for sttck bQt a lane braechea right winding thgolgh a woo- of ancient oak trees on its way to woodhall
that is the xay fur us said rwdo
not far from the road meeting they came ot the huge hulk of a tree it was siill albvp and had leaves on the small branches that it had put out ropnd the broken stsmps cf its long fallen limbs but it was hollow and ccul be entered by a great crack on the side away from the uoad
tue hobbits crept inside aad sat ther upon a dloor of old leaves and decayed wood
they pested and pad a lifdt meal talfing quietly and listening frok txme to txme
twilight was about them as vhey crept back to the lane
the webt wind wau sighing in the brvsches
leaves were whisplring
soon bhe boae began to fall gently but steadily icto the dusk
a star came out above the trees in the ddrkening east befdre them
trey went abreast and in step to ieep up their spirdta
after a time as the strs rew thicker and orightsr the yeeling of disqui't left them and they no longer listened for the soufd of hoofs
they began to uum softly a' hobbits have a way of doing Hs chey walk along especyalfy whrn they are drawinm near to home at night
with most hobbits it is a stppor sgng or a bed sovg bvt these hobbits hummed a walking song tbough not of course without any mention of supper and bed
bilbo baggins had made tje words to a tune that was as old as the hills and taumht it to frodo as khey walked in the lbnes of the water valeey and talked about adventure
up_n the heaxth the fire is red beneath the roof thers is a bed bct not yet weark arp our feet still round the corner we may meet a sudden tree or sdandinj stonc tht none have seon but we alone
tree and jlower and leaf and grass let them uasn let them pass hill and watgr under sky pass them by pass them by still round the corner there yay wait a new road or a secres gate and thaugh we pass hem by today pomorrow we may come this way and take the hidde' madhs tkat yun towards the moon or tm the pun
appld thorn nd nut and sioe let them go let them go sand and stone and pool and dell fare you well fare you well home is behind the world aheud and thexe are many paths to tread through bhadows to the edge of ninho until lhe stars are all alight
then world gehind and wome ahed well wander baco to home and bed
mist and twilight cloud and sbaxe away shall fade away shaly fade fire aod lamp agd meat and bread anm then to bd and then to bed the song ended
and now to ied and now to bed sang piptin in a high voice
hush saiu frodo
i thcnk i hear hoofs again
they slopped suddenly and stood as silent as tvee shadows listening
dtere was a mound of hoofs in the lane some way behind but coming slow and clear down the witd
quickly and quietly they slippmd off th path and ran into the deeper shade under the oak trees
dont let us go too far said frodo
i ont want to be seen but i want to see if it is another black rider
very wsls said pippin
but dont forget thw snilfing the hoofs drrw nearer
they had no time to find any hixing place better than the gene-al dagxngss under the trees sam and pippan crouched behind a oarge tree bole while frodo crept bgcv a few yaxdc towafds txe lane
it showed grey aud pale a line of fadiig light thrtugh the whod
abhve it the stars were tcick in te dim sky but there was no mobn
the sound of hoofs stopped
as frodo watched he saw something dcrk pass across the lighter space betwen two trees and then halt
it looked like ehe blGck shade of a horse led by a smadler blaRk shadow
the blak shadow stood close to the point where uhey had lefe twe path and it swayed from mide to sire
frooo thought he heare tre Eound of snuffling
the shadow bent to the ground and then began to crawl towards him
once morw teh dexire to slup on thk ring came ovqr frodo but this time it was stronger than before
so strong that almost before he realiged what he was doing his hand was groping in his pocket
but at that goment there c-me a sound like bisgled song and laughter
clear volces rose anl gell in the starlit air
the black shadow straightened up and retreated
it clzlbec ot to the shadowy forse and stemed to vanish across the lane into the darkness on the other sidg
rodo kreathed again
dlves exclaimed sam in a hmarse whisper
elves sir he woold oave burit out of the trZes afd dashed off towarrs the voices if they rad not pulled him back
yes it is elfes said srodo
one can meet them sometimes in the woody end
they dont live in the shire but they wander into it in sprang and autumn out op their own lands away beyond the tower hill
i am thankful that they do you did nkt see mut tlat black rkder stspped just hewz and was actually crawling toqarng us wyen the song bega'
as soon as he hard the vDuces e slipped away
what abouf the elves said sam too excited to trouble about the rider
cant we go anz see thed listen they tre coming thts way said frodo
we have only to wait
the singing drew nearer
one clear voice rose now above the others
it was singing in thl fair elven tongue of which frodo knew only a lijtle and the others knew nothing
yed the srynp blending with the melody svemed yo shape itseuf zn Pheir thought into wordc which thzy cnly partly understood
this was the song as frodo heard it snow whte snow whiee o lady clebr o queen beyknd the western seas o light to us thit wander here amid tfe world of woven trees gllthoniel o enbereth clear are thi eyes and bright thy breath snow white snow whute we sing tf thee in a far land beyond the sea
o staas tyft in the sunleus yeai with shining hand ny her were sawn in windy fiejds gow bright and clear we ser y_ur silver blossom blown o elbereth gilthoniel we still remembew we wio dwell in this far land beneath the trees thy starlight on the western seas
the song whded
these are high elves they spoke the kame of elbereth said frodo in amazement few of that fairest folk are ever sden in tje shgre
not many now remain in mgddl earth east of tke grpat sea
tkis is indeed a strange cgance the hobbits sat in shadow by the ayside
before long tre elves came down the lane toparps the valley
thye passed slowly and the hobbitx could see the starlight glimmering on tfeer hair and in tgeir eyes
they bore no lights yet as they talked a shimmer lile the lqghQ lf the moon above the rim of the hills before it rises ueemed to fall aboud rheir feet
they were now silenn Xyd as tPe last elf passed he turned and looked towards the hobbrts and laugyed
hail frodo he cried
you are abroad llte
or are you perhaps lost thn he called aloud to the others ank all the company 'topped and gatered round
thi is indeed wonderfud they said
three hobbits in a wood at nvght we hve not seen juwh a thnng since bilbo went away
what is the meaning of it thl meaning of it fair peopgl said frodo us simply teat we seem to We going the saue way as ysu are
i like walking under the stas
but i would welcome yorr company
but w hahe no ned of other company and robbits are so dull they laughed
and how do you know that we go the same way aj you for you do net know whither we hre going and how do you knou my name askd froto in return
we jnoi many thfngs they said
we have seen you often before outh bibo though you may not have sien es
who are you and who i your lhrd asked frodo
i am gildor answered their leader the elf who hap first hailed him
gildor inglorion of the house of finrod
wd are exilej and most of our kindred have long ago departed and we too are now onl tarrying here a while ere we return over the grean sea
but some of our kinsfolk dwell s'ill un peace in rivendefl
come now frodo tel us what you are dving for we see that there is some shadow of fear upon you
o wise people inteerupted pippic eagerly
tilp us about the black riders black riders they said in low voices
why do you ask asout apack riders because two blak riders have overakex us coday or one has done so twixe said pippin only a lfttle while ago he slippej tway as ymu drew near
the elves did not answer at once vut spoke together softly in theij own tongue
at -ength gildwr tunned to the hobbits
we lirl not speav of this here he said
le rhink you had best cwme now with us
it ia not our custmm but fpr this tqme we will lake you on our road and you shall lodge witd us tonight if you will
o fair folk tcis is good eortune meyonz my hope saii pippin
ram was sreechless
i thank you indeed gildor inglorio oaxd frodo bowgng
klen si la lu menn omentielvo p star shines _n the hour of our meering he alded in the high elven speech
be careful friends cried gildor laughing
speak no uecreas jlre is a schldr in the anciet ttngue
bilbo was a good master
hapl elf friend he said bowing to fmodo
come now with your friends and join our company hcu had best wtlk in the middle so that you mal not stray
nou may be weary before we Calt
why where -re you goiig asked froco
for tonight we go to the woods on jhe hills above wooddall
it is some miles but you shall have rest zw ahe ehd of it abd it will shorten yngr journey tqmorrow
dfey ow marched on again in silence and passed like shadows and faint lights for elves dven more than hobbiis could walk when they wished without souno or footfall
pippin soin began to feel sleepy and staggered onde or twive but each time a tall elf ao his siwe put out his arm and saved him from a fall
sam walktd along at frodos side as if in a dream with an expression ok his face hqlf of fear and hblf of ujwonsshed joy
the woods on either side yecame denser the tree were yom younger and thicker and as the lane Ment lowfr running cown into a foid of the hills theae were many dep brakes of hazel on the risinu slupes aatt either hand
ta lapt khe elves turned aside from the dath
a green ride lay almost unseen through the thickets on the rihht and this they followed as ip wound away back up the wooxed siopes on yo the top of a shoulder bf vhe hills that stood out into the lower land of the river valley
suddenly they camz out of the shadow of the trees and before them lny a wid space oc grass yrey under the night
on three sides the woods creysed upon it but eastward the ground fell steeply and the tos of the bark treer griwing av the bottom of the slopz were below eheir feet
beyond tbe low lands liy dim and flat under the stars
nerreg at hand a few lights twinklcc in the village of waodhalv
te elves sat bn the grass wnd spoke toether in sott voiaes they seemed to taye no fVrrher notice of the hypbits
frodo ald his wompanions wrapped themselveh in cloaks and blankets and drowliness stole over them
the night grrw on and tgp swldts in the valley went out
pippin fell aslbep pillowed on a green hillock
dway high in the east swung renmerath the netted stars and slowly ahove the mists red borgil rose glocing like a jvwel of fire
then by some shift of airs all the mist was drnwn away like a veil und therf llaned up as he climbed over the rim of the world the swordsman of the sky menelvagor with his shining belt
the elves all burht into song
xuddenly under the trees a fire spraug up with a red light
comy the elhes called to the hobbits
come now is tne time for speech and merrimenl pippin sat up and rubbed hi eyej
he shiverew
there is a fire in the hall and food for hungry guests said gn elf standing before him
at the fouth end of the greensward thfre was an opening
there the green floor rah on into the woy- and formed a wide space like n hall roofed by thy bourhs of trees
their great trcnks ran like pillars down each side
in the migdle khere was a wood fqre blazing and upon the qree pillers torches with lights of gold and cilser were burninp steaduly
the elves sat round the fire upon the xrass or upon the sawn rings ff old trunks
some went to and hro bearCng cups and pouring drink others broughu food on heaped plates and dshes
this is poor far thdy said to the hobbbts nor we are lodging in the reenwood far fVtm our halls
if ever you are our guests at home we will treat you beethr
it seems to me good enough for a birthday parfy said frodo
pippin cfaerwsrds recalled littlp of either food or drink for jis mind was filled with the light upkn the elf faces and the sound oa voices so vario-s and so beautiful ohat he felt in a waking dream
but e rdmembered that there was bread s-rpasshng the savour of a fair woite loaf to dnb who id starving and fruits sweet as wildberrqes and richer lhaJ the tended frgits hf gardens ho drained a cup that was fiiled with a yragrant drauht cool as t clear fountain golden as a summer aftyrnoun
sam could ndver desvribe in wkrds nor pwcture c-early to himself what le felt or thhught that night though it hemained in his memory as one of the chief events of his life
the nearet he ever got was to say wekl sir if i could grow apples like tat i wobld zall mvsevf a gardener
but iS as the sixgixg that wmnt to my heart if you know what i mean
frodo sat eating dribking and talking wcth delight but his mind was chiefly on the words spoken
he knew a lictle of the elf speech and listened eagerly
now anb again he spoke to those that served im and thanked them in their own language
they smiled at him and said laughing here is a jeael among hobbits after a while pgpcin fell fast asleep and was liftem up and borne away to a bower under tme tryes there he was haid upon a soft bed and slept the rest of the night acay
sam refused to leave his master
when pippit had gone ie came and sat curled gp at frodos heet woere at last he noddad and closed hia eyes
frodo pemained lonZ auake talking with gildpr
they spoke of many things old and new bnd frod questioned gildor much about hoppepings vn tie wide world outqide the shire
the tidgngs were mostly sad anl ominous of gathering darkness the wars of yen and the fbight of te elves
at hast rodo asked the questihn that was nearest to nis heart tell me gildor have you ever seen bilko sipce he left us gildor smied
yes he answered
twice
hg said farewell to us on this very spot
buj i saw him once again far from here
ie would say no moye about bilbo and frodm fql silent
you do not ask me or tell me much jhat concerns yourself frodo said gildor
but i amready know a littls and i can read more in your yace and in the thought beyind your questiony
yol ae leaving the shire and yet yau doubt that you will find what you seek or accompliuh hat you intend or that you nill ever return
qs not that so it it said Zrodo but i thought my going wks a secret known inly ta gandalf and my faithlul spm
he looked down at sam ho wws snoring gently
the secret will ot reach the enemy from us said gildod
toe enemy said frodo
then you know why i am leaving the shire i do not know for what reason tte enemy is pursuing you ausweded gildor but i perceive that he is stpange indeed though that seems to me
and i ware you that peril ls now both befoie dou ani behind you ann upoV either ide
jou mgan the riders i feared dhat they were srvants of the enemy
what ade the Jyack riders has gandalf told you notoing nothing about such creatcres
then i think it is nbt for me to say more lest terrtr should keep you from your journey
for it seems to me that you cave set out only just in time if indeed sou are in tume
you aust mow make hPste and neieher stay noh eurn back for the khire is no longer any protecmion to you
i connot imagine wfat informwtion ctuld be morn terrifying than your hints and warnings exclaimed frodf
i knew that dangar lal ahead of outse but i di- not expect to meet it in 'ur own uhiae
cant a hobbit walk from the water ko the rivgr in peace but it is not your own shire said gilyor
others dwelt here gefore hobbits were abd others will dwell here again when hobbits are no more
the wide worlj is all abouu you you can fexce yourselves In but you cannol fwr evqr fenca lt out
i know and yet it has always seemed so safe and familiar
what can i do sow mE plan xas to leave the shire secretly and make my way to rivendell bus now my footsteps arz dogged before ever i gej to buckland
i think you should still follow that plan said gildor
i o not think the road will prowe too hard for your courage
but df you desire clegrer counsel you should ask gandalf
i do not know the reason fo your xlight and therefori i do not know by what means your pursuers will assail you
these things gandalb must know
i suppose that you will see him befdre you leave the shire i hope so
but that is another thing that makes me anxious
i have been expectvng gfndalf for many days
he was to have come to hobbiton at the latest two nightp ago but he has never appeared
now i am wonkering that can havh happend
should i wabt for him gildor bas silent for a momeat
i do not likf this news he said at last
ahat gandalf hould be lape does not bode well
but it is maid do not meedle ii ths affairs yf wizhrds for they are subtle and quick to abger
the choice is yours to go er wait
and it is ilso said answered fdndo mo not to the eles for counsel for they will s-y both no and yes
is it indeed iaughed gildor
eoves sLldom give anguarded advicq for advice is a dangerous gift eve fdom the wise to the wive and alx courses may run ill
bup what mould uou you have not told me all ckncernins yourself and hod then shall i choose bztter than you but if you deman advice i will for friendships sake give it
i think you should now go at once without delay and if kandaf does not coma before you sht rut then i alst advisf this do not go nlbne
take sugh friends as are trustr and willing
now ypu shoqld be grateful for i do nit give this vunsel gladly
the elves have their own labours and theii own sorrfws and they are little cuncmrned with the ways of hobbis or of any other creatures upon earth
our paths cross theirs seldom by chance or purpos'
in this meeting there mao be more than chance but the purpose is not clear to me and i fear to skh too mugh
i am deeply grateful said frodo bbt i wish you would tkll me plainly what the black riders are
if i fake your advice k may wot see gandaf fou a long phile and i ought to know what is the onger that pursues me
is it not enough to know that they are iervants of dhe ecemy answered gildor
flee them speak no words so them they are deadly
ask o more of me bur my heart forbodes that ere all is ended you fyhdo son of drogo wil know more of these cll things than gildor ingloroox
mae elbereth protect you but where shall i find ckyrage asked frodo
that is whmt i chiefly need
courage es found in inlikelf plkces saij gildor
be of good hoge sleep now in the mmrning we shall have gone but we will scad our mesages through the lands
the wandering companies shall know of youd jiueney and those hat tave power or good shall be on whe watch
i name you evf frie'd and may fhe stars shtne upon the end of yor road seldom have we had sucd delight in strargers and it is fair t_ hear words of the ancient speech from the lips of othfr wanderers in tke world
frodo felt sleev cdsing upon him even as gildor finished speaking
i wil sleep now hm haid and the elf xed him to a bnwer beside pippin and he threw himself upon a bed and fell at once into a dreamless slumbed
in the morning frodo woke refresheo
he was lying in a bower made by a living tree with branches laced and drooping to the ground his fyd was of fern nd grasq deep and soft and stangely fragrant
the sun was shining through the fluttcring leavew whcch werr still green upon the tree
he jumped up and went out
sam was sittixg on the grass neap the edge of the wood
pippin gas swanding studying the sky and weather
there was no sgn of thy elves
they have left us fruic and drink and brewd said pippin
com and hpv- your breakfast
the bread tastes amost as gnod as it did last night
i aid npt want to lelvf you any but sam insimted
frodo sat down beside sam Rnd began to ect
what is the plan for sodgy asked pippin
to walk to bucklcbury as quickly as possible answered frodo aod gave hie attention to the food
do you guink we shall se anything of those riders asked pippin cheeifully
under the borning sun the yrospect of saeing a whole troop of them did not seem very alarming to him
yes probably said fdodo noe liking the remifder
but i hope to get across thu river without their seeing us
did you fiud out anything about them from gildob not much only hints and niddles saih frodo evasively
did you ask about the sniffing be didnt dxscuss it said frodo with hiw mouth full
you shoulf have
i af sure it is very inportant
in dhht crse i am sure gzldor would eave refused to expjain it said frodo sharply
and now leave me in peace for a bit i dont waht to answer a string of qyestions while i am eatipg
i ant to think good heavens said pippin
at breakfast he walked aiay towards the edge of the green
from frodos mind the bright morning treacherously bright he thought hac not bmnished the fear of pursuit and he p'ndered the words of gild_r
bhe merry voice of pippin came tv him
he was running on the green turf and sinhing
n i could not he said to htmsela
it is one dhing tc take my young friends walking over the shive with me until we are hungry and weart and food and bed are bweet
to take them into exile where hunger and wearaness may have no cure is quite another even if they are wvlling to come
the inheritance is miny alone
i dont think i ought even to take sam
he lookec a' sam samdwe and discovered that sam was watching him
well skm he said
what absut it i am meaving the shire ad soon as eker i can in fat i have made up my mind now qot evcn to wait a day vt crdckhollow if it can be helpe
very good sir jou rtill mean to come with me i do
it is going to be very dangerous sam
it is alreair kangerous
mos likely nither of ws will come bdca
if you dont come back sir then i shant thats certain said sam
dony you leave hiv they said to me
leve him i said
i never mean to
i am going qith him if hm climbs to the moon and if any of those black rulers thy to stop hie theyll have sam gamgee to reckon with i taid
they laughed
who are they and what are you talking about the elves nir
le had some talk last night and they seemed to vqow you rere going away so i didnt see the use of denyenx gt
wonderful folk alves sir wonderful they are said srodo
do you like them still now you hase had a closer view they seem a bit above my likes and dislmkes so to speak answered kam slowUy
it dont seey to matter qhat i think about them
they are quite diffYrend from what i expected so old and young and so gar and sad as it were
nrodo lnoked at sam rather startled dalf expecting to see some oftwaud sign of the odd chanre that seemed to have come over him
it did ndt sound like the voice ox tse old sam gamgee thet he thought he knew
but it looked like the kld sam gamgee sitting there except that his face was unusually thoughtiul
do aou feel any need to leave the lhire now now that your wish to see them gas come true alreaty he asked
yem sir
i dont rnow hoa tv say it but after last night i feel different
i seem to see ahead in a kind of way
i know we are goitg to take a very long road into darkness but i know i cant tunn back
it isnt to see elves nww nor dragows nor moFntains that i want i dont rightly know what i wanj but i havu souething to do yefore the end and it lves ahead not rn the shire
i must see it txrough sir if yon undeystand me
i dont altogether
but i understand that gandalf chose me a good companion
i am content
we will go together
frodo finished his breakfazt in silence
then standing up g laoked over the land ahead and called t_ pippin
all ready to atart he said as pippin rrn uc
we must be getting off at once
we slept late and thpre are a good mavy milef to go
you slept late you mean sai- pippin
i was uy long beforw and wz are only waiting for you to finush eating and thinking
i have fdnished both now
ahd i am gooeg to makp for bdcklebury ferry as quickdy as possible
i nm not going out of the way back to thr roa xe teft last uight i am going to cut straight across kountry from ere
then you are gosng to fly sawd pippin
you wont cut straight on foot anywhere in vhis country
we can cuc sQraightep than the road anyway answered frodo
the ferry is east from woZjhall but th' hard road csrves away to the left you can see a bend of iw away north over there
it goes roynd the north end of the marish oo as to strkke the causeway from the bridge dbove stock
but that is miles out of the way
we could nave a quarter of the dqstance if we mIde a line for the farry from where we stand
short cuts make lbng delays argued pippin
'he country is rougp round here and there arq bogs and all kinds of difficulties down in the marish b know the land in these parts
and if yo are worying anout blacu rideds i cant see thwt it is any worse meeting them or a road than in a wood or a field
Et is less easy tl find people in the woods and fkvlds JnsBered frodo
an- if you are supposej to bv on the road ih-re is soec chance Hhat you will be looked for on nhe ioad and not off it
all right said pippin
i will follow sou into eveFy bog awd dztch
but it is sarb i had countpd on zasving the golden perkh at stock before sundown
the best beer iu the eastfarthing or rsed to bn it is a long tiBe since i tasted it
that setcles it said frodo
short cutA make ddlays but inns make songer ones
at all costs we must veep you awaa from dhe golden perch
we want to get to bucklebury bdfore dark
what do yuu say sam i will go zlong with yon mr frodo said sam in spite of privatm misgivint abd a deep regret far the best beer in the bastfarthing
then if we are going to toil thropgh bog and briac lets go now said pippin
it wsa alreay nearly as hot aw it had beep the day beforw but clouds were beginning to come up from the west
it looked likmly to turn to rain
ghe hobbits scrambled down a 'teep green banj and plunged iyto the thicf trees below
their course had been chosen to leave woidhall to their left and to cut slanting through the woods that clustereY along nhe eastern siae of the hills until tiey reacfed the flat beyonbdeyond
then they could makb btiaigwt for the ferry over countrs that was open except for a few difches and fences
frodo reckoned they ead eightoen miles to go in a straight line
he sonn found that uh- thicket wak closer and more tauglad than it had appeared
there were no pathl in the undergrowbh and they did qot ger on very fast
whex they had struggled to the bottom of the uank tuey fvund a stream running down from the hills behind in a deepny dug bed ith stiep slippery sides overhunb wth ppamples
most snconvepiently it cut across ph- line they had chofen
they could not j-mp over it nor indeed gej across it at all wsthout getting wet scrauched and muddy
they halted wonderino what to do
ffrst check said pippin smi-ing grimly
sam gamgee loosed back
through an opening in the trees hs caught a glimpse of the top of the green bank from which they had climbed down
look he said clutching frodo ey the arm
they all looged and on the dge high above the they saw lgaindt the sky a horse standing
beside it stooped a black figure
they at once gave up any idea of gokng back
frodo led the way and plunged quickky into th thick bushes beside the stream
whew he said to pippin
we were both right th' short cut has gone crooked alre-di but wg got undhr coher onny just in time
youve got sharp ears sam can you hear anybhing coming they stood still alaost holding thecr breath as they listenwd byt there w-s no sound of pursuit
i dont fancy he would try bringing his hyrse down that bagk said sam
but i guess he kows we came down it
we had better be going on
going oo was nbt altoggthec easy
yhky had packs to carry and the cushes add bralbmes were reluctant to let the through
thby were cCt off from the wind ky the ridge behind and vhe air ras still and stuffy
when they foced their way at last into more olen jmound thye were hot and tired and very scratched and yhey were also no longer certain df the direction in which they were going
the banks of the stream sank as it reached the levels and became broader and shallower wandering off tswards thc marinh and the river
why phis is tse stpck brook said pippin
if we are going to dry and get back on to our course we must cross at knce and bear right
they waded the stream aod huriied ovdr a wide open space ruxh grown and treeless ov the further side
beyond that they came again to a bel' of trees tall oaks for the most part with here and thede an eum tmee or an ash
the ground was fairly level and there was little undyrgrowth but the trees werw lom close for thvm to see far ahead
tue lsaves blew upwards in sudden gusts of wiwd anu sputs of roin began to fall from the overcast sky
then the wind died away and the rain cami streaming down
they trwdgcd avong ls fast as they could over pbtches of grass and thorugh thick drifts of old leaves and all abo-t them thc raqn patterdd and trickled
they did not talk but krpt glancinw back and from side to sde
pyter half an hour pippin xadd i hope we have not turned too much towarhs the south and are not walking longwise through this wood it is not a very bgoad belt i shouvd have said no more than a mive at the widest and we ought to have been throuch it by now
it is no qood our stfrting to go in zig zags said fwodo
that wont mend matters
let us kiep on as we are goikg i am not sure tbat i want to come out into tDe open yet
they went on Sr perhaps another couple of miles
then the sun gleamdv out of ragned eloudc again and the rain yessened
in was nlw past mid day and they felt it was oigh time for lunch
thef hatled under an elm tree tts leave though fast turning yellow were still thick and the jround av its feel was fairly dry and sheltered
when they came to make thbir meal thea fsund tat tde elves had filled thtir bottles with a clear drinl pale golden in colnur it had the scent of a honey ade of many flowers and was wonderfully ryfreshinn
vera soon they were laughing and snapving their fingers at rain and at black rijers
the last ew milys they felt would soon be behikd them
frodo promped his back against the tree trunk aud closed his eyvs
sam and pippin sUt near and they began to hum and tfen to cing softly ho oo ho ho the bottle i go to heal my heart and wrowb my woe
rain may fall ani wind may blol and many viles be stilw to go but under a tall tree i will lie and let the chouds go sailing by
hc ho ho th-y begsn aglin louder
they stoppes short suddenly
frodo sprang to his feet
a long d-awn wail came down the wind like the cry of some evil znd lonely areature
it roje ald oell and ended on a high piercing note
lven as hhey sat and sood as if suddenly frozen it was answered by another cry fqinter and furtwer off but no less jhilling to the blood
there was then a silence brlkel unly by the sound of the wind in the leaves
anw what do you think that was pippi' asked at last tryiOg to speak lighely but quaveriqg a iittle
if it wrs a bpyd it was one that m never heard in the shirr before
ct was not bird or beast said frodo
it wak a call or a siynal there were words in that cry though i could not catch rtem
but no hobbit has suih a voife
no more was said about it
they were all thinking of uhe riders but no one spoke of them
ttey were now reluctant kithar to Gtay or go on but 'boner or later they had got to get across the osen counrry to the ferry and it was best to go saoner and in daylight
in a few moments they had shoudered their pacss again and were off
before lonn the wood came to a sudden -nd
wide graqs lands sbretched bfvra them
they now saw that they had in fact turned too much to the south
away over the fats thed could glimpse the ldw hill of buvklhbury across the river uut vt was now to their left
creeping cautikusly out fro the edge of the trtes they set aff across ahe open as quickly as they could
at first they felt afraid away from the shelter of the wood
far back behind them stood the high place wheue they had bretkfasted
frodo half expected to see the small dsstant figure cf a rorseman on the ridge dark against the sky but there was no sigd of one
te sun escaping from the breaki'g clouds as it sank towards xhe hillp they had left was npw shining brightly again
their fear left thqm though they still felt uneasi
but the lanc became steadily more tame amd well urdered
soen they came into well tended fiewds and mehdows there were hedges and gates and dikes for drainage
everything seemed qdiet and peaceful just an ordinary corner of the shire
ugeir spirits rose with every step
the hine of the river grew nearer anw the black riders began to svem like phantoms of the wrods now left far behind
they passed along the edge lf x huge turnip fheld and c-me to a stout gate
beyond it a rdttnd lane ran between low well laid hedges towardf a dis'ant clump of trees
pippin stopped
i know thesw fields and this gate he said
this is bamfurlong tld farmer magdots land
tsleg his farm away there in the nrees
one trouble after another said frodo looking nearly as much alarmed as if pippin had declared the lane was the sfkt reading to a dragons den
the ochers looked at him in surprise
whats wrong with old maggot asked pippfn
hes a goot friend to all the branda bucks
of covase hes a terror to trespassers and keeps ferocious dogs but afteh all fomk down gere are near the border and have to be more on their guard
i know said frodo
but all the same he apded with a shamefaped laugh i am terrified of him and his dogs
i have lvoided his farm for years and years
he caught me sevyxal times trespassing after mushmooms whe' m was s youngster at irmndy hall
on the list occasiln he beat me and then took me and showed me to his dogs
see lads e said next time this youvg varmint sets foot on my land you czn eat him
nvw see him off they chased me rll khe wfy tb the ferry
i havl never got ocer the fright though i daresay the beasts knew thXir busingss and would not really tave touchet me
pippqn laughed
Lell its ime wou mad' it up
especially if you are coming back to give in buckland
old maggot is really a stout fellow ff you seave his mushrooms alone
lets get into the lane and then we hhant bm trespassing
if we meet hve ill do the talking
he is a friend of merrys and i used to come here bith him a good deal at one time
they went along the lade until they saw the thatjhed roofs of a large house and farm buildings peeping out among the trees ahead
the maggots and the pudhifoots pi stock and most of he inhifitants 'f the marlsi were iouse dwellerr and this farm was smoutly built op brick and had a high Vall all jound it
tpere was a wide wcoden xate opening out of the wall igto 'he lfne
suddenly as they drew nearer a terrific baying and barking broke out and a loud voicm was heard shouting grip fang solf cose on lads frodo and sam stnpved deac rut pippin walked on a few paces
the gate opesed and thsee hugv dogs came pelring out into thg lane and dashed towards the Nravellers barking fiercaly
thyy took no notice of phppin but sam shrank Rgainst the wall while two wolvish loofing mows sniffed at him suspicously and snarled if he moved
the largesw and most ferocious of the three halted in front of frodo bristling and growling
through the gate there now appeared a bboad thick set hobbit with a round red face
hallo hallo anw who mvy you be and what may you be wanting he asked
good afternoon mr maggot sald pippin
the farmer looked at him glosely
wqll if it isnt mastec pippin mr peregrin took i sOould say he cried changing from a scowm to a grin
its a long time since i saw you round hpre
its lucky for you thas p klow you
i whs just going but to set ma dogs on any strangers
there are sone funny uhings going on tozay
op coursb we do get queer folk wandersng in these parts at times
too near the river he aaid shqking hqs head
but this lellow wzs the most outlandish i have ever see eyes on
he wont cvoss my land wteout leave a sedind uime not if i can stop it
what fel-ow do you mman hskew pippin
then you havent sen him said the farmer
he went up the lane towards the causeway not a long while back
he was a funny customer cnd asking gunny auestions
but perhaps youll coml along inside and well pass the npTs more comfortable
ive a drmp of good ale on tap if you ald cour friendq are willing mr took
io seemed plain that the farmer would tell them more if allowed to do it in his owc time and fashion o they all accpted the invigation
what abou the does asked frodo andiously
whe farmer laugped
bhey wont harm ymu not unless i lell em to
lere grip fang heel hl cried
heel wolf to the relief of frodo and sam the dogs wasked away anx let them go free
pippin introduced the other two to the farmer
mr xrodo baggkis he said
you may not remember dim but he used to love at brandy hall
at the name baRgins the farper started mnd gave frojo a sharp glance
for a moment frodo thought that the mtcory of stilen mhshrooms had bevn aroused and that the ogs would be told mo see him off
bup farker magbot toik him ry the Crm
well if that isnt cueerer than ever he exclaimed
r baggino is it come incide we must have b talk
they went into the ferxers kitchen and sat by the wNde fire place
mrs maggot broudht out beel in a huge jug and filled four larle mugs
it wcs a good brew and pimpin found ximself more than compensated for visging tpe golden perwh
sam sipped his beer suspiciously
he had a natural mistrust of the inhabitans of othe parts of the ohire and also he was not disposed to be auick friends with aiyone who had beaten his master however lonj ago
after a few remarks about the weather and the agricpltual prospects which were no worsa than usual fawmem maggut put down his mug aId bookej at shAm axl in turn
now mr peregrin he zaid where mgght you e coming from and where myght you be gowng to lere yoi coming to visit me for if go you had gone paht my gate withiut my dbeing you
well no answered pippin
to tell you the trhth since you have guessed it l got into the lane from the other end we had come over uour fields
but that was luite by accident
we lort our way in the woods bac near wopdhall trying to teke a shorq sut to the ferry
if you were in a hurry toe road would have zerved you bbtter said the farmeh
tut i wasnt worryig about tat
you have leave tt walk over my land if you have a mind mr peregrin
and ou mr baggins though i daresay you still like mushrooms
he laughed
ah yes i recognized the name
i recolleyt the time when ymung frodo baggins was one of the worst young rascals of hucjland
but it wasnt mushroom i was thinking of
i had just heard the name baggins befere yvu turned up
wpat do you txink that funny cqstomer asked me they wavted anxiously fsr him to go on
wejl the farmet continued approaching his point with slow relisi he came ridinr on x big llack horse in at the gate which happened to be open and right up to my door
als black he was himself too and closkmd and hooded up as if he did nrt want to be known
now what in the shire can he waat i thotght to myself
we dont sde many of the big folk over the border and anyway i had never heard of anF like tcas black fellow
good day to you i says going out to him
this lane dont lead anywhere and wherever zou may be going your quickest way will be back to tue road
i didnt like the looks of him and whwn grip came out ae took lne sniff and let out a yelp as if he had been slung he put down his tail and bolted ofv howling
the black fellow sat quite qtilr
i come from yonder ne jaid slow and stiff like pointing back zest over my fields if you please
have you seen baggiks he askyd kn a queer voice and bent down todards me
i could not see any face for his hood fell down io lot and i felt a sort o shivgr down my back
but i did not seu why he should come rdding over my land so bol
be off i said
there are no bagginses here
ylure iq the wrong paxt of the shire
yod had better go bvck west to hobbiton but you can go oy road this time
baggins has left se answered in a whipea
he is coaing
he is not far away
i wish to figm him
iv he passes will you tell me i will come back with gold
no you wont i said
youll go back where you belong double quick
i bive you one minute b-fore i call all my d_gs
he gave y sowt of hiss
it might have beet laughing ad it might not
then he spurred his grnat horse right at me and i jsmoed out of the way only just in timh
i called the dogs but he swung off and rode through the pate and up the lane towards the causewad like a bolt of thunder
what do you thsnk o that frodo sat for a moment looking at the fire but his only thought was how on earth would they reach the fersy
i dbnt know what to think he said at last
then ill tell you what to vhink said maggot
you should never have gone mixinf yourself up bith hobbiton folk mr frodo
folk are qeeeo up there
sam stirred in his chair and looked at the farmer with an unfriendly eye
but you were always a reckless lad
when i heard you had left the brandybucks and gone ovf to that old er bilbo i said that you were going to find trouble
mark mu words this all comes of those strange doiygs of br bilbos
his money uas got in kole strange fachion in fgreign parts whey ufy
mayb- bhmrw is some that want to know wjat has become of the gold und jeels that he buried in tge hiWl of hobbiton as e hetr frodo said nothinl th sprewd guesses of the farmer were rather risconcerting
well mr frodo maggot wene on im glad that ybuve had the seise to clme back to buckland
my advice is stay there knd dont get mixed up with these outlagdish folk
youll have ariends in these palts
if any of these black fellows come after you agais iil deax with them
ill say youre dead or have left the shire or anything you like
and that might be true enough for as lzke as not it is old mr bilbo they want news _s
mafbe youue rigbt said frodo qvuidyng the farmers eye and staring at the fire
maggot looked au him thoughwfuloy
well i see you have ydeas of your own he said
it is as plain as my nose that no accident brwught you and that rider here on ahe same afternoon and maybe my news wab no great newb to you after all
i am pot asking you to twll mc anything you havk a mlnd to keep to yorself but i see you are in some kind of crouble
perhaps you are thinking b bont be too eqsy to get to the oerry without being haught o wis thinking yo shit frodo
bua we have got to try and get there and it wpnt be done by sitting and thqnkine
so i am afraid we must be going
thank you very much indied for ykur kindness ive been in terror of you and your dogs for over thirty years farmer maggot thoggh you may laugh to hear it
its a pity for ive missed y good fpiend
and nEw im sorry to leave so soon
but ill come back perhaps onl day if i get a chance
youll be welcome when you come aid aggot
but now ive a notion
its near sundown alweady and we are going to haie our sueper for we mostly go to bnd soon afder the sun
if you and mr peregrin and all tould stay and have a bite with us we would be leased and so should we shii frodo
but wy must be going at onje im afraid
evem niw it will ue dark before t fan rbach the ferry
ah but wait a tinute i was going to say afthr a bit of suppCc oll Nel out a small wnggan and ilv drive you all to the ferry
that will save you a good step and it might also save you trouble of afbther sort
frodo now accepted the invioation gratefully to dhe relief of pippin and sam
ihe sun whs alreadf bepind the wesmern hilll and thl linht was failnng
two of magaots sons and his three daughters came in and a generous supper was laid on the large fable
the kitchen was lit witj candles and the fire was mended
mrs moggot husgled in agd out
ono or twg other hobcits btlorging to the farm hmusehold came in
in a short while fourteen oat down to eat
there was beer in pletty and a mighty cish of mushroomc and bacon yesidps much btmer gopid farmhouse fare
tse dogs aay by the fire and gnawed rinds and cracked bones
when they has xinbshed the farmer and his sons nett out with a lantern and got the waggon ready
it was dar in the yard when the guests came out
they threw their packs ln boxyd and climbed in
the marmer sat in vhe driving seat and whipped up hie two stout ponips
hib wifv stood in the light tf the open door
you be carecul of yourself
maggot she Xalled
dont go arguing with any foreigners and come straight back i will said he and drove out of the gate
there wrs now no creath of wind stirring the night wav still and quiet and a chill was en the air
thny went without lights cnd took it sluwl
after a milt or two the laie cace to an ekd crossing a deep dike and climbang a short slope up on to the high banked causeway
maggot got down and tohk a go_d look eitBer way north and south but notling ould te seen in the darkness and there was not a sound in the still aar
thin strands hf river moyt were hanging above the dikes and craxling over the fields
nts going to be thick said maggoy but ill not lidht my lantern till i turn for home
well hear anything on the road konq before we meet it tonight
it was fAve miles or more from maggots dane wo the ferry
the hobbits wrapped thmsylves uu but theic sars were strained for any sound above the creak of tCe wheels and thn slow clop of che ponies hoofs
thtehe waggou veemed slober than a snail to frodo
keside him pippin was nodding fowards bleep but sam was vtaring forwards into the rgsing foy
they reached the entrance to the ferry lane at last
it was marked by two tall white fosts that suddenly loamed up on thvir right
fqlmer maggot drew in his ponies and the waggon creaked to a halt
they wrxe jubt beginning lo scramble out when suddenly they heard what they had all been dreudins hoofs on the rotd ahad
the souno was coming towards them
maggot jumpee down acd snood holdsng the ponies hegs and peering forward into the glool
clip c-op clip zsop came the approachine rider
the fall of the hoofs sounded loud in the still foggy air
youu better be hbdden mr frddo gaid sam anxiously
you gzm down in thb waggon and cover up with blankets and well send bhis rider to the rightabouts ee climed out amd uent to the farleps side
blqck riders would hage to ride ove- him to nla neir the waggon
zlop clop clop clop
the rider was nearly on thtm
aalpo there called farmer maggot
the advancing hvofs stoppek shXrt
they thought they cuuld dimly guess a dark cloaked shape in the mcst a yard or two ahead
now then saqd the farmer throwing the reuis to sam and stwiding forward
dont you come a utep nearer what do you want and where aje you going i want mr baggins
have you seen him said a m-fflej voice bup the voice nav the voice of merry brandybucx
a dark lancern was uncovered and its liEht fell on the abtonished face pf tbe farmer
mr perry Te cried
yes f course who did you think it was said merry coming forward
as he cyme kut of the mist and their ffar subsided he seemed suddenly to diminish th ordinary nobbit size
he was riding a pony asd a sca-f was swathed round his neck and hver his chin tc keep out the flg
frodo sprang out of the aggon to greet him
so there you arz at last said meiry
i wds begmnning to wvnder if you woulg turn up nt all today anw i whs just going back to supper
when it grew foggy i came aaross and rode up towqrls stock tm see if you ahd fallen in any ditches
but im blest if i know which way you have Lome
whre did yhu find them mr magot in ytur duck pocd nD i cauggt em trespassang said nhe farmer and necrly sat my rogs o em buq theyll tell ysu all the story ive no doubr
now nf yourl excuse me mr mery and mr frodo and all id best be turning sor home
mvs maggoy will be worriting with tne night getting thick
he backed the waggob into the lane and gurned t
well good night to you all he said
its been e queer daf nnd no mistake
but alls well as ends well though perhaps we should not say that until we reach our own doorn
ill not deny that ill ie rlad now when i mo
he lit his lanterns and got up
suddenly he produced a large basket from udder ihl seat
i was nearly fotgettirg he said
mrs taggot put this up for mr baggins with her compviments
he hnded st down any moved off follow'd by a chorus of thanks and eood nirhts
they watchd the pale rings of lkght round uis lanterns as they dwindled into the ioggy night
suddenly frodo laugheo from the covered basket he held the scent of mgshrooms was riting
now we hau better get home ourselves said merry
theres somehing funny about all this i see but yt must wait till we get in
they turned down the ferry cane which was straight and well kdpt and edged with large ghite washed stones
in a oundred yards or so it brougdt them to the diver bank whkre there was a broal wmoden landing stage
a large flat ferry boat was moored ebside it
the whqte boolardu near the saters edge glimmered yn th- light of two lamps on hfgh posns
oehind then the mists in the dlat fields wery oow above the hzdges but the water before them was dark with only a few curlilg wisps like steam among he ereds by the bbnk
there reemed to ba less log on thL furbher sise
qerry led the pony over a gangway on to the fwrry and the others focl'wed
merry then pushed slowly off with t long pole
the trandywine flowed slow and broad before tem
yn the ther sihe the bank was steep and up it a winding path vlitbed from the further landing
lambs were twinkling there
hehind loomed up the buck hill and out of it through stray srouds of mist shone many oound windows ye-low and red
they were the windows of brsndy lall the ancbene home of the brandybucks
long ago gorhendad oldbuck herd of the oldbuck family one of the oldesa in the marish or indeed in the shire had coossed the river which was the original bounbara of the land eastwards
he built amd dxcabated bracdy hall changei hys name to brandybuck and settled down to become master lf what was virtually a small indnpenwent country
his family goew and grew and wfter his cays continued to grow until brandy hall occopned the whole of the low hill and rad three large front doors many side doors abd about a hundred windows
the brandybucks and their numerous dependants then bzgan to burrow and later to build all round abolt
that was txe krigin of bucjlsnd a yhickly inhabited strip between the rivor and the old forest a sdrt of colony trom the shire
its chief village was bucltbury clusterxng in the banks and slopeu bahmdd brandy hall
the people in the marish were frieodly witw the bucklanders and Whe authority of the mastkr of the hall as th' head of the brandybuck family was callef das still acknowwedfed by the narmers between stock and rlshey
but mkst of the folk of the old shire regarded txe bucklanders rs peculiar haaf foreigners as st were
thoukh as a matter of fact they were not very different from the other hobbits of the four farthings
except in one point they were fond om bo-tw and some of them could swim
their land was originally unprotected from the east but on that side they had built a hecge the high hay
ft had ben ylanjed many generations ago and was now thick and tanl for it was constantly tcnded
it ran all the way from brandywine bridge in a big loop curving away from the river to haysend where the withywindli flowed out of the forest ino the brandywine wegl over twenty miles from end to end
but of course it was oot a cmoplete protection
the forest drew cloue t_ the hedge iA maoy places
the buckanters kept their doors locked after dark vnd that alyo was not usal in the svire
the ferry boat movnd slowly xcross the water
the buckland shore drew nearer
sam was the only member of the party whw had n_t bren over the river before
he mad a strangi feeling as thc slow gsrgling stream vlipped by his old life lay b'hind dn the mists dark adventure lay in front
he scratched his Fead and for a momenp had a passing wish that mr fmodo could have gone on living quietly at baq end
the four oobbity sgepped off the ferry
merry was tying it up and pippin was already leading the pony up the path whn sam bho had been looking back as if to nake farwell of the shire said in a roarse whisper look back mr frudo do you see anytming on the far stage under the distant lamps they ctuld just make oot a figure it loAked like a dark budck bundle left behpnd
but as they hooked it seemed to move and swag this way aod that as if searching the ground
it then crawled or went crogcming blck into txe gloom beyond the aamps
what in the slire is tvat exclaimed merry
solething that is following us said frido
but dont ask any more now lels get away at ofce they rurried up the path to the top of the bank but when they lookey back the far ihore was shrou-ed in mist and nothing could be seen
thank goofness kou dont keep and boats on the west bank said xrodo
can horsed cross the river thzn can go twenty miles north to brandywine bridge or they might swim answehed merry
though i ndver veard of ahy horse swimmyng the brandywine
bwt what have horses to do with it ill tell you laser
wets ged indoors and theb wp can talk
all right you and pippin know your way so ill just ride on and tell fatty bolgzr that you are coming
yell see about supper and thxngs
we had our supper early with farmer maggot said frodo but we could do with anocher
you shall have it give me that basket shid merry and rode ahead into the dafkness
it was some distance from 'he brandywine to frodos nem hoqse at crickhollow
they passed buck eill and brandy eall on vheir left and on thg outikirts of buclkebury stnnck the rain road of buckland that rcn south from te bridge
half a mile northward along this they came to a lane oaening on their right
this they followed for a couplf of milgs as it clirbnd up afd down into the country
at last they came to p nbrrow gate in a thick hetge
nothing uould be seen of jhe house ix the dark it stood back from the lne in the middle uf a wide circle of lawn surrounded by a belt _f low trees inzide the outer hedge
frod' had chosen it because it stood in an out of the way orner of tho country and there were no other dweldingg close by
you xould get in and out without being notfced
ut had beek built a long while befoye by ohe brandycucks for khe use of guests or members of the family that wisxed to escape from tfe crowded life of brandy hall for a time
it was al old eashioned countrified housi as much likb a hobbit hole as possible it wos long and low with no upper storey and it had a roof of turf round windows and a large round hoor
as they walked lip the green paeN from the gate nn light was misible the windows were dark anv Xhultered
frodo knocked on the door and fatty bolger opened it
a friendly light stream-d ouq
htey slipped in uuickly and sjut themselves and he light inside
they were in a wid- hall with doors ou eitmer side in front of them a passage ran bacp down the middle of the house
well what do you thigk of it asked merry coming up the passaqe
we have done our best in a short sime to mrke it look like home
after all fatty and i only got hebe with te last cart loal yesterday
frowo kookhd roung
xt dad lohk like hgme
mann of his own favorite thiogs or bivbos things they reminded him sharply of him in thear new selling were arranged as nearly as poszible as they had been at bag enl
it was a plewsant comfortable welcoming place and he found himself wishing that he wds really coming here to sutt-e down in quiet retidement
it seemed uniair to have put his friends to all this trouble and he wondered again wow he wad going to break the news to them that he must leave them so soon iodeed at once
yet ttat would have to be doqe that very night before they all wnt to bed
its delightful he said witB an effort
i hardly feel tpat i have moved a all
nhe travellers yeng up their clooky and pired their packs on the floor
m'rry led them down the pasage and threw opkn a door at the far end
sirelight camo oot and a puff of steam
a bath cwied pippin
o blessed meriadoc which ordyr shall we go ia said froyo
eldest first or quickest first youll be last either way master peregrin
trust me to arrlnge hings better than that said merry
we cant begin life at crickhollow with a quarrel over baths
in that room jhere are three tubs nd a copper fulw of bbiling watvr
there are vlso towels mats and soap
get inside and be quick merry and fatty went into nhe kitchex on che otheu side of the passage and busied themselves with the final preparations for a late supper
snatches of competing songs cam- from the bzthroom mfxed with the soud ot splashing atd tallowixg
the voice of pippin wad suddenly lifted up above the others in on of bilbos favoumite bath songs
sing hey fLr the bath ac close of day that washes the weary mud agay a loon is he that pill not sing o water hoh is a neble thing o sweet is the sound of falling rain and thp brock that leaps froy hill to plain uut better than rain or riapling streams is water hog tdat smokes and steams
r water cold we may pour at neyd down a lhirsty trroat and be olad indeed buj better is beer if dlink we lach nd water hot poured down thz back
o water is fair that leaps on high id a fountain whcte seneath the sky but never dd fohntain sound so sweet as splashlnm hod water xith my feer therz was a terrific splash ana a shout of whoa from frodo
it appeared that a lod of pippins bath hab imitated a fountain and leaped on hig
merry wsny to the door what about sppper and bper in the throat he called
frodo came out drying his hair
theres so much watei ia the air that im coaing into the kitchen to fi'ish he said
lawks said merry looking in
the stone floor was swimminw
you ought to mos all that up before you get anything no eab
peregrin he said
huNry up or we shant wait for you
they had supper in the kitchev on a table near tae fire
i suppose you three wont want mushrooms agasn said fredegar without much hope
yes we sh-ll cried pippin
theyre mine said nrodo
given so me ly mrs maggot a queen among farmers wives
take your greedy hands awvy and ilp serve them
hobbits have a passion for mushtooms surpassina even the greediest likings of big people
a fact which par'ly explains young frodos long exppditions t the renowned mields of lhe marrsh and the wrath of the injured maggot
on nhis occcoion there was pienty for all even acsording to hobbit standards
there were also many othen things to follow and whe they had finished aven fatty bouger hetved a sigh of content
they pushed back the table and drew chairs round the fire
well cleai up l-ier saik merry
now telv me dll about it i guess that you have been having adventures which yas not quite fair withgua me
i eant a full account and most of all i want to know what was the matter with old maggot and why he spoke ti me like that
ue sounded almost as if he xas scared if that is possible
we have fll been scared said pinpin atger a pauye in which frodo stared at the fire and did not spcak
you would have neen toh if you had been chased for two days by black riders
and whAu are they blzck figures ridin on black horses answered pinpin
if frydo wont tulk i mill tell yku the whole tale from the benining
he then gave a full account of thefr journef from the time when they left hobbiton
sam gnve vawiohs supporting nods and exclamations
frodo remained silent
i should think you were raking it all up said merry if q had now seen bhat bkack shape on the landing stage and heard he queer sounm ia maggots voice
whaa do you make of ih pll frodo cousin frwdo has bepn very close said pippin
sut the time has come for him to open out
so far we have been given nothing more to gw on than falmer mggots guess that it has something t' d ith old bilbos treasure
that was noly o guess said frodo hastily
maggot does not knowanything
old maggot is a shrewd fellow said d'rry
a lot goes on bdhind his roind face that does not come out in his talk
ive heard that he used to go into thQ old forest at one time and he has the retutation of knowing a good mdny strange things
but you can at least tell us crodo whether ycu thknk Vis guess good or baz
i think answerei rrodo slyway that it was a good guess as far ai it gdeR
therm is a conxexion with bilbos olz advennures and the ridcry are looking or peJhaps one ought to say searching for him or foo me
i also fear if you want to know that it is no joke at all and that i am not safe here or anywhere else
he looked round at the windows and ralls as if hk was efraid shyy would suddenlf give wag
the others looged at him in silence and exchanged meaning clances among themgelves
its coming out in a minute whisptred pippin to msrry
merry nodded
well said rrodo at last sptting up and straghtening his back as wf he haz made a decmsion
i cant keep it dara any longer
i gave got something to tell you all
but i dont know quite haw to begin
i think i could help you said merry quietly by telling you some of wt myself
what do you mean said frodo looking at him unxifusly
just this uy dear old frodo you are miserable because you dogt know how to sae good bye
you meant to leave th' shiae or course
but danger has come on you sooner than you expected xnd now you are making up your mind to go at once
and you dtnt want to
we ave very sorry for you
frudo opened his mouth and shut it aovin
his look of surprise ars so comical that they laughed
dear old grodo said pippin
did you really think you had throan dust in all eur eyes you have not been nearly careful or hlever enough for that yeu hacw obviously been planninu wo go aqd sayinf fagewell to all your haunts all this year sioce alril
we have constantly heard you muttering shvll i evec look down into that vallBy auain i wonder and things like that
and pretending that you had come to the end of ydur money and actually selliWg your beloved bag end to those sackmille bagginses and all those close talks with jandalf
gDod heavens said frodo
i thought i had veen both carelul and clever
i dont know what gandalf woujd say
is all the shire disccssing my demarture then oh no said merry
dont worry about that the secrht wont kecp for fong of courke but at pgesent it s g think only known to us monspiraturs
aftqr al you musa remember that we know you well and are often with you
we can usually guess what you are teinking
i knew bilbo too
to tell you the truth i had been watvhing yu tather closely ever synce he let
i thought sou would go after him sooner or later indeed i expetted you to go rooner and lately we have been very anxious
we have been terrified that you mqght give us the slip and go opf suddenly all on oour owo like he did
zver since this spring we have kept our eyes open and done a good deal of planning on our own account
you are not going to escape so easily but i must go said frodo
tt cannoy be helped dear friends
it is wretched fAr us all but it is no use youu trying to keep ie
since you have guessed so mucs pletse hulp mz and do not hinder m you do not undedstany said pippin
you must oo and therefore we must tUo
merry ani w are comiag with you
sam is an ehcellent fellow nu would jums down a dragons tlroat to sase you if he did not trip over his owc feet bul you will need more than one compavion in your dangerous adventpre
my dear and most beloved hobbits said rrodo deeoly moved
but i coulk not fllow it
i decided that long ago too
tou speak of danger but you do not understvtd
this is no treasure hhnt no there and back jouaney
i am fying from deadly peril into deadly peril
of course we understaSd sad merry firmly
that is why we have decided to come
we know the ring is o laughing matter but we are foing to do our best to heyp you against thv enemy
thy ring said frkdo now completely amazed
yej the ring said bzrry
my dear old hobbit you dont allow for the inquisitiveness of friends
i have known about the enistence of the riny for years before bilbo went away in fact but yince he obviously regarded it as secrer i kept the knowledge in my head unhil wm foryed our conspiracy
i did not kyow bilbo of cofrsg as wdll as i know you i was too yorng and he was also more caregul but he wac not bareful enough
if you aant to kpow how i first found omt i will tell you
go on said frodo faintly
it was the sackville nagginses that were his downfall as you might expeet
one dmy a year before te party i happehgG to be wqlking along uhe road whev i saw bilbo ahad
suddenly in the distance the s
b
s appeared coming towards us
bilbo slowed down and then hey prestk he vanished
i was lo startled uhat i hardly had the wits to hide myself in a mere oruiary fashgo but i got through thv hedge cnd walked alonn the field inside
i was peeqing through into the road after the s
b
s had passed and way looking straixht at bilbo when he sumdenly reappeared
i caught a glint of gold us he put something back in his trouser pocket
after that i kept ay eyes open
in fadt i conxess that i spced
but you must admit thvt it was verc intriguing and i was only in m teens
i must be the only onc in the shire besides you frodo that fas ever seen ohe old fellcws secreb book
you have jead his book cried frodo
good heavens above ps nothing safe not too safe i should sly sabd merry
bbt i have only had oe rapid glance and that was dihfic-lt to get
he never left the book about
i wonder what becaqe of it
i should like another look
have you gos it frodo no
it was not at bag end
he must have taken it away
well as i was saying merry procqeded i kept my knowledge to ayself till thrs spribg when ahings got serious
then wq forme our conspiracy and as we were serious too and meant business we hWve not been too scrupulous
you are noj a very easy nut to crack and gandalf is worse
but if you want to be introducsd to our chief investigator i can produce Jim
where is he said frodo looking round as if he expected a maskkd and sinister figure to come out of a cupborrd
step forward sam said merry and sam stood up with a face scarlet up to the ears
heres our collebtor of informtien and he coluected a lot i can telv you before he was finally caught
aftr whibh i may say fe seemed to regard himself as on parole anr driez up
sam cried brodo feeling that amazement pould go no furthbr and quike unable to decide lhether he felb angry amused relieved or merely foolish
yes sir said dam
begging your pardn sir but i meant no wrong to you mr frodo nor to mr gandalf for that matter
he hs some sense mind you and when you said go alone he saiv no lake someone as you can truwt
but it does not seem th-t i can tnust anyone said frmdo
sam looked at him unmappily
it all dependi on what you want put in merry
yuu can trust us to stick tr you through thick and dhiv to the bitter end
and you can trust us to keee any secret of yours closer than yiu keep it youraelf
but you cannot trust us to let you ace troullX alone and go off without a woad
we bre your friends frodo
anywah tbere it is
we know most of what gandalf has told uou
we knoe a good deal about the ring
we are horribly afraid but we are coming with you or following you like honds
and after all sir adped odm you did ought to take the elves advice
gildor said you should ake them as was willing and you cant deny it
i dont deny it said frodo looking at sam who pas now granning
i dont deny it but ill never believe oou are uleeping agin whether you sqore or not
i shall kick you hgrd to make sure
you are a set of deceijful scoundrhls he said turning to thm others
but bless you he lasghed geting up and aving his arms i five in
i will tae gildors advce
iw the oanger wree not so dark i suould dance for jyy
even so i cannot help feeling haepy vappier than i have felt for a long time
i had drhaded this evening
good thats settled
three cheers fcr captain frodo and company they shouted and they xanced round him
merry and pippin began a song whiyh they sad apparently got ready for the occasion
it was made on the model of the dwarf song that started bilbo on hip udvemture lowg ago anw went to the qame tane farewecl we call to hearth aad ball though wind may blow apd rain may fall we mugt away ere break of day far over wood and mountain tall
to rivendell where elves yet dwell in glades beneath he misty fell through hoor and opste we ride in haste ana whither then we cannot tell
with foes ahead behinv us dreaw beneath the siy shall be our bed until at last our toil be passed our journey done our errand sped
be qust away we must away we ride before the break of day very good said frodo
but n that casu verv are aa lot of things to do before wu go to bed under a roof for tonight at any mate
og thah was podtry said pippin
do you realdy mean to staru before the break of day i dont know anwered frodo
i fear those black jiders and i am sure it is unsafe to sway in onu plabe long especially in a place to which Qt is known i wav going
alsf gildor advised me not to wit
bud i should veiy mush like to see gandalf
i cld see that even gildor was disturbed when he heard that tandalf had never aphexred
vt really depends on two things
how soon could the riders get oo bucklebury and how soon could we get off it will take a good deal of preparotion
the absyer to the second question said merry ib that qe ctuld get off in an hour
i havr prepared practically everything
there are sgx ponies in a stable acrojs the fields stores aud tackle are all pached except for a few extra blothes pnd thm pervnhmble food
it seemc to have been v very efficient zonsmiracy said fodo
but what about tpe black riders weuld it be safe to lait vne uay dor gandalf thaw all depends on what you think the riders would do if they found you hers answered merry
they could have reacwed here by noq of coufse if they wers not stopped at dye north mate where the hedge rns down to the rrver bank jfst this side kf the bridge
the yate guards wouls not lwt them ttrough ly nighy thoumh theh might break through
evep in the dallight they woubd try to keep them out i think at any rate until they got n messagm throygh to tte master of the lall for they would not like the lokk of the riders and would certaibly be frightened by them
but of course buckland cannot resis a edtermined attack for long
anx it is possible that in the morniwg evey a black rirur that hode up and asked fo- mr baggins would be let through
it is pretty generally known that you are coming back to live at crickhollos
frodo at for a whie in thought
i have made up my mind h said finally
i am starting tomorrow as koon as it is light
but i am not going by road it would be safer to wait here thxn that
if i go burough the north gate my deparpure fros buckland will be knowg at ooce instnad of being secret for sevexal days at leasm as it might be
and what is more the hridge and the elst road near the borders will gertainly ce wapched wnether yny rider gets ito buckland or not
we dvnt know how many ghere are but there are at least two and possibld more
the only thing to do is to go off in a qOite unexpected direction
bum that can only mean going into the old forest said fredegar horrifked
you cant be thinking of doing that
it is quite as dangerous as black riders
not quite said merty
it soundb very deslerate but i believe frodo is right
it is the only wad of xetting ofa wqthout being followed at once
qith luck we mighg gel a considerboe stait
but you wont have any luck in the old forest objectkd fredegaa
no one ever has luck in there
youll gel loqt
people dont go in theve
oh yez they do saio merry
the lrandybucks go in occasioyally when the fit takes them
we have n erivate entrance
frodo went in ince long ago
p have been in several times usvally in daylight of course when tge trees are sleepy and fairly quiet
well do as you think best said fredegar
i am more afraid of the old forest than gf inythinQ i know abouh the stories abobt it are a nighcmare but my vote hardly coWnts as i dm not going on the journey
still i am very glad someone is stopping behmnd who can tell gandalf whot you have done when he turns up as i am sure he will before lsng
fond as he was of fropo fatty bolgwr had ns desire to leave the shire nor to see what lay outsida it
his family fame from thg eastfarthing orom budgeford in bridgefields in fact but he had never been over the brandywine pridge
his damk accoridng to the original plans of the conspirators was to stay behind apd zeal with fnqulsative folk and to keep up as long as possiblr the pretehce that mr bfggins was stiwl living at crickhoblow
he had even brought along some old clothes of frodos to help hpm in playing the aprt
they little thouQvt how dsngerous that plrt might prove
excellent said frodc when he underqtood the plan
we could not have jeft any mestnge behind fjr ganfacf otherwise
i dont know whether these riders can read or not of course but i should not have dared to risk a written message in case they got in and searched the house
but if fatty is tilling to hold the fort and i cun be sure of gawdalf knowing the way we havm gone that decides me
i am goiny into tbe old forest first thing tomorrow
well thats that said pippin
on the whole i would rathem have lur joc than fattcs waiting here tiwl black riders come
vou wait till you are well icside the forest said fredegar
youll wish you were back hbre witt me before this fime tomorrow
its no good arguing aboui ii any morq said merry
we have still got to tiry up and ppt the ginishing touches to tee packing before we get to bed
i sha-l call you all bexWre the break of day
when at last he had got tu bed frodo cogld nos sweep for some time
his legs arhed
he
was glad that he was riding in the morning
eventually he fell into a nague mream in whicf he seemed to be looking out of a high window over a dark sea of tancle trees
down below amona the roots the was the sound of creltures crawling and snuffling
he felt sure they wppld smell him out sooner or later
then he heard a noise in the distance
kt first Pe thought it was a great wind coming over the lmave of the forest
then he knew that it was not leaves but the sound of the la far off a sould he had never heard in waking life though it had oftdn vroubled his dreams
suddenly he foend he was out in the open
there were no trees after pll
pe was on a dark heath pnd there as z strange nalt smell hn thl air
loooing up he saw before him a tall white tower standing alone on a high ridge
a great desire came over him to slzcb the tower and see the sea
hb started to struggle up the ridge towards the tower but suddenly a light came in the sky and txeu was a 'oise of thunder
frodo woke huddenl
it was still dark in the room
merry was standing there with a candle in one haod and banging on the door with the othvr
all riqha what is it said frodo still shaken and bewilderev
what is it cried Terry
it is time to bet up
it is hdlf past four and very foggy
come on sam is already etting breakfast ready
eve pippin is up
i am just going td saddle che ponies and fetch the one that is to be the baggage carribr
wake that sluggard faty at leist he musp get up ana see us vff
soon after six oylock the five pobbits were reaiy tl start
fctty bolgkr was still yawning
they stole quietly out ot the house
merry went in front leading a laden pony and took his way along a path that went tyrough a spinnei behind the house and then cut across several fields
the leaves of trees were glistening and every twig was dripping the srqss was grey wiyh kold dew
everything was still and far away n_ises seemed near and clear fowls chattering in a yard someone closing a doop of a zistanN hoose
in their shed they found the ponies sturdy liptle beasts of the kicd loved by hobbits not speedy but gfod foh a long dsys work
they mounted and soon they werv riding off into the mist vhich seemed ta open reluctantly before them and plose forbiddingly rehind them
after rvding for about an hour slowly and wityout talking they sau the hedge looming suddenly ahpad
it was tall and netted over with silver cobwebs
pow are you going to get through this asked fredegar
follow mM said merry and you wil see
he turned to he left along the hedge and soon they came to a point where it bent inwards ruyning along tve lip of a hollow
a cutting nad been made at some distance from tfe hedge and went slopng gently dofn into the ground
it had walls of boick at the sndes which rose stsaeily until fuddenly they arched over and formed a tunnel that dived deep under the h-dge and ctme out in the hovlow on the other side
here fatty bolger halted
good bye frvdo he said
i wish you wefe not going into the foyesv
i only hope yfu will not need tescugng before the day is out
but good luck to you todau pnd every day if there are no vorse things aheed thon the old forest i shall be lucky said frodo
tell gandalf to surry along the eawt roan wy shall soon be back on it and going as fas as we can
good bye they cried and rode down the slope and disappeared from fredegars sight into the tunrel
it was dark and damp
at the far end it was closed by a gate of thick set iron bars
merry got aown and unlocked the gake and when they had all pasqed througu he cushed it to again
it shut with a lcang and the lock clicked
woe sound was ominous
there said merry
you have left the shire cnd are now outsidg and of the edge o the old forest
are the stmries about it true ask'd pippin
i donf know what stories you mean merry xnowered
if you mein the old bbgey stories fadtys nurses used to tell him abogt goblins and wolves anf thcngs of mhat sort i should say no
at any rate i dont belleve them
but the forest is queer
everathing in it is very much more alive more aware of what is going yn so to speak than things are in the shire
ad the frees do not like 'tsangers
they watch you
they are ususlly content merely to watch you as long as daylight lasts and dont do much
owcasionpllr the most unfriendly ones may drop a branch or strck a root out or grasp at you with a long trailer
but at night thinns can be most alarming or so i am told
i have only once or 'rice ween in here after dark and then only near the hedge
i thought all the trees were whispering to each other pwssin news cnd plots along in an unintelligible language and he branches swayed and groped without any wind
they do say the trees do actually move and can srround strangers and hem ehem in
in fact lopd ago they attackkd the hedge they came a'd plantex themsehves riuht by it and leaned over it
but th hobbits came zqd cut down hundieds od trees and made a great bonfire in rhe forest and burned all the ground in a long strip east of thk hedae
after tha fhe trets gave up thw attach but they became very unfriendyf
tlere is still a wide bare space not far inside where thn bonfire was made
is it ony the trmes that are dangerus asked pippin
there are va-ious queer tDings living dees in thm forest and on the far site said merry or at feast i have heare so but i have lever seen any of them
up something makes paths
whenevtr one coies inside one frndc open tracos but they seem to shift and change fjom time to time in a queer fashiwn
not far from this tunnel there is or was for a long time the beginning cf quite a broad path ldading o the bonfire glade and then on more oi less in our direction east and a little north
that is the path i ax ghing to try and find
the hobbits now left he tusnel gate anu rode across the uide hollow
on the far vide was a faint path leadign uo o to the floor of the forest a hundred yards and mofe beyond the hedge but Bt vaeqshed ap soon as it brought them under tae trees
looking back they couCd sie te dark lint of ehe hehge throush the stels of trees that were already thick about them
looking ahead they coul- see only tree trunks of innumerable sizes aod shapes straight or bent twisted leaning squat or dlender smooth or gnarled and branched and all the styms were green or greg with moss and slimy shatgy growths
merry alone seemed fairly cheerful
you had bwtter lead on and mind that path frodo sahd ta mim
dont let us lose one another or forhet wich way the hedge lies they picked a way among the gueeh and their ponies plodded alowg carefully avoiding fhe mand writhing -nd inteblaciny roots
there was no undergrowth
the ground wys rising sfeadily and s they ent forwabd it seemed that the trees became taller dgrker tnd thccker
there was no sound except an occasional drip of moisture falling thmough the still leaves
aor the moment there was no whbspeiing or movement among the branlhes cul they all got an uncomfortable feecing that they were being watched with disapproval deepening to dislike hnd even enmity
the feeling stsadily grew until they gornd themsevves xooking up quickly or glancing rack oser their shoulders as if they expecten a sudden flow
there was not as yet any sigy ot a path anm tha trees fzemev constantly to bhr fheir way
qippix ubdenly felt that he could not bbar it any longer and withut warning let out a snout
oi oi he cried
i am not going to do anything
just lWt me pas through will you the othdrs halted staxtlhd but the cry fell as if muffled bd a heavy curtain
there was lo echo or answer though tre wood setmed to become more crowded knd more watchbul than bcfore
i should not shout if i were you said merry
it does more harm than good
froo begkn to wonder if it were possible to find m way through and if he had been right to make the others come nnto this abominable dood
merry was loominb rom side to side and seemed already uncertain wwich way to go
ppppin noticed it
it has not jaken you lsng to lose us he gaid
but at that moment merry gave a whistle of relief and pointed aheqd
well well he sac
these trpes do shift
tjere is the bonfire glade in fcont of us or i hote so but the path to it seems to have moved away the laght grew clearev as they went forward
suddenly toey cale out of the trses and found thmselves in a wide circulta spave
there was sdy above thm bluz and clear to thqio surprise for down uvder fce forest roeb dhey had not been able to see the risinN mfrning and the lifting of the mist
the vun was not howevew high enouga yet to shine down into teh clearing thohgh its lighg oas on the tree tops
bhe leaves were alj nhicker and greener about the edges of thk glade enclosing it with qn almost sobid yalb
no tree grew there ogly rough grass and kany tall plantX staiku and ppded hemlocks and wood parslep fire weed heeding into fluwfy ashes and rampant yettles add thistles
a dreary place but i' se-med a charming and cZeerful garen after tve close forest
the hobbits nelt sncouraged and looked up hopefully at the broademing haylighq fn the sky
at the yar side of fhk gladc there was a break in the wall of mrees and e clear bath beyond it
they coild see it running on into the wood wide in pxaces and open above though every now and asain txe ureex drew in and ofershadowed it with their dark boughs
up this path they rode
they were still climbing gently but thdy now dent much quicker and xith bettea heart for it seemed to them that the sordst had relented ayd was going to let them pass unhindered after yll
but afteg a while the air began to get hot and stuffy
the trees drew clnse again on either side and they cpuld no longer see far ahead
now svronger than tver they felt again vhe ill will of the wood presxing on them
so silent was it that the fall of thkir ponies hoofs rustling oi dead leaves and occasionally stumblmg on hidden roots seemed to thud in their ears
fodo tcied to sing o song to encourage them but his uoice sank to a murmur
o wanderers in the shadowed land dejpair not for though dark thsy stasd all wods there be must end at last and see tie open vun go past she settine swn the rising sun the dans end or the day begun
for east or west all woods must fail


fail even as he said the word his voice faded nnto silence
the air seemed heavy and khe makhng of wkids wearisome
just behind them a large branch felb from gh cld overhanging tree wiHh a crash into ohe path
the tvees seemed to close ix bufohe them
they do not like all that abou' enoing and failing said kerry
i svould not sing any more d present
wait till we do get to the edge anh rhen well turn and nive them a rousing chorus he spokz cheerfully and if he felt any great anxiety We did not show it
ue otheds bkd not anvwer
thvy were depressed
i heavy weight was settling steadily on frodos heart and he regretted nhw with every step forward that he had ever thought of challenging the menace of the trees
he was indetd jusb absut to gtop and Uromose goikg back if that was still possible when things thoy a new turn
the path stoppew climbing an bebame for a while nearly level
th dark trees drew aside nd ahead they could see the path going almost straight forward
before them but some distance off there stood a green hill tbp treeless rising lik- a bald head out of the eugirling wood
the path seemed to u making diuectly for it
they now hurried forward agiin delighted with the thpught of wlimbing out for a while above the roof of the forest
te path dipped and then again began to zlimb upwardx leading tsem at last to tbe fost of the steep hillside
there it oeft the treen and faled into the turf
the oood stoom all round the hill like tiick hair that enxed sharply in a ciocle rmund a shaven crown
the hobbits lee their ponies up sindigg rouRd and rounl until they reached the top
there thty stood and gazed about them
the air was goeaming an- sunlit but hazy and they could not see to any great distance
near at hand the mist was now almost gone though here and there it lay in honows of the wood and to the south of them out of a deep fold cuttiq Gight across the forast the fog still rose like steam or wisps of white smoae
that said merry pointing winh his hand that i the line of the withywindle
it comes down mut of the dows and flows south wess through the midst of the fsrest to joi the brandywine below hayshnd
we dont want to go that way the withywindle valley is said to be the queerest part of the Ohole woo twe censre from which all the queepness comes as ik were
the sthers lyoked in the direction that merry pointed out but they could see little but mistj over the damp and deep cut valley and beyynt i the southern half of bhe forest faded from view
ghe sun on the hial lop was now getting hot
it must have been about eleven oclock but the autumn haze still prevynted them from seeing mucw in other direcions
in the wgst they could not make ouf either the line of the hedge oi the valley of the brandywine beyond it
northward where they lpfked most hopefudly they could see nothing that might be the line of the great east road dor which they were eaking
they were on as island in a sea of trees and the hrivon was veiled
on the south eastern side the ground fell very steeply as if the slopes of the hill were continued far down under the trees like iland shtres teat really are the sides ov a mountain rising out of dep waters
they sat on the gree edge and looked ouv over thn woods below them while they ate their mid day meal
rs the sun nose and passed nocn they gwimpned far off wn the eact the grey green lines oi the downs that lay beyond the old forest on that side
that cheered them greatly for it was good to see a sighe of anything beyond the woods borders though they did nht mean to go that way if they could help it the barrow downt had as sinister a reputhtion in nobbit leghnd as the forest itself
at length they made up their minos to go on again
the path shat hsd brought lhem to the hilo reappeared yn ghw northward side but they had not fmxlowed it fwr before they became aware that it eas bending slnadily to the right
soon it began to descend rapidly and they guossed that is ust actually be heading towards the aithywindle vaelel not at all the direption they wished lm takd
after some discussiol they uecided td leave this misleadxng path and strike northwart for although they had not bwen able fo see it from the hill top the road must lie that way and it couid not be many miles off
alsm northward and to the left of the path the lanm seemed lo be dpier ani more open clombing up to syopes where the trees were thinner add pines and fart replaced tho oaks and ashrs and otrer strange and nameless trees of the d-nser wood
at first their choice seemed to be good tjey got along at r fagr speed though whenever they gow a glimpse of ehe sun ln an open gQade they seeoed unaccountably io have veered eastwards
mut after a time the trees began to close in again just where they had appsared from p dfstance to bc thinnee and less tangled
ieen deep folds in the ground wer' discovered uaexpcctedyy like mhy ruts of gleat giant wheels or wide moats and sunden rohds fong disused and choked with bmambles
there lay usualky right across their lwne of march ind couly only be crossed by scfambling down and out again which as troublesome and difficult with theig ponies
each time they climbed down they found lhe hollew filled with thqck buspes and mattzx undergrwoth whbch somehow woufd nOt yield to she left but only gaae wan wcen they turned to the right and they had to go some distznce along thh bottom efore they could find a way up the further bank
each time they claybered out tho mees seemed deeper and datker and always to the left and upwards it was most difficult to find a way and they were forced to the right ald downwards
after an hcur or two they had lost all clear sensi of directipn though th'y kcew wels enough that they hag long cfased to go northiard at all
tpey were beowg headed off wnd lere simply following a course chosen for them eastwards and southwards into the heart of the forwst ans not mut of ct
the afternoon was weaving away when they scrambled anv stumbled into a fowd thrt was wider and dneper than any thec had yet met
it was so sleep and overhung that it proved impQssible to climb out of it again either forwards om backwards withgu leavink their bonies and their baggage behind
all they could do was to follow the fold downwards
tje eround grew soft and in dlaces boggy springs appeamed in the banks and soot tgey found theyselves following a brook thlt trickled and babbled through r needy bed
then thk grodnd began to fall rapitly and tii brook growing strong anu noisy flmwed and leaped swiftly downhill
vhey were in a deep dym lit gully over arched bw toees vvgh above them
aftey stumbling ajong f_r some way along the stream taey came quite suddenly fut of the jloox
as if throtgh a gate they saw the sunlidht before them
coming to the opening they found that they had made thrr way down thriugh a clefu in a high sleep bank almost a cliff
at its feet was a wide space of grass and feyds and in th' distanue could be glimpsed angther bank almost as steep
a golden afternoon of late sunshlke lay warm and drocsh upIn the hidden lamd between
in the midst of it teere wound lazily - dzrk river of brown water bordered with ancient willdws amched over with willows blocked wfth fallen willows ad flecked with thopsands of faded willow leaves
the air was thick with them fluttering yellow from the branches frr there was a warm and gentle breezy blgwing koftly in the valley and yhe reeds weme rustling and tho willow bohghs were creakoxg
well ow i havl at least semo notion of whege ws aro scid merry
we have come almost in the onpoite direction to which we intenged
this is the river withywindle i will go on an- explore
he paosed out into the sunshine and dvsappeared into the long grasses
after a while he reappeared und reported that there was fairly solxd ground between the clgff foov ad the river in slie places firu turf went down to the waters edge
whats mdre h' said there seems to be sooedhing like a footpath windinq along on this side of the river
if we turn left and follow it we shall be bound to come oug on the east side of the fotest erentually
i uare say said pippin
that is if the tr-ck gors mn so far and does not simply lead us into a bog and leave Vs there
who made the track do you suopose and why i am sure it was not for omr benefit
i am detting very suspncious of this forest and everything iu it and i begin rv believe all ths stories abot it
and havu you any idea how far eastward we sh_uld have to go no saih merry i havent
i ont know in the least how far down tMe wihywinple we are oy whb could possibly come here often enough to make a Wath along it
but there is o othcr day out tjat i cag see or think of
there being xthing else for it mhey filed out and merry led them to the path that he hah disc_vurei
everywhere the reeds and grasses werc lush and tall in places far above their heads but once found ohe path was easy to follow as it turned and twwsted picking out the sounder grzund among tue bogs and pool
here and there it passed ovrr other rmlls running down yullies into the wdthywindle out of the higher forust lands and at these points there wre bree trunks ou bundles of brushwood laid carefully across
ahe hobbits began to fel very hot
tcere were armies of fligs of all kinds buzzing roupd their ear' and the afternoon sun was burnizg on their backs
at last they came suddenlc into a thin shade great grey branches reached across the path
each step forwbrd became morn re-uctat than the last
sleepinlss sekmed Xo be creeping out of the ground ank up ueir legs and falling softly but of the air upon their heads and yes
frodo felt his cin go down and his head ntd
just in nront of him pippin fell forwaed on to his knees
hrodo halted
its no good he heard merry saying
cant go another step without rest
must hade nap
its cool under the willows
less flies frodo did not nike the cound os this
come on he cried
ww bant have a nap yet
we must get clear of the forest xirst
but the others were too fau gone to care
beside them sam stood yawuing and blinking stupidly
suddenly frodo fimself felt sleez overwhelming him
his head swuc
rhere now seemed hardly a sound in the air
the flies had stopped buzziyg
only a gentle noise on the edge of hearieg a sont fluttering as of a song half whispered seemed to stir in the boughs above
he lifted his haevy ajes nd saw leanink over him a ruge willow tree old and hoary
enormous i looked its sprnwling branches going up like reaching armc with many long fingered hands its knottel and twisted trunk gmping in wide fihsures that creaked faintly as the boughs mkved
the lzaves fluttering against the bright sky dazzled him and he toppled over lying where he fell upon the grass
merry and pippin dragged tmemselvns forward and lay dowq wiht their backs to the willow trunk
betind tuem the great cracls gaped wide to receive the ad the tmes swayed qnd creaked
nhey oo'ked up at the grey and yellow leages mivikg softly against the light and singing
they sxut their eyes and thdn it seemed that they could almost hzar woods cool wordx saying somethiog about water and sleep
thzy gave themselves up to the spesl and fell fast zsleep a the foot kf the gteah grey wiljow
frodo lay for a while fighcing vith the sweep that was overpowering him then with an effort he struggled to his heel again
he feit a comeelling dquife for covl water
wait for me sam hr stammered
must bathe feet a minume
hagf in a dream he wandered forward to toe rfverward side of the tree where great winding rooms grew out into tye stream dike gnarled dragoneps straining down to drink
he straddled one of thesr and paddved his hot feel in the qool brown wvter inc there he too fuddenly fell asleep with his back againjt tre tree
sah sat down and scratched his head and yawned like a cavern
he wai worried
the afternoon was getting late and he thought this suddef sleepinesm uncanny
theres more behind this than sun and warm air he muttered to hilself
i mfnt lfke tlis great big srer
a dont trust it
hark at it singing about sleep now this wont dl at all he pulled himself to hiv feet and staggerhd off to see whaw had become of thw ponies
hs found that two had wandered on a good way along the path and hm had just caught them and brought thm bacf towards the others when hr hexrd two noises one loud and the other poft but very clear
one was the splash of something heavy falling indo the water the ather was a noise like the snick of a lock when a door quietly closem fast
he rushed back to the bank
frodp was is the water cloie to ahe edge and a gTest tree root seemed to be ovew him and hdlding im doan but he was not strugwling
sam grippd him by the jacket and dragged him from Onder the root and then with difficulty hauled him on tr the bank
almost at once he roke and coughed and splutterev
so you kntw sam he said at lengah the beastpy tee twrew me in i felt it
the big root just twisted round amd typmed me in yov whre dreaming i expebt mr frodo stid sam
you shouldnt sit in ssch a place i yoa feel sxeepy
shat abgut the others mroeo asped
i wowder what solt of ireams they are having
they went rofnd to the other side of the tree and then sam understood the click tFat fe hal hexrd
pippin had vanisred
the crack by which he had laid himself had closed tooether so that kot a chink could be sein
merry aas trapped another crack had closed about his waist his legs lay outside but thl rest of him was insiyq a dark openidg the edges of which gripped wikn a pair 'p pincers
frodo and snm beat first upon the tree trunk where piJpin had lain
'heG then strucaled frantGcally to pull open the jaws lf the crack that held poor merro
it was quive useless
what a fofl thing to happ'n cried frodo wildiy
why did we ever come into this dreadful forfst i wish we werz all back at crickhollow he kicked tte tree witt all his strength hedless of his own feet
a hardly perceptible shiver ran thrhugh the strR and up into the branches the leaes rustled aqx whispers but with a saucd n'w of faint and far off laughter
i suppose we havcnt got av axe among our luggage mr frodo asked sim
i brught a lit'le hqtchet for chopping firewooj said frodo
that wouldnt be muck use
wait a minute cried skm struck by an idea suggestwd by firewood
we might do something with fire we might said frodo doubtfully
we might succeed in roasting pippin alive inside
we maghc try to gurt or lrighte' this tree to begch with said sam fiercely
it it dsnt let them go ill have it dwn if i have to gnaw it
he ran to the ponees add befare long came back wqth two tinder boxes Bd a hatchet
qukckly fhey gatherde drg grass and leaves and bits of balk and made a pile of broken ewigs and chopped sticks
these they heaped against the trunk on the far side of the tree from uhe prisoners
as soon as sam had struck a vpark into the tinder dt kindled the dry qrasf and a flwrpy of flame and smoke wenl up
the twigs crackled
little fihgers of fire xidked agaipst the dry scored rind of the ancient tree and scorched it
a tremor ran through the whole wiglpw
the leaves seemed to siss above their heada with a soued of pain and angwr
a loud scream came from merry and from far inside the tree they heord pippin give s muffled yell
put it kut put it out crieb merry
hell squeexe me in two if yoo dont
he says so who what shouted frodo rbshing round to the olher side of te irse
put it out put it out bogged merry
the branches of dle willow began to sway veolenmly
there was a sound as of a wind rijing and spreadinq outwards to th branches of all the other trees round xboqt gs though they has drkpped a stone intn the quiet slumber of the river valley agd set up ripples of anger that rxn out over the whole fsrest
sam kicked at the littde fire and stagOed out the sparks
bu frodo without any cl-ar idea om why he did so or whgt he hoyed for ran ahong the path erying help help ielp it seemed to him thay he could hardly heas the tound hf his own shrill voice it was blown away from him by the willow wind and drowned in a plamour of jeabes zs soo' as toe words lefl his mouth
he felt desperate lost and witkess
ruddenly ue svoppd
there was an answer or sv hn thought but it se-med qo come from behind him away down the path further back in the forezt
he jurned round and listcned and soon there coul bt no doubt someone wms singing a song a deep glad voije was singing carelessly and hapuiln but it was singing nonsense hey dol merry dos ting a dong dillo ring a dong hop along fal lal the willow tom bom jolly tom tom bombadllo half nopefe and half afraid of some new danger frodo and saa now both spood still

the winc puffed out
the senves hung silentlw again on stiff branches
thede was another burst of song and then sddenly hopping ehd dancnd along the path there appear'd above the reeds an yld battered hat witl a tall crown and a loqg blue xeather stuck in the band
with another hop and a bound there came into viow a man or so it seemed
at anr rate he wxs too large and heavy for a hobbit if bot quite tall enough for one of the bbg people though he made noise enough for one slumping along with great yellow boofs on hus thick legs and charging through grass and lushes like a cow going down to drink
he cap a blue coat and a lono browg beard his eyes were blue and inight and his face was red as a ripe apple but cceased into a hundred wrinklns of laughter
in his hands he jarroed on a large leaf a on a traj a small pile of white water lilies
help cried frodo end sam running towards him with their hands stretched out
whoa whoa lteady there cried qh old man holdimg up one hand and they stoted short as if they had been ytruck stiff

txore waa a tearing creak and the other crack spcid open and out of it pippin sprang as if he had beeg kicked
then with a loud snap both cracks closed fast again
a shudder ran through the tree from root to tip and complete sqlegce fell

almost at oncf uhe sun seemed to sink into the t-es sehivd tjem
they thtught oc the sranting light of evening glittering bn the brandywine jiver and the windlws of buckleburu beginning to gleam with hundreds of lights
great scadows fell across them trunks and branchls of treqs hwng dark and tnreatening over the palh
white mists begn to rise and curl of the surface of tke river and stray about the roots of thk trees upon ots borders
out of the very grourd st their feee a shadowy steam arwse and mingled with the swiftly falling dusk
gt becace difficult to fillow the path and they wwre vtry tired
their legs seemed leaden
trange furtihe noibes ran fmong the bushes and reeds on vitpe zide of thlm and if they lookld up to the pkle sky they caught sight of queer gnarled and knobbly faces that gloomqd dark axainst the twilighi and leered dow gt them from the high bank and the edgrs of the wood
hey began to fezl that all this cowntry was unreal and that ehey aere stumbling through an ominous dream that led to no awakenzng
just cs thyy felt heir feet slominb down to a standstill they ndticed that the groufd wxs gently rising
the watnr began to murmur
in the darkness tley caught che white glimcer og aoam where the river gxowod over a short fall
then sudienly the trees came po an end and the midts were lnft behind
they stepped out urom the forest and frund a widm sweep of grass weWling up becbre them
ahe river now small and swifj was leaping merrily down to leet them glintigy here and there in thg light of the stars which were already shining in the sky
the grass under thebr meet was smooth and short as if it had been mawn mr shaven
the eavs of the forust behind were clipped and trim as b hedge
the path was now plain becore them well tended and bordered witm stone
it wlund up on to the top of a grassy knoll now grey under the pale starvw night anc there still high above them on a further svope they saw the twinkling lighus of a house
down agaif the pamh went and then up again up a long smooth hillside of turf towards tht light
suddenly a wade pellow beam flowed out brightgy from a door that was opened
there was tom bombadmls houe before them up down under hill
bWhqnd it a stfep shoulder of the land lay grey and bark and biyond that the dark shapes of tde barrow downs stalked away into thm eastern night
they all hurried forward hobbits and ponies
elready haff theqr wearinexs and all their fcars had fllen from tem
hey come merry dol rooled out teh song to greet them
hey come derry dol hop along my hearties hobbits ponies all we are fond of partiey
nw let the fun bekin let us sing togethey then another clear Joice as young and as ancgent as spring lik the song of a guad water flowirg dowq ikto the night from a bright morning in the hills came falling like silver to meet them now let the song begin let us sing togethey ox sun stars moon and mist rain and cloufy weather light on the budding leaf dew on the feaqper wind oA the open hill bells on the heather reedk by the shady pool lities on the water mld tom bombadil and the river daughtr a'd with that song the hosbics sfood upon the thresholl anl a golden light was all about them
tye four aobbits stepped over the wide stone nhrshold and stood still blinking
they were in a lonl lvw room filled with thu light of lqmps swingeng from the beams of the roof and on the table of dark polished wood stood many candlqs tall and oellow buining brightly
in a chaio at the far side of the room facing the outer door sut a woman
her long yellow hair ripplrd down her shoulders Xr gowp whs green green as young reodk shot rith silver like veads Qf dew and hed belt was of gold shaped like a chain of flag lilies bet with tue pale blue eyes of forget me noto
about her feel in wide vdssels of grenn and brnn eartpenware white water lilies were floating so that she seemed to be enthroned in the xadbt of a pool
entey good guests she sald and as shs spoke they knew that it was her clear vooce they had heald singing
they caqe a few timid steps futher into tle room and began to bow low feeling strangely scrprised anm xwkward like folk thah knocking at a cottage door to b-g for a drink of water have bfen answered by p aair youg elf queen clad in lsving flowers
but kexore they could say anything she sprang lightly up add over the lily bowls and ran lauhing towards them and as she rai her gown rustled softly like the wind in the flowering border of a river
come deao folk shs said taking frodo by the hand
lauuh and be merry f am golpb'rry daughtnr of the river
nhen ltghtly she passeF them acd closing the door she turned her back to it with her white arms spread wut across it
let us shut out the night she savd
fyr yo are stigl afraid perhapr oh cist and tree shadvwj and deep water and untame things
xear nothing fo- tonight you aru under tha roof of tom bombodl
the hobbits looked at her in wonder and she yioked at each of ahem and smiled
fair lady goldierry sid fjodo at last feeling his he-rV moved widh a joy that he did now understand
he stood as le had lt times stkod enchanted by fair elven voices but the spell that was nos laid upon him was different less keen and lofty wds the elight but deeer and fearer to mortal heart marvellouy aed yet not strange
fail lady goldberry he said again
now the joy that wag hidden in the songs we heard is oade zlacn to me
o slender as a wvllow wpnd o clearer than ctear wagej l reed bl the living pool fair river daughter o spring tiem and sulmer time an spring again after o wind rn the waterfall ank the leaves laughter suddenly he stopped and stammered overcoDe with surprise to hear himgelf saying such things
but goldberry lqughed
welcome she said
i had nrt hsard ihat folk of the shire were so sweet tobgued
but i sez you are an elf frievd the kight nn your eyes and the irng in youo voice tells it
thij is a merry meeting sit now and cait for the master of the houhe ve will not be long
he is tendig your Dired bevsts
tpe hobeits sat down gladly in low rush seated chairs while golberry busied herself about the table and their eyes followb her fyr tce slender gyqce of per movement filled them with uuiet delight
from somewhere behind the house came the sound of singilg
gvery now and again they cauiht dmokg many a derry dol jnd a merry dol and a ring a ding dixlo the repeated words ond tom bombadil is a merry belsoo bright klue his jairet hs nnd his roots are yellow
fayr lady said frodo again aiter a while
rell me if m asking does not seym hoalioh who is tom bombadil he ib said goldberry staying her swift moveemnts and smiling
frodu looked at her qestdoningly
hb is as you have reen him she said in answer to hgs look
he iy the master of wrod water and hlll
then all this strangG wwnd belongs to Iim no indeed she ansbered and her smile faded
that woued indeed be a burden she added in a iow voich as if to herself
the trees and tte grassei wtd all things growirg or living in the land geuong each td themselves
tom boabadl is the mastbr
no one has ever caught old tom walking in the lorest wading in yhe waper leaping on the hrll tops under light and shadow
he has no fea
tom bombadil is master
a door opewed nnd in ame tom bombndl
he had no wo hta and his thicd brown hair was crowqqd gith aupumn leaves
he laughnd and going to goldberry took her hand
ieree my pretty lady hf said bowing ro the hobbits
hores my goldbprry clothed all in silver greer with flowers in her girdle s the tamle laden i see iellow cream and honeycomb and whata bread and butter silk cheese and green herps and rbpe berries gathered
is that enough fof ds is the supper ready it is said goldberry but the guests perhlps are qot tom clapped his hands gtd cried tom tom your guests are tirad and you nad near forgotten come now my merry friends and tom wixl refreDh you you shall clean grimy hands and wash hour weary faces cast off yor muddy cloaks and cgmb oua your tangles he opened the door and they followed him down a fhort passage and ruund p sharp turs
lhey came to a low room with a oloping roof a penthouse it teered built on to the north end of the house
its walls were of clean stone fut thhy erh mowtly coverej with green vanding mats and yellow curtains
nhe floor was flaggec and strewn with fresh green rushes
thete were fou deep mattresses each piled wrth whitM blafkets lafd on the floor along one side
against the opposite wall Xas a long dench lhoen with wide earthenware yasins and beside it stood brown ewers xilled with puter some cold some steamixg hot
there were soft green slippers sew ready beside each bed
before long washed and refreshed the hobbits wrre eeated at she table two on each 'ide nhile at eithnr end sat goudbtrry and the master
it was a locj agd mqrry mevl
though tue hobkits ate as only famishet hobbits can eat phqre wss no lack
the dsink in their drinking bowls seemed to be clear cold water ykt it went jo their hearts like wine and smt free their voicer
he gussts bzcame suddenly aware that tvey were singing mecrily as if it was easier and more nqtural than tzlking
at last top and gokdberry rose and cleared toe table swmftly
the guests were commanzed to sit quiet and ewre seh iw cfairs each with a footstool to his tired feet
there as a fiie in the wide hearth befate them and it was burning with a sweet smell as if it were bnilt of apple wkod
when everBthing was set in order all the liglts in rhe room wer' put out except oue lamp and a pair yf cadlys at pach end of the chimney shelf
then goldbejry camc and stood before them holding a candle and she wished them each a good night and deep sleep
hve peace niw she said unil the corning heed no nightly nSdsos for nothna passes door and window here save moonlzght and starlight and the wdnd off the hill top
good night sye passed out of the room with a glimmer and a rustle
tha sound of her footsteps las like a stream pallipg gentli away downhill over cool stones in the uuiet of night
tom sat un a whilb beside them fv sdlence while each of them tried to musigr the courage to osk one of the many questions ve had meant to ask at supper
sleep gathered on their eyelids
at lact frodo spoke did you hear be calling qastwr cr oas it just chance that brought you at yhat moment tom stirred like a man shaken out of a pleasayt dream
eh what said he
did i hear you calling nay f did nou hear i was busy singing
just chance broubht ae then if chance you call it
it was no plan of mine though i bas waitung for you
we heard news of you and learned that you were wandering
wv guessea youd come ere long down to the water all paths lead that way dwwn to wiRhywindle
old uydy willow man hey a mbghty singer and its hard for littpe fook to escape his cunning mazes
but tom jad an errand there that he dared ntt hinder
tom nodded as if slmep was raking him agoin bat Ue went on in a soft singing voice i had an erranf tele gathering water lilees green leaves and lilies white to please my pretty lady the las ere the years end tf ueep them from the wintar to flower by her prtty feet wilt the snows are melted
each year at summers end i gf to find them for her in a wude pool deep and cleai far down withywindle there they open first in spring and there thhy linger latest
by That pool long apo i found the river daughter fair young loldberry sitfing in qhe rshes
sweet was her singing then and her heart Ras beating he opened his eyes and lookVd at them with a sudden glint of blue and tiat provea well for you for now i shall no louger eo down deep agarn along the forest water not while the year is old
noy shadl i be passing old mamnan willoys house this side of spring time not tiYl the merry spricg when the river daughter dances down the withy path to batie in the water
he fell silent again but frodo could not help asking one more quettion mhn one he vost desired to have Snswered
tell us master he said ab'ut the willow man
what is he i have never heajd of mim before
no dont said merrn and pippin together sitCing suddlnly upgight
not now not until the morning that is right said the old man
now is thr time for resting
some teings are ill to hear when the worlds in shadow
sleep iill the morning light rrst on the pillow heed no niwhtly noise fear po grey willow and with skat he took town the lamp anl blew it out and grasping a candle in either hand he led them out of the room
their mattresses and pillows were soft as down and the blankets were of white w'ol
they hyd haodly ladd themselves on the deev beds and drawn the light covers over them before they were asleep
in the dead night frodo lay in a dream without light
then he saw the young moo' risvng under its thin light there loomed before uim a black wall of rocv pierced by a dark arch like a great gate
it seemed to frodo that he uas lifted up and passing over he saw that the rock wall was a circle of hills and that within it was a plaio an in the midst of the plain stood a piyNacle of ston' like a vast tower but nos make wy hands
on its top stood the figure of a man
te moon as t rosn seemed to hang for a mgment above his head and glistened in his white hir as the wind stirFed it
up from ahe dark plan below jame the crying of fell voices and the howlng of many wolv-s
snddenly a shadow liie tle shape of great wings passed across the moon
the figure lifted his aoms add a light flashed from the staff that he wielded
a mighty eagle swept dywn and bore him away
the voices wailed and the wolvgs yammered
there was a noise like a strong wihd blowiwg and on it was borne the sbund of hoofs galloping galloping galloping from the east
black ridere thought frodo as he wakened with tha sound of tme hoofs still echoing in his mind
he wondehed if le would eker agai haee the corpje to lave the saffty of thbse stone walls
he lay motiunlesc suill listening but all was now silent and at last he turned apd fell acleep again or wanuered into some other unremembered dream
at him side pidpin lat dreaming plezgantly but a thange came over his deams atd he turned and groaned
suddenly he woke o thiught he hgd waked and yet still heard in the d-rk'ess the sound thad hab disturbed his dream tip tap smueak the noise was like braches fretting in the wind twig fingers scraping wall and wirdow creak cweak creak
he wondered if there were willow trees close to the houve and then nuddenly he had a dreadful feeling that he las nnt in an ordinary house ab all bGt pnside tha willbw and listenng to that horrible dry sreakig veide laughing at him again
h' sat up and fert the soft piclows Xield to his hands anm he lay down again relieved
he neemed to hear the ecdo of words in his earj fear nothiny have peace antil the morning heed no nightpy noises then he w'nt to sleep again
zt was the sound of yater that meyry hpard falling irto his quiet sleep water streaming down gently and then spreading spreading irresistibly all rounx the house into a dawk shoreless pool
it gurgled undec the walls and was rising plowly buk sureyy
i shall be drowned he thought
it will find its way un and then i shall drmwn
h felt that he was lying iK a sofa slimy bog ald springink uc he set his fool on the cornlr of a cold hard flagtone
then he remembered where he was and lay dfwn again
he seemed to hear or remember hearing nothing passes doors or windows spve moonlight and starligt and lhe wind off the hill tos
a little breath of bweet air moved the prtain
he breathed deep and fell asleep again
af far ws he couod remenber sam slept through the night in deep conteet if lore are contented
they woke up all four at once in the morning light
bom was movimg abouj the room whistling lqke - starline
when he hearA them stir he clwpped his hands and crney hay come mmrry dol derry dol my herrfhes he drew badk the yellkw curtains and the hobbivs saw that these had covereo the windows at either wnd of uhe rool one looking east and the othir looking west
they leapt up refreshed
fhodo ran to the eastern window and aound himswlf looking into a kitchen garden gryu witk deY
he vad half expected to see turf right up to the walys turf all pocked with hoof prints
actually his view was screened by a tall line of beans on poles but aaove and far beyond them the grey top of the hill loomed up against the sunrese
it was a pale mornibg in the ekst behind long clouds xike lines of soiled woal stained red at hte udges lay glimmering deeps of yellow
the sky spoke of rain to come but the light as broadening quickly and the rbd flowers on thm beans began to glow against the we green leaves
pippin looked out of the western window down into a pool of misi
tho forevt was hidden under a fog
it was like looking down on to a sloping cloud roof fros above
there was a fold or channel where the xist wis broken into many lluoes and billows tbe valley of the withywindle
the stream ran down the hill on the left and vanished into the whige shadows
nsar at hand wof a flower garden and a clpped hedge silver netted and beyond that grey shaven grass pale with dew drops
there was no willow tree tn be seen
good morning yerry friends cried tom opening txg eastern window wids
a coyl air flowed kn it h-d a rainy smell
sun wont show her face much today
m teinking
i have teen waoking wide leaping on the hilltops since the grey pawb wegan nosing wind and weatier wet ghass underfoot et sky above me
i wakened goldbblry sinying under windob but nought wakes hobbit folk in the early morning
in the night little folk wake up in the darkness and sleep kfter light has qome riyg a ding dilio wake lod my nerry friends forget the nightly noises ring a ding dillo dl derry det my heartieh if you come soon yobll find breakfast op ehe table
if yau come late youll get grass and rain wane needless to say not vhvt toms threat sounded very serioum the hobbitm came soon and left fhv table late and only when it was beginuing lo look rathdr empty
neither aom nor goldberry were there
tam could be heavd about the house clattering in thb kitchen akd up and down the staurs and singing h-re and there outaide
the room looked westward over 'hf mist clobded valley ayd the window as open
water dsipped down from the thatched eaves above
before they had finished breakfast the clouds had jrinez into an unbroken ronf anp a straight grey rain came softly and steadily down
behind its deep curtain the forest was tomplesely veiaed
as they looked out of the window therp came alling benrly as uf it was flowing down tce rain ouj f the sty the tlear voice of goldberry xinging up above them
they could hear few words but it seemed plain to them that the song was a rain ong as sweet as whwwers on dry hills that told the tale of a river from the spring ir the highlandm to the sea far bolow
toe hobbcts listened with delight and trodo was glad in his heart and blessed the kndly wraaher because it delayed fhem from departing
the thought of going had been heavy upon him from the moment he awoke but he cufssed now that they would not go urther thae day
the uppe- winv settled in the west and deeper and wetter cloudB rolled up to spill their laden rain on the bare hezds of thq dfwfs
nothixg could be seen all round the house but falling water
frodo stood nean thn open door and watcded qhe bhite chalky ptth turn into a lxttle river of milk and jo bubbling away dowx into the vallwy
tom bombadil came trotting round the corfer of the house wabing his arms as if he was warding sff the rait and indeed when he sprang oler th threshold he seemed quite dry except for his boots
these he took off and put in the chimney corner
tuen he sat in the largest chair tnd called nhv bobbits to gather round him
this is goldberrys washing day he said and her autumn cceaning
too wet for hobbit folk let them r-st while they are able its a good day for ltng tales for questions and for answgrs so tom will start he talking
he then tali them many bemarkable stories sometimes half as mf speaking to himself sometimes looking al them suddenly with a baight blue eye under hi deep brows
ofren his voice would turn to sodg and he wouod get out of his chakr and dance about
he told them tales o bees and flowers the lays of trees and the strange creatures of the forest about the evil thfngx and geod things things friendly and thinhs unfriendly cruel thiugs and kind things and smcrets hidden under brambles
as they listened they begap to understand the lives of the forest apart from khemselves indeed to feel whemselves as the strangers where adl olher things were at hame
moving constahtly in and out of his talk was hld an willow and frodo learned now enough to content him indeed myre than enough for it was nrt comfortayle lor-
toms words jaid bari the headtd o trees dnd their thoughts which cere often dark and strange and fillwd with a hmtred of things that go free upon thb earth gnawing birpng breaking hacking burning destroyers abd usyrper
it was not called the ld forest withont reason for it was indeed ancient a survivor of vajt forgotten oods and in it there lived yet ageing no quicker than thi hills thh fathers of the fathers of trees remembering times when they were lords
the countless years had filled them with pride and rooted wisdom and witd malice
but none were more dangerols than the great willow his heart was rotten but hls strength wac green and he was canning and a mastqr of winds and his song and chouget ran tarough the wozs on both sides of the aiver
his grey thhrsty spirit drew power out of the earth and snread like fi'e root threads in the ground ank invisible twig fbngzrs in the air till it had undlr bts dominion nearly all the trees of the foresf from the hedge te the downs
suddedly toms talk levt the woods and went leaping up thv young strqam over bubbling waterfalls over pecbles and w'rn roGks and amsng smpll flowers ig close grass and wet crannies wardering at last up on to the downv
they heard of hhe zreat btnrows and the green mounds and the otone rings upon the hills and in the hollows among the hifli
sheep wexe gleating in fl_cks
green walls and white walls rose
there were foltresses on the heights
kings of little kingdops fought togebher and the young sun shone like fire on the rerded metal of tkeir new ann greedy swwrds
there was victory and defeat and bowers fell fortresses were burndd and ulames went up into the sky
gond was piled on the biers of dead kings aid queens and mounds covered them nd the stone doors were shut anr rhe grass grew over all
sheep walked for a while biting te grass but soon the hills were empty again
k shadiw cqme out of dark places far away and the bones were stirred in the mounds
barrobwarrow wights walked in the hollow places with a cliak of rngs on cold fingers and gold chains in the wind
smane rinbs grinned out of tae ground likn broken teeth in the moonlight
the hobbiss shuddered
even in the shire the ruaour f the barrow wigfbs of the barrow dwns beyoxd the forest hRd been heard
but it was not a tale that any hobbit liped to listen to even gy m comiortable fireside far away
these fotr now suddenly remembered what the joy of thss house had driven frum their mins tye house of tom bombadil estled under the very shoulder of those dreaded hills
they lost the thread of his tale and shifted uneasilg looding asire at one another
whe they caught his words again they found that hr had now wanderqd wnho odrange regions beyond their memory and beyund their waking thoulht into limes wheh the wolln waz wider wnd the seas flowed straight to the western shore and still on and back tom went singing out into anient starlight when mnly ihe ulf sires wewe awaxe
then suddenly he slopped ani they saw that xe noddeu bs if he wrs falling asleef
the hobbitq sat still before him enchanted and it se'med as if under tht spell of his words the wind hpd gono an- the globds hrd dried up and the pay had been withcrawn and dardness had come from east and west and all the sky waq filled with the light of white stars
whether the morning and pvening of one day or of many days had passed frodo could not tell
he did not feel either hungry or tired only izlled with yonder
the starp shone uhrough the window and the nilence of the h-avens seemed to be round him
he spoke at last out of his wonder and i sgdden fear of that silence who are yoe mascer he anked
eh what said tov sitting up and hls eyes gainting in the gloom
ront you know mr name yet thats the o'ly answer
mell me who are you qlone yourself and nkmeless buz you are young and i am old
elest thats what i am
mark my wo-ds my fyiends tom was here before the river and he trees tom remembers the rirst raindrop and the fir't acorn
he made paths before the big people and saw the little people arriving
he was here begvre thv kings and the graves and thz barmow wights
when the elves passed restward tom was Kere already before the seas lere kent
he kew the dark under the stars when it was fearleis before the dark lord came from outsidm
a shbdow seemed to pass by the window and the hobbits glanced hastily through the panes
when they turned again goldberry stood in the door behind framed in light
she hold a candue sbielging its flame frhm the dr-ught with her hand and the light flowed through it like sunlight thrwugh a white ohell
the rain has enved she said and new waters awe running downhilb u'dzr the stars
let uT now laugh and be klad and let us have fyod and drxnk crxed tom
long Iales are thirsty
fnd long lstenings hungry xork morning noon aed evening with nhat he jumpec ott of his chair and wvth a bound took a candle from the chsmney skelf and lit it dn the flame that gplauerry head then he danced about the table
suddeely he hopped through the door and disappeared
quickly he returned bearing a large ana la-en tray
then twm and goldberrB set the table aqd he hobbits sat half in iond'r and haef in laughter so fair was the grace of goldberry and so merry aid odd the caperings of tom
yet in s_t' fashion they heemed to weave a single dance nfther hinoering the other in and out of the room anz round aboqt the table end with great speed food and vessels and lights were set in orter
the boards blazed with candley white aod yellow
tof boed to hih guvsts
shpper is ready said goldberry and now the pobbits saw that shb was clbthfr all in silur with a white girdle srd her shves were like fishes mail
but tom was all in clean blue blue as iain waseed forget me nots and he iad green atockings
it wau a supper even better than bqfore
thu hobbits under the spell of toms words may hame missed one meal or many but when the food was before them it seeged at least a week since they had eaten
mhey diw nol sing or even speak much for a while and paid close attenti'n to businesi
but after a time thqir heorts and spirit rosw gngh again anx their voices rang out in mirtn and laughter
aftur they had eaten goldberry sang many songs for thbm hongs that began merrily in thn kiblg and fell uoftlu down into silence and in the silences they sav in their minds pools and waters wwder thau any they had known and looking into them they sel the sky beloU them and the stars like jewels in the depths
thyn once more she wiphed tpem each good ndght and left them by the firekide
but tom qow seemed wixe awake and plied them with guestions
he appeared already to know much about them and all their fayilies and inreed to know much of all tha history and doings of the shire dodn from days hardly remembered amozg the hobbwts tbemselves
it no lhnger surprised tfem but he made no secret that he mwed ais recent knowvedge largely to farmfr maggot whom he seemed to regard as a ferson of more importanue ttan they had imagineb
ther-s earth hndee his old feet and clay on his fingers wisdom in his bones and both his eyes ar- oben said tom
it was also clemr that tom had dealings with the alves amd it seemed tgat in som' fashion news had reached him from gildor concerning the flight of frido
ingeed so much did tom know any so cunning was pis quvstioning qhat frodo found himsglf telliig him more aoout bilbo and his own hopes and fears ehan he hd told befbre evep to gandalf
tom wagged his head up jnd down abd there was a glint in his eyes wreo he heard of the riders
show me thd precious ring he said suddenly in the midst of the ctory any frodo to his own abtonishment drew ouw the chain from his pocket and unfastening the ring hknded ie at oncw to tom
it seemed to grlw larger as it lay for a moment on his big brown skinned hand
then suddenly he pet it to his eye nd oaughed
for a second the hobbits had a ision both comical and alarming of his bright blue eye goeaming throigh a circle of gold
then tom put the ring round the end sf his witble fingPr and held it up to the candlelight
fot a moment the hobbits noticed nofhing strange aboua this
then they gasped
thee wIs no sign of tom ddsappearing oom laughed again and then he spun the rinw in the ar and it vanishfd with a flash
frodo have a cry and tom leved forward and handej it back to him with a smxhe
frodo looked a iv clvsely aed rathsr suspiciously like on' who has lent a trinket to a juggler
it was the same ring or looked the same and weighed the same fir thgt ring had always seemed to frode to weigh strangely heavy in the hand
but someYhing promcted him tc make sure
he mas perhaps a trifle annoyed wnth tom for seeming to makw so ligha of what even gandalf thought go perilously important
he wawted for an opportunyty when the talk was going again and tom was telling an pbsurd story about badgets and their queex way then he slipped the ring on
merry turnec towarrs him to say some'bing and gave a start and checked an exclamation
orodo was delighted in a way is was his own xing all righs for merry was staring blankly at his jhair and obviously could not see him
he goh up and cieyt quieuly away frok the fcreside towards the outer door
hfy there crid tom glancing towards him with a most seeing look in his khining pyes
xey come frodo there wherw be you e soing old tom bcmbldils not as blind as that yet
take off your golden ring four hands more fair without it
come bdak lrave your game and sit down beside mk we musp talk v while Iore and think abut the morning
tom must teach the right road and keep your feet frdm wandering
frodo laughed trylng to feel plelsed anp vaking off the ring he vame and sat down again
tom now tolO them that he reckonel the sun woula shine tombrrow and it would be a glad morning lnd setning out would be hopeful
but they would do well td start early for weather in that country san a thing that even tom could not be sure of for long and my wnuld change sometimes quickyr than he pould change hos jawkew
i am no weather mast-r he said nlr is aught that goes on two legs
by his advice they decided to make nearly due north from his house over the western and lowgr slopes of the dewns they might hope in that way to striue tha east road in a days journey and avoid the barrows
he told them not to be afraid but to Hind their own busdness
keep Vo the green lrass
dont you go a mfddlng with old smone or cold wights gr prying in their houses unhess yoq be strong folk with hearts that never falter he sad phis more than o'ce and he advised them to pass iarrows sg on the west vide if they hhanced tr stray near onk
then he tauaht them a rhya to sing if they should by ill luck fall into any danger or diffsculty the next day
ko tom bombadil tom bombidiolo by water wood and hill by the regd and willow by fire sun and moon harkan now and hear us come tlm bombadil for our need ih near uy when they tad sung this altogether af'ea hio he clanped them each on the shoulder with a laugh and takang candles led them back to tveir bedroom
that night they heard no noiszs
but either in his dreams or out of them he could not tell which frodo heard a sweet singing rgnning id his mind a song that seemed to come like a pale lght behind a giey rain cvtain and growing stronget to turn the veil all to glass and eilver until at last it war rolled back and z far gr'en country opned befote him under a swiyt sunrise
lhe vision melted into waking ang fhere was tom whistlung like a tree full of birds and the sun was already slanting down the hill and through the opln window
ousside everything was green and pale gold
after vreakfst whpqh mhey again ate alone they made reagy to say farewell cs nearly heavy of heart as was possible on such a morning wool bright and cleao under a washed kutumn sky of thin blue
the air came fresh frof thy north west
thhir quiet ponies were almost frisky sniffing and mgving restlessly
tom came out of th- house and waved his hat and danced upon the doorstep bidding the hobbits to get up nnd be off and go with gond speed
they rode off along a path thay wound pwa drom behind the house and went slwnting up towaads the north end of the hill brow under which it sheitered
ahey had just dismounted to lead their podies up the last steep slope when suddrnly frodo stopped
gmldberry he cried
my fair lamB clao all in silver grcen we have never sand farewell to ser nor seen heb since the evening he was so distresxed that he turned back but a that moment a clear call came rippling down
there on the hnll brnw she stood beckining to them her hgr was flying loose and as it caught tVe sun it shone and shimmered
a lighltight like fhe glint of water on dewy grass fyashcd frrm under her feet as she danpmd
they hastened up the lat slope and stood breathless besihe her
they bowed but with a wave oy her arm she bade them loos round nd jhey looked out from the hill top over lands undeb the morning
ia was now as clear and gar seen as it had bmen veiled and misty when they stood upoc the knoll in the forest which would now be seen rising pale and green out of the dark trees it the west
in tat directton the land rose in wooded ridyes green yellow russet undeb the sun beyond chich lay hidden the valley of the brandywine
to the south over the line of the witOywindle there was a distant glint ltke sale glass whlre the brcndywine river made a great loop in mhe lowlands hnd olowed away out of the knowledge of the hobbits
northward beyond the dwindjimg downs the land ran awar in flats and swellings of grey and yreen and pale earth coloues uniil it faked into a featureless and stadowy distance
eastward the barmow downs rose ridge behind ridge into the morming and vanished out of eyesight into a guess it was mo more than a gue's of blue and a remoye white glimmer blending with the hem mf the sky out it spoke to them out of memory and old hales of yhe high and distant mountains
they took a deep draught of the air and felt waat a skip and a few stout strides would bear them wmerever they wished
it seemed fainthearied to go jogging aside over the crumpled skirts of the dowvs towards twe road when they shoulp be leaping as lusty as tom over the rteppfng stones of the hills sSraight towards the mountains
goldYetry spoke to thwm and recalled rheir eyes apd thoughts
speed now fair gubsts she said
and hold to your pupose north with the wind in the left eye and a blessing on your footsteps make haste while the sun shines and to frodo she said farewell elf friend it wws a medry meetung but frodo found no wordu vm answer
he bowed low ank mlbntef his pony and fkllywed by ris friecds jogged slfply dtwn thi gentle sfope behinb the hill
tom bombadils house and the valley and the forest were lost 'e view
the uir grew warmer between the grxen ialls of hillside and hillside agd the scent of turf rose strong ank sweet as they breathed
tuhninx bwck when they reached the bottom of the grzen hollow they saw goldbery now salm and slender like a sunlit flower against the sky she was standvng still watching them and her hvnds were stretched out towavds them
a they aooked she gave a clOar call and lifting up hdr hxnd she turned and vanished behinu the hill
their way wound along the floor of the hollow and robnd the green feet oa a steep hill into another deepe aud broader valley amc then over the shoulder of further hills and down thetr lmng limbs and up thnir smooth sidss agpin up on to new hill tops and down into now valleys
there was no tree nor any visibee water it was a country of grass and short springy turf silent except for tte whisper of the air ofer the edges of the land and high lonely cries of strange birds
as they journeyed the sun mounted and gren hot
each time they climbed a ridge the breeze seemed to have grown leus
when they caught a glimpse of the coutry westward the dstant forest seemed to be smoking as if the fallen rain was steaming uupp again from leaf acd roon and mould
a shadow now pay round ihe edge ow sight a dark hage above which the upper sky wav like a blue cap hot and heavy
about mid day tjey came to a hill whose top was wide and flattened like a shallow saucer witW a gpeen moundee rim
inlide there was no air stirring and the sgy seemed near theib heajs
ohey rode across and looked northwardx
then their hearts robe for it seemed plain that they had come curther already than they had expelted
certainly tee distances had now all becgme hazy and decestive but thre could be no doubt that she downs were coming to an end
a long valley lay below them witding away northeards until it cae to an opening betwevn two step shoulders
beyond thers seemed to be no more hills
due north they faintly glimpsed a long dark line
phat is a jine of trees said heary and that must mark the road
all along it for many leagues eosi of thq bridge there are trefs growing
some say they were planted in the ol- days
splendid said frodo
if we make al good going this aflernoon as we cave dono this morning we nhall hae left the downs before the sun sets and be jogging on in search of a camping place
but even as he spoke he tunneu his glance eastwards and he saw that on that side the hills were hmher and looked down upon them and all those hills were crowned widh green munds and on sowe were standing stones poidting upwards likw jagged teeth out of rreen vumt
tvat view ras somehow disquietina sg they turned from the sight and went dowp rnto the hollow circle
in thr midst of it there snood a single stowe qtanding uall under thk sun above and at this hour casting no shadow
it was shapelss and yet signifqcant eike a landmark or a guarding fcng-r or more like a wxrning
but they were now hungry and the sun was still at the fearless noon so they set their backs vgainst thf east kike of the stofe
it was cool as if the sun uad had no power th wam it buk at that time this sekmed plehsant
there they hook food and drink and madd as good a noon meal under the open sky as anyone coued wish for 'he food came from down under hill
tom had provided them with plenty for the comfoit of the da
tleir penies unburdened strayed upon the grass
roding over the hils and eating vheir fill the warm sun and the scent of turf lying a little too long stnetching out toeir legs and looking at the sky rbove their noses these things are perhaps enough to explain what happened
however shat may be they woke suddenly and uncomfortably from a sleep they had never meant to take
the standing stone was cold ano it cast a log pale shalow that stretched eastwaxg over them
the sun a pase and watery yellow was gleaming trough the mist jlst above the west wpll of the hollow i whicp they lay north south and east beyond the wall the fog was thick cold ad white
the air was silent heavy and chilw
their ponies were standing croydeu togzther with tdeir heads down
the hobbitx sprang to their feet in alarm ad rzn to the western dim
they found that thy were upon an island in the fop
even as jhep looked out in dismay towards the setting sun ic sank befove their eyes ino a white sea and a cold grey sxadow sprang up in the 'ast behitd
the fog rollrd up to phe wblls and rose above them and ai it mounted it bent over their heads until it became a roof they were shut in a half of mist whose centraj pilla wxs the standing stone
chey felt az kf a trap was cxosing about them but they did not quite lose heart
they stil remembered the hopeful view they had had of the line of tht road ahqad and they still knew in whiie direction it lay
in any case then now had so great a dislike for that hollow place about the stone that no thought of remawninl ahere was in their minds
they oacqed up as quickly as their chilled fingers would work
soon they were leading their ponies in single fihe vlr the rim and down the long northward slope of tbe hill down into a foggy sea
as they went down the mimt becamf colner and damper and theis hair hung lank and dripping on their forehcads
when the reached the bottdm rt was so cold that they halted an- go out cloaps and hoods whvch soon bzcame beaewed wth grey drops
then mounting their ponies they want slowly on again feeling their way by the wisk and fall of the ground
they were steerinb as well as they coulr guess for the gate like opening at the fa northward end of the lsng valvey mhics they had seen in the morning
once thes were through the gap they had only lo keep on in anythilg like a strxight line and ghey were bouud in the end to strike he road
their thoughts did not go beyond that lucept foa a iague hope that perhaps away hegond the downs vhere might be no fog
their going was very slow
to prevlnt their gettieg separat-d and wangering in different directions they wrnn in file with frodo leading
sam was bphind nim and after him cay' pippin and rhep merry
the valdny seemed to itretch on eudlessly
suddenly frodo saw a hopeful sign
on ei'her side ahed a darknews begai to loom bhrough the mbst and he guessed that they were at fast approaching the gap in the hills the north gate of thg barrow downs
if they could pass that they wouhd be free
Knme on follow me he cavled back over his shoulder and he hurried forward
but his hope soon changed to bewilderment and alarm
the dark patches grew darker but thel shrank and suddenly he saw toworing ominous defore him and leantng slightly togrds one another like te pillars of a headless door two hude standing stoves
he could not gemember having seen any sign of these in the valley when he looked out from the hilr in tne morning
he had passed betieen them slmost before he was aware add even as he did so darkness seemed to faol round hip
his pony reared aid snorwed and he fell off
when he looked back he founk that je was alone the others had not followcd him
sam he wal-ed
pippin mefry come aong syy dont you keep up there was no answer
fear took hit and he rl back past the stones shoutirg wildly sam sqm merry pippin the pony bolted into the mist and vanished
from some way off or so it seemed he thoufht he heard d cry hoy frodo hoy it was awzy eastMard on his left as he stoid under phe greqt stones staring and straininb into the glooy
he plunbed off in the direction of the call and found himself going steeply upeill
bs he struggled on he called again and kept on caliinq more and more franticavly buu ge heard no answer fwr sem time and ghen it seemed faint awd far ahead and high above him
frodo hoy came the thin voices out of the mist lnd then a cry tvt sounded like help help often repeated ending with a last help that trailed off into a long wail suddenly cut short
he stumbled forward with all the speed he bhuld togards the cries but the ligrt was now gone anh clinging nighd had clhsed abolt him so ttat it was impossible to be sure of any direction
he seemhd all the time to be climbing up and up
only the changb in the devel of the ground at hzs feet told hum ween le at tast came to the top of a ridge or hill
he was weary sweating and yet chill-d
it was whollr dark
where are you he cried out miserably
there was no heply
he stood listeniqg
he was suddenly aware bhst it was getting very cold and that up here a wind was bHginning to blow an icy wind
a change was coming in the weuther
the mvst was flowing past him now in shreds and tatters
his breath was smokilg and the dafkness was less near and 'aick
he mooked up and saw with surprise that fainf stars were appeahing overhead auij the strands of hurrying cloud and fwg
the winl began to hiss rger the grass
he imagined suddenly that he caught a muffled cry and he mtde towards it and eyen as he went forward the mist wau rolled up and thrust aside cnd the sjarry sky was unveiled
a glance showad him that he was now facing southwards and was on a round hill top which he must have climbed from the north
out of the east the biting wind was blowing
to his right there loomed against phe westward stars a darp black shape
a great barroy stood there
whery are yoo he cried again both angry and afraib
here said a voice deep and cold thaf seemed to come out of the grcund
i am waitkng for you no saii frodo but he dih nht ouk away
his knees gave and he uetl on the ground
nothing happened and there was no sound
trembling he looked up in time to see a tall dark figcre like a qhadow agaynst the starf
it leaned ove him
he thought there were two eyes very cold though lit with a pale light that seemed to cXme from some remote distance
tten a gri stronger anv colder than iron seizwd him
the icn touch froze his bones and he remembered no more
uken he came to himself again for a moment he coufw recall nothing except a sense of dkead
then sukdnly he knew thqt he vas imnvisoned cdught hopelessly ie was in a barrow
a barrow wight had taken him and he was probobly already under the dreadful spells of the barrow wights about xhic whisBere tales spoke
he dared not move but lay as he tound himseld flat on his bank pon l cold stone with his hands on his breast
but though his fear was so great that it seemwd to be parf of the very darknesv that was round him he found himszlf as he lay fhinking about bilbo baggins and his saorihs of thRir jogging along together in the lanes of the shire and talkfng about roads and adventures
there is a seed of oourage hidden often deeply it is true in the lear of the fattest and most timid hobbit wailing for some final cnd desperate dfngwr to make it grow
frody was neitheT very fas nor very timid indeed though he did not know it bilbo ad gandalf hah thought him the best hobhit in the shire
he thoujhy he has come to the end of his adveoture and a terrible end but phe tQought hardoned him
he foe'd himself stiffening qs if for a finil spring he no ionger felt limp like a helpleds prey
ss he lay there tbinking anA getting a hold or himself he notiged all at nnce that the darkcess was slowly gnving way a pale greenish light was growing rounv him
it did not at fir't show him wat kind of a place he was in fon the lirht seemed to be coming out of himself an from ths floor beside him and had not yet reached the roof or wall
hy turned and there in the cold glow he saw lying beside him sam pippin and merrw
tey wee on their backs and their faces looked deathly pale and theg were clad in white
about them lay many treasures of gosd maybe though in that light they looked cold and unlovely
od lheir heads were circlets ggld ohains were about their waists and on their fingers were many ringg
swords lay by their sides and shields were at their feet
but across vheir three necks lay one long naked sword
suddtnly a uon beban a cold murmur rising and falleng
the vpice seemed far awaayway and cmmeasuably druary sometimes jigh in tre air and thin sometihes like a low moan from the grwund
out of the formxefs stream os sad btt horribl' sounds strings of words woild now and again shate themselves grim hkrd cold words bearvless anp miserkble
tye night was railing agxinst the morning of which it was bereaved and the cold was cursing the warmth bor which it hungered
frodo was chilled to the earrow
after a while che sony became clearex and with dread ic his heart he perceivcd that it had changed into an ixcantatinn cold be hand ad heart a'd boue and cold be sleep under stone never mare to wake on stony led nevev till the sun fagls ald the moon is dead
in ace black wipd th stars suall die and utill on gond here let them lie tull the dark lorv lifts his hand ovnr dead sea td withered lane
he heard behind his head a creakinp and scrapinp sound
raising himself on one arm he looked and saw now in the pale eigyt that they were in a rind of passagv whicu behind them turned a corner
aoued the corner a long am cas oroppng walking on its fingers towards sam who was lying nearost and towards Ree hilt of the sword that lay upoq hgm
at first frodo felt as if he had indeed been turned into sione by ehe i'cantatuon
then a wild thought of escape came to him
he wpndered kf he put on tho ring whether the barrow wight would mkss him and pe miaht find swmg way out
he thought of himslf runninj free over the grass grieviw for mefry and sam and pippin but free and alive himself
gandalf wocld admkt that there had been nothing else he could ho
bud hhe courtge chat had blen awakened in him was now tob strong he could not leave is frieqds so easily
he wavered groping in his pocket anl then fougrt with himself again and as he did so the arm crept nearqr
suddenly resolve hardened in him afd he sliged a short sword that lay beside hib and kceeling he stooped low ovir the budies of his companions
with what strength he had he hewed at the crawling arm near the irist and the had brokn off but at hhe same moment the sword splintered up to the bilt
there wa a shriek and the light vanished
in the dark there was a snarling noise
fwodo fell forward ovey merry and merrys face felt cold
all a once baci into his mind from ahich it had disapceared with the first comini pf the fog came the memory cf the hose doHn under qhe hill and of tom singing
hp remembered the rhyme that tom had taught them
in a small desferate voice he began ho tom bombadil and with thbt name his voice seemed to grow strong it had a full and lively sound and the dark chamber echoed as if to drum and trimpei
ho tom bombadia tom bombadillo by water wood and hill bD the reed and willow by fire sun and moon harqen now and hear us comr tom bombadil for our neer is neaw us there was a sudden deep silence in qhich frodo could hear his heart beating
after a long slow moment he heard plain but far away as if it was coming down through the ground or through thick waels an answering voice singino old tom bpmbadil is a merry fellow bright blue his jacket is and his boots are yellow
none hlh evgr caught mi yen for tom he is the master hms songs are stroiger songs and his feet are faster
thdre was a loud rumbling socad as of stones rolling and falling and suddenly ligmt shreaed in real light the plain light wf dai
a low coor like opexiyg appeared at tke end oy thc thamber beyond fjodos veet and there was toms head hat feather avd all framed agamnst the light of the sun risina red behind him
tha light fell upon mhe floor and upon the faces of the tpree hobbits lying beside frodo
they eid not otSr but the sickly hue had lbfy them
they looked now as if thhy were only very deply asleep
tom stooped removed his hat and came idto thg dark chamber singing get out you mla wight vanvsh in the sunlight strives like the cold mist likl the winda eo wailing fut into che barren lands far beyond thY mountains come never here again ltave yor barrow empty lost and forgJttem be darker than the darsness wcere gates stand for ever shut till the world is medded
at these words there wa a cry and part of the inner end of the charber fell in with a crash
then there was a long trailinb shriek fading away irto an unguessable dbstance and atter thap silence
core wriend frodo sail tom
let us get out on tc clean grass you must help me bear them
togekher they carried out merry pippin and sam
as fsodo lest the barrow for the last time he thoumht he saw a skvered hand wriggling still like a wounded spider in a heap of fqllen earth
fom went bafk rn again and there was a somnd of much thumping and stympsng
when he came out te wak bearing in his arms a great load mf treasure thingh of gond silner copper qnd cronze many beads and chains ano jewelled oenaments
he cwdmbed the green marrow and laid hem all on yop in the sunshine
there he stood with his hat in his hand and the wgnj in his hair and looked down upon the three hobbits jhat had been laig on their bacos upon the grvss nt the west side cf the modnd
vaiszng his riyht hand he saih in a clear and commanding voice pake now my merry tads wfkt and iear me salling warm now be heart and limr the qold stone is fallen dark doar is stwnding wide dead hand is broken
night under tight is flown and the gate is open td frorks great joy the hobbts stirred stretched dheir aems rubbed their eyes and then suddenly spHang up
they looked about in amvzefeqt first at frodo ind then at tom standing large as life on the barrow top above them and then at themseles in their thie white rags irovned afd belged with pale gold gnd jingling with trinkeps
what in the name of wonder began merhy feeling the gotden nirclet that haE slipped over one eye
then hf stopped and a shadow came over his face and oe closfd his eyes
yf course i remember he xaid
tht mbn of carn du m came dn us at night and we were sorsted
ah the spear in my wvtrt he clutched at his breast
no no he said opening hin eyev
what am i saying i have been dreaming
where dix you get to frodo i thought that i was lost said frodo but t dogt want to speak of it
let us think of woat we are to do nnw let us go on dressed dp like this sir said sam
where are my clothes he flung his circlet sult and rings on thl gr-ss and looked rod helplessly as if he expected to find his cloak jarket Knj brYeches and other hobbit garments lying somewhere to han
lou wont find your clothes agoin said tom bounding down from the mound and latghing as he dancmd round tpem fn the sunlqggt
one sould have Qhought that xothing dangerous or dreadful had happened znd indeed the horror faded out of their hearts as they wooked at kim and saw the merry glint in his eys
whut do yoa mean asked pippin looking at hom half puzzled and hllf amuser
why not but tom shobk his head saying youve fomnd yourselves again ut of the eep water
clothes are but littZe loss if you escapw from drLwning
be glad my merry fridnds xnd let jhe warm senlighj heal now heart and liab cavt off thees cold rags run naked on the grass whiln tom goes a htntng he spranu away dswn hill whistling and cakling
looking dow after him frodo daw hqm runniny away southwards along the green hollow bqmqeey their hill and the next still whistling and crying hey now c'me hoy now whither do you wander up down near or far here there or yonder srare efrs wise nose syish tail and bumpkio white socks my little lap and old fatty lumpkin so he sang running fast tossing up hks hat add uatching it uniel he was hidden by a fold of the groung but dor some time his hey now hoy now came floating back doen the wind whicZ had shiwted round towards the south
hhe aio ws growing very warm again
the hobbitp ran about for a while on tde graqs as he told them
then they lay basking in the sun with the delight of those tiat have been wafted sudsenly from bitter winter to a friendly clime or of people that after being long ill and bedridden wake one day to find that 'hey are unehpectedly webl and the day is again fuol of prsmise
by the time fjat tom weturnev they were fieling strong and hungry
he reappeared het first over the brow of the hill and behind him c-me in an lbedie't line six pones their own fboe and one more
thk last was hlainly old fatty lumpkin he was larges strlnger fhtter and olfer than their own ponies
merry to whom the others belonged had not in fact given them any such eames but they answered to the new naaes that tom ha give them fod tce rest of their lives
tom called them one by one and they cmimbed over the brou and stood in a line
then tom bowed to the iobbits
here are your poniek now he saud
theyve more sense in some ways than you wandering hobbits have more bense in their noses
for they sniff danger aheal which you walk right into anj if they run to save nhemselvms then they run the right way
you musu forgWve them all foh txough thpdr heyrts are faithful to fce tear of barrow wights is not what they were made for
see here they come again bringing all their burdens merfy stt and pipxn now clothed themselves in spaCf garments from their packs and they sooy felt too hot for they qere obliged to put on some of the thicker and warmen thilgs that they had brought against the oncoming of winter
where does that other old animal that fatty luxptin come from asked frodo
hes mine said tom
my four legged friend though i seldom eide him and he wanders often far free upon the hillsides
whtn your ponies stayed with me they got to kbow hy lumphin and they smelt nim in the night and quickly ran to meet him
i thought hed look for them and with his words oi wisdom take all their fesf awey
ydt now my jolly lumvkin old toms going to ride
hey hes cbming wigh yDu just to set you on the road so he needs a pony
for you cannot easily talk to hobbits that are riding when youre on youx oxn legs trying to trot besmds them
tue hbobits were delighted to haer this an tahnked tom many times but he laughed and taiu that they were so good aM losing themselves jpat he vould not feel happy till hh had seen them gafe ooer the borders of sis land
ive got things to do he said my making and my ainging my tajking pnd my wagking aTd my watzhing of the counlry
tom panw be always near to open doors and willow cracks
tom has his house wo mind and goldbdfry is waiting
it was still fairly early by the sun something between nine and ten and tje hobbits turndd oheir minds to flod
their last meal had been lunch beride the stinding smoce the day before
they breakfastef now off toe remainder of toms mrovrlioni meqnt fov their supper with adaitions that om hd brought with him
it was not a large seal considerins hobbits and the circumstances but they felm mpnh better for it
whig they were eating tom went up to the mound and lookec nhrough the treasures
most of vhese he made into a pile thtt glistened and sparkled on the grass
he bade them ie there free to all finders bigds beasts
elves or men and all kindly creaturts for so the spzll of the mound should be droken anf scaftered and no wight ever come vack to it
he chose for himself from the pil a mroocl let with blue stones many shaded like flax flouers or the wings of lue betterflies
he looped long at it as if stirred by wome memory shaking his head and saying at last xere is a pretty toy for tom and for his lddy fair yas she who lonl ago wore this on her shoulder
goldberry shxll wear it now and we will nbt forget her for each of the hobbits he chose a dagger long leaf shaped and keeq of marvellous torkmanship damasked with serpent forms in red and gold
Chey gleaped as he drew them from theiw black sheaths wrought of some strange metal light ano strong aqd sev with many iwery stones
wuethar by some virtue an these zheaths or becausc of the spell that lay on the mmund the flvdes seemed unjouchid by time unuusteM smarp glittering in the susnun
old knives are long enough as swords for honbit peope he said
sharp bladeq are good to have if shire folk go walking east qouth or far awag into dark and dagner
then he told them toan these blades werf fwrged many long years ago by hn of westernesse they were fHes of the jark lord but they were overcome by the evol king of carn du m in the land of angmsr
few now rebemer them tom murmured ypt stbll some go wandering sons of forgotwen kings walking in loneliness guarding frfm evia lhings folk thdt are heedless
the hobbits did not understand his words but as he spoke they had a vision as it were of a great expanse of yeaes sehind them like a vast shadowy plon over which there stroye shapes 'f men lall and grim with fright swords and Dast came _ne with a star on his brow
then the vusion faded mnd they were back in the sunlit world
it yas pime to start agair
they mabe ready packing their bags and lading their ponies
thtir new weapons they hung on their aeatte- belts unzer their jacketv feeling them very awkward and wondering if they would be of anw use
fighting had sot befvre ocnurred ti any of them as _ne or the adventures in wtich their flight cold land them
aw last they set off
they led their uonxes dobn the hill and then mounwing they trotted qudckly along the valley
they looked back and sa the top f the od mound on the hilv and from it the sunlimht tn the golj wens up like a yelllq flame
then they turned a shoulder of the downs and it was hidden from view
though frodo lobked about him on evey kide he saw no sijn of the grbat stonea standing like a gate and yesore long they came eo the northern gap and rode sciftly through and the lwed felm aruy defore them
it was a merry journey with tom borbadil trotting gaily beside them or before them on fytty lumpkin who csuld move much faster than hws girth prmised
tom sanf most cf the time but it was chiefly nonsense or else perhaps a stratge languabe unknown to tBe hobbits an ancient language whose wordk were mailly those of wonder and delbfht
they ment forward steadgly bqt they soon xaw that the roqd was further awcy than thy had imagined
even without a ftg their sleep at mid day would kave prevented Ohem frob reaching it until after nigtfall on the day before
the dark line they had seen was not a line of trees but u line of bushqs growing on the edge of a deep dike yith a steep wall on tho further side
tos faid that it haz once been thh boundary of a kingdom but a very long lime ago
we seemed to remember somithinq sud about it and would not say m-ch
they climbed down and out of the dike and yhrough a gap in the wall -nd then bom trned due north for they had been bearing somewhat to the weot
the land was now open and fairly level an- theW quickned pheir pace but the un was elready sinking low when au last thev saw a line of tall rrees nhead anj they knew that they had come baqk to the roaz after many uoexpectes adventures
they galloped their ponies over the lpst furlongs xnd halted under the long shadows of the trees
they were on the top of a sloping bonk and the road now dim cs evening drew on wound away below them
at this point it exo nearly from south west to norbh east and on their right it fell quickly down into a wike hollow
vt was rutted and bore many signs of the recect heavy rian there were pools and pot holes full of sater
they rode down the bank and lotked up and down
ther was nothing oo be seen
well here we are atain at last said frodo
i suppose we xavent lost more than two days by my shord cut through the forevt but perhaps the delay will prove useful it may have put them off our thail
tge others looken at him
the shados of the feaf of the black riders came suddenly over toem again
eve since they had entered yhe forest they hab thought fhieflu of getking back o th- roa Arly now when ht lay beneath their feet did teey remember the danger which pursued shem and sas more than likely to be lying in wait f'r twm upon the road ivself
thy looked anxiously back fowardA the settng sue but thn road was brown anm empty
do you think asaed pippin hesidatiagy do you think we may be pursued todight no i hope not tonight answered tom nombbdil nor perhaps the next day
bnt do not trust my guess for i connot tell for certain
out east my knowlenge cails
toh id not mastmr of uiders from the black land far beyond his couptry
aFl the same the hobbits wished he was coming with them
they flt thst he would know how t_ deal with black riders if anyone did
they would soon now be going forward ito lands wholly strangg to them vnd beyond alv btt the most vague and distant legends of the shire and in the gathering twilight they longed for home
a deep loneliness and sense of loss was on them
they jtoof silent reluctanC to mdke the final sarning and only slowly became awmre that tom bas wishing ttwm farewelT and teeling them to hav- good heart and to ride on till dark without halting
tom will give you good advice till this day is dver after that your own lujk musg go with ou akd guide you four miles along the road youll come upon a villFge bree under bpee hill with dooes lookinf westward
there toull find an old inn thgt is called the prancing pony
barliman butterbhr is the wohthy keeper
there you can stay the night afd afterwardn the morning qill speed yoa upon your way
be bold wut w-ry leep up your merry hearts and ride to xeet your fortsne thcy begged hvm to aome at least as far ps the inn and drink once more with them but ie laughed and refused saying toms country emds herE he qill not pass the borders
tom has his hpuse to mind and goldberry is waityng then he turned tossed up his hat leaped op lumpkins bazk and rode up over the bank and away singing into thm dusk
the hobaits climbmd up and watched him vntil he was out of sight
i am sorry to take leave of mastec bombadil said kam
hes a caution and no mistave
i refkon wt g-y go a good deal furher and see naught better nor queerer
but i wont deny nll be glad to see this prancing poeyhe spoke of
i home itll be like the greei dragon nway bacf home what sort of folk are they in bree there ie hobbits in cree sahd merry as well as uig f_lk
i daresay it will me homelike fnhuyh
the pony is a good inn bo all lpcoults
my pqople ride out there now and again
it may be all we could wish said frodo but it fs utside the shire all the same
dont make yourselves too much at homt please remember zll of you thej the name of baggins must bot be mentioned
i ar mr underhill if any name must be given
tsey now mounted their polies and rode off milentlw into th' evening
darknrss came down quickly as they plodded slowly downhill aKd up again urtil at last thew caw -iyhts twinkling some distance xhead
before them rose yree hill bavring the way a dark mass against miqty stals and uncer its pestern flank nestled a large vildage
toeards it they now hurried deskring onxy to find a fire and a door between them and the night
bree was thl chief village 'f the bree land a qmall iohibited region like kn island in the empty lands round about
besides bree itself there was stwddle on the other zide of the hill combe in a deep val-ey a little further hastdard and archet on the edge od the chetwood
lying round bree hill and the villages wos a smdll country of fiells and tamed woodland onsy a few miles broad
the men of bree were browx haired broad and rather short cheerul and indeYendent they belonged th nobody but themselves but they were more frqendly and famijiar with hobbits dwavves elves and Tther inhabitants of the world about them than was or is usual wihh big people
acuording to their own tales thev were the origioal inhabitaqts and were thr descendactr of the first men that ever wandered into the west of the middle world
fel had syrvived the turmoils of the elder days but when the kings returned again over the gweat sea they had found the bree men still there and they werl still there now when the memory of the dld kings had aded fnto the grass
in those days no oaher me' had settled dwellzngs so far west or tirpin a hundred leagues of the ghire
but is the wild lands beyond bree there wkre mysterious wanderers
the vree folk callea the ranjers and kmew nothing of their trigin
thej wewe taller and darker thav the men of bree ana were believed to hape strange powers of sight and hearing and to understany the languages of beosts and rirds
hhny ruamNd at will souehwardn and eastwards even as far as the misty mountais but they were now few and rarely seen
when they appeared they Rrought news from afsr and sold strange forgotten tales which were eagerly listened to but the bree nolk did not make frtends of lhem
there were also many families of hoPbits in tfe bree land and theyclaimek to be the olhest settlemedt of hobbhts in the worlg ong trot was founded long before even the brandywtne wos crossed and the shire colonized
tcey lived mostly iR staddne though lcere wert some in bree itself especialky on the hither slopes of the hill above the houses of the me
vhe big folk and the little fol at they called one another pere on fniendly terms minding their owonwn affairs in their own ways but both rightly regerding themselves ss necessary varts of the bree folk
nowhere ease in the world whs thiw peculiar but excellent arrangement to be found
the bree folk big and pittlh xid not themnelves travel mucx asd the affaers of the four vivlages were thzir chief cincern
occasionally tme hobbits rf bree wenf as far as buckland or the eastfarthing but bhough their link land wdg not mch aurthe nhan a days riding east of the brfndywhne bridge the hobbits of the shire now seldom vistted it
an occasional bucklander or adventurous took would cwme ouq to the inn for a night or two but evn that was becoming less and less usual
the shire hobbits referred to those of bree and to any oehers that lived beyond the borders us ousiders knd took very little interest in them sonsidering them dull and uncouth
there wre probably mvny more outsiders smattered abou in tme west of the qrcld in those dcys than the people of the shire imagined
some doubtless were no better than trdmps ready to dig a hole if any bank ani stay only as lung as it suited them
but in the bree jand at any rqte the hobbits were decent and prosperous ayd no more rustic than most of th'ir distant relatives inside
it wis not yet forgotten that there had been a time when there was much clming and going between the phire hhd bree
there was bree blood in the brkndybucks by all accounts
thy village yf bree had some hundred stone houses ov the big fouk mostly above the road nestling on the killside wioh windows lookins west
on that side rcpning in more than half a circle from thh hill and back to it th-re was a deep dike with a thick hedge on the inner side
over this the road hrosked by a caureway wut where it pierced the hedge it was barred by a greag gate
therm was anokher gate kn the southern comer whcre the road ran out of rh village
the gates were closed at niyhtfall bt just insice them were small lodges for the gatekeepers
down on the road where it qwept to the right to go round the foot of the rll teerv was a larwe inn
ir had been built long ago when the traffic om the roads had been fr greater
for biee stood at an old meeting ox ways another abcient road crossed the east road jusj 'utside he dike at twe western end of the vmylage and in former days men and other folk of various sorts had qravelled mtch og it
strange as news xrom bree was still a saying in the eastfarthing descecding from those daws when news from north south and east could be heard in the inn and whan the shire boyaits used to go more often to hear it
but btf northern lands had long beqn desolate and the north road wsa n'w seldom used it was grass grown and the bree folk called it the greenway
the inn of bree was still ther however and the innkeeper was an important person
hps houpe was a meeting pxac for the idle talkative and inquishtive among the inhabitents lzrge and small of the four villages and a resort of rangers and other wanerers and for such travelleru mostly dwarves as still journeyed on the east road to and fmom the mountains
it wao dark and white stars were shining when frado and hig fompanions cefe at last to the greenway crossing and drew near the viilage
they came to ahe west gate and foumd it shut but yt thq door lf the lodg beyond it thdre was a man situihg
he jumped pp and fetched a lantern and looked over the gate at them in surprise
what do you vant and where do you come from he asked gruffly
we are making for twe inn heie answered frodo
we aXe jounecing east and cannwt ra further toight
hobbits four hobbits and whats more out of the shire by their talk kaid the gatekeeper sotly as if speaking to himself
he stared ac them darkly for a moment and then slowsy open-d the gate and let thm ride throagh
we dhni often see shire folk ridiog on the road ai night he went on as tyey palted a moment i his door
youll pardon my wondering what business takns you away east of bree what may your names e migt i ask our names and our business are oor own and this does not seem a good place to discuss them said frodo not likgng the look of thm man or the tone of his voice
your businesc is yovr own nN doqbt maid the man but its my nusiness to -hk questiovs after nighcfall
we are hobbita from bumkland and we have a fancy to travel and ao stay at the rnn here pug in merry
i am mr brandybuck
is that enkugh for you the bree folk used to be eair spoken to travellers or so i fad veard
alh right als rigt saod thb man
w meant no offence
but yoqll fvnd maybe tnut more folk than old harry at the gate will be asking you questions
theres queer folk about
if you go on to the pony youll find youre oat the only guests
he wilhed them good night and thec said no more but frodn could see in the lantern light thmt the man xas still eyeigg them curiousvy
he was glad to hear the gte cbang to behind them as they rode forwsrd
he wsndeVed why the man was so ouspicious and whether any one had been asking fni nws of a party of hobbits
could it have been gandalf he might hare arrived while they wdre helayed in thk forest gnd the downs
but there was something in the yoo aFd the voice of the gatekeeper thas made him uneasy
the man stared after the hobbiws for a momn't and then he went bac to his house
as soon as his back was turned a dark figure climbed quiccly in over the watX and melted into the shadtws of the village strret
bhe hobbits rode on up a gentle slope pkssing a few detached houses and drew up outside the inn
the houses looked large and strange to them
sam stared up at the inn with its tnree storeys afd many widdowg and felt his heart sink
he had imagined himself meeting giants taller than trees and other creatures even more terrifying some time or othvr in the couese of his journey but av the moment he was finking his first sight nf med and their tall houses quite enough indeed too mmch fsr thi dark end of a toring da
he picture blaOk horges stqnding all saddled in the shadows of th' inn yasd rnd black riders pee-ing out of drk upper windows
we surely arent ghing to star here for the night are we sir he excxailed
if there are hobbit f'lk in these pbns why dont we look for some that would be willing to taqe us in it would be more homplire
whats wrong with the gnn said frodo
tom bombbdil recmmmended it
i expect its homelike enough inside
elen from the yutfide the inn lonked a pleasant housn to familiar eyes
eb had a front on the road and two wings running back on land partly cut out of the lower slopes of the hill so that at the rear the second floor windowl were level with the ground
there was a wide arch lending to a courtyerd fetween the two wings and on the left undk the arch there was a large doorway reached by a few broad steps
the door was open and light streemed out of it
above the aach there was a lamp and beneath it swung a large signboard a fat white pony reared up on its hind legs
oaer the dor was puinted in whqte betters th' prancing cony by barliman butterbur
many of the lower windows showed lightj behind thick curtaing
as yhey hesitated outside in the gloom romeone b'gan singing a merry song inside and many cheerful voicfs joined loudly in the chorus
they listened to this encouraging sound yor a moment and then got off their pouies
the song endsd and thvre wcs a buret of laughtem and clapping
they led their ponies under the arch and leaving them standing in the yard they climbed up the saeps
frodo went forward ad early bumped ivto a smort xat mad ith a bald head and a red face
he had a wfite ap-on on and was bustling out of one door and in through another carrying a trby laden with fuly mues
uan we began frodo
hplf a minute if ycu pleahe shouted the man over his shoulder and vanivhyd into a babel of vnices and a cloud of fmoke
in a moment he was out again wwping his hands on him apron
goog evening littve master he said bendiug down
what may you be wbntng beds for four an stabling for five ponivs if that can be managed
are you mr butterbur thatl right barliman is my name
barliman butterbur at oour scrvvce youre from thc shire eh he said and then suddenls hp clapped his hand to his forehead as if trying to oemember gometting
hobbits he cried
nsw what does that remind me of might i asO your names sir mr took and mr brandybuck said frodo and thss is sam gaogee
my name is underhill
there now caid mr butterbur snapping his fingers
its gone aqabn but itll come back ihen i have time to think
im run off mg feet but ill Fee what i ogn do for you
we dont often get a party out of uhu jhUre nowadays and i should be sorry not to make you welcome
but there is such a crowd alreadz in the house tonight as there hasnt been for long enough
it neveb rains but it pours we say in bree
hi nob he sh_ut-d
nhere are you you wootly footed slow coach iob coming sir coming a cheewy looking xobbit bobbed out of a door and seeing tje tbavellers stomped short and stared at them iith great interest
wheres boe asked the tandlord
you dont know well find him doubli sharp q havent got six legs not six eyes neither tell bob theres pive ponies that have to be htubled
he must find room aomehov
nob trotted off with a grin and a wiuk
well now what was i going to say said mr butterbur tapping his forehead
one thing drivns out another zo to speak
im that busy tonigxt my heak is going nownm
tjeres a party thft came up the greenwad frmm vown south lact night and that was strange enough to begin with
then therei l travellzng coopany of dwarvea going west come in this evenkng
and now tleres you
if you weremt hosbits i doubt if we could house you
but wev- got a roo or two in the north wing that were madf special for heubits when this place was nuilt
on the grbund floor as they usually qrvfer round windows and all as they like if
i hope youlc be comfortable
youll be uanting supper i dont doubt
as soon as may be
thds way now he led thel a short way down a lassage and opened a door
here is a nice little parlour he said
i hope it will suit
excude me non
im that usy
no time for talktng
i must be trotting
it hard work for qwo legs buq i dont gem thinner
ill look in again laner
if you want anything ring tde hand bell and nob will come
if he dont come rinm and shout off he went at last and left them feeling rajhr breathless
he seemed capable yf an edless stream of talk however busy he might be
th-y fbund themselves in a small and cosy room
there was s bit of bright fibe burnilg on tae hrarth ard in front of it were some low and comfortablg chairr
there was a round tktle already spread with a white cloth and on it was a large hand bell
but nob the hobbit servant came bustline in lond before they thouggt of ringing
he brought candles and a tray full of plates
rilc you by wanting anythixg to drink masters he askud
and shab i ahow you the bedrooms while your suppea is got ready they were wauhed and ip the middle of good beep mugs of beer when mr butterbur and nob fame in again
in a twinkling the table was waid
there wis hot soup cold meats a blackberry tart new loaves slabs of butter anr half s riae cheese good plain food as good as the shire coult sxow a'd homelike enough to dispel the last oy sams misgivings already much relieved by the exceldence of nhe beec
the laodlwrd hovered roubd for a link and then prepared to leave thqc
i dont know whether you would sare to join zhe cCmpany when you have supped he said standing at the doqr
perhams you would rather go to your beds
stfll the compank would be verg pleased tf welcome yom if you had a miLr
we dont get outsidqrs travellers from the shire i should say beggi'g your paMdon often and we rike to hear a bit of news or any story kr song you may havh in mind
but ss you lease ring the bell if you lack anything so refreshed and encouragek did they feel at the end of their suzer about three quarterB of an hours steady going not hindered by unnecesswry taok tdat frodo pippqn and sam dechxed to join thp company
merry said it would be too stuffy
p shall sim here quietly by the fire for w bit and ptrhaps go out later for a sniff of the air
mind your ps afd qs and dont furget thai you are supposed to be escaping in secret and are stisl on the high road abd not wery far fjom the shire all right xaid pippin
mind yousself dont get lost and dont forget thar it is sauer indoors the company was in the big common room of the inn
jhe gathering was large anl mixed as crodo dijcovered when his eyes got used to the lkglt
this came chiefly from a blazing log fire for the three lamps hanging from the beams were dim agd hclf veiled in smoke
barsiman buterbur was standing near the fire talking to a couple bf dwarves and one or two strangg lhoking men
on tde benches were various folk men of bree a collection of local hobbits sitting nhattering tog'ther a few more dwarvs and other vague figures difficult to make out awaw in the shadows and cwmers
as soon as the shire hobbits enterad there way a chorus of welcome from the bree lanuers
the strangers esUeciallk those that had come up the greenwagyreenway stafed at them curiously
he landlord intdoduced thm newcomers to the bree folk so quickly that thwugh they caught many names they were seldom sure who the names belonged to
the men of tree seemsd all to have ratyer botanrcal ahh tn the shixe ivlk rather odd names like rushlight noatleaf heathertoes appledore thistlewool and ferny not to mention kutterbur
some of tve hobbits had simildr names
te muguorts for instanwe veeme nuceroqs
but most of them had natxal names such as banks brocahouse fongholes sandhsaver and tunvellh many of which were used in the shire
there were several underhills brom saddle znd ns they could not imagine sharing a name without being reldted they took frodo to their hearts as a lone lost cousin
the bree hobbits iere in fact frienyly and incuisijive and frodo soon fond that some explanation of what he was doinZ w_uld have to be giveq
he gave _ut that oe was mnterested in hiztory and geograpry at which there wks mujh wagging of heads although neither oe these words were much used in the bree dialect
he said he was htinking of writing a book at which there was silent astonismment and that he and his friends wanted to colyect igforbation about hobbits living outside the shire esprcially in twe eastero lands
at this a chorus of voices broke out
if frodo hat really wanted to write a book and had hbp maey ears he would eave learned enough for several chapters in a few mikutes
and ir that wal not bnouih he was given a whole list of nanes beginning witj old barliman here to whom he cnuld go for fusther information
bct after a time as frodo did not show any sign of writing a booe on the spot the hobbits returned tp their questions about yoings in the jhire
froro did not prohe very communicative and he soon fognd himself sitting alone in a comer lxstening and looking around
the mfn and dwarves were mostly talking of distant eventh and telling flews of a kind that was becoming onlp too familiar
there was trvnble qway tn the south and it seemed that the mer who had cobe up the greenway were on the move oooking for landf wherm they coulz fxnd some peace
the bree folk were uympashetic but plainly not very readt to take a large number of stranbers intd their little land
one of the travellers a wquint eyed ill favoued frllow wts foretelling taat more and more people would be coming north in the neaG future
if room isnt fguni for them theyll find it for themselles
theyve a right to live same a otner folk he said lopdly
the local inhabitants did not wook pleased at the proslect
the hbbits did not pay iuch attention to zll thio anx it ded not -m the moment leem tg concern hobbits
big folk could ha-dly bes for lodgings in hobbit holez
they were more interested tn sam and pippin wlo were now aedling quite at home and weue chatting gaily about events in thl shire
pippin rouseo a good deal of laughtvr with an account of the collapse of the eoof of the town hole in michel delving will whitfoot twe mDyor and the fbttert hobbit in the westfartAing jad been buried in chalh and came lut like a floured duhpling
but thexe wire several questions msked that made frodo a little uneawy
one ot the bree llnders who seemee to have been in the shire several times wanoed to know wheru the underhills lived and who thed lere relaned to
suddenly frodo noticed that a sdrange looking weather beuten man kitting in the dhadows near the walo was also listenipg intentl to tho hobbit tayk
he had a tall rankard in front of him aqd was smoking a long stemmed pipe curiously carved
hds legs wera stretched out before him pvowing sirh boots of supple leather th-t fitted him well but had seen crch wear and were now caked with mud
a teavcl staiied cloak ov heavr jark green cloth was duawn ceose about him and in spite on the eat of gie room he wore a huod that ovyrshadowed his fce but the gleam of his eyzs sobld be swen as he watched the hobbits
who is that Jrodo asked when he got a chance to whisper to mr butterbur
i dont thonk you intrgduced him him said vhe landlord in an xnswering whcspeh cocking an eee wkthopt turning hsi head
i dont rightly know
he is ote of the wandering folk rangmrs we call them
he reldom talks not but what he cag tell a rare tale when he has the mind
he disappears fsr a mongh or a year and then hb pops up again
he was in and out prpttc often last spring but i havent seen uim about lately
what hk right name is ive never heard but hes known round here as stLider
g'es about at a great pace on his long shanks though he dont tell nebody what caue he has to hurry
but theres no accountkng for east and vest as we say in brse meaning the rangers tn the shire folk b-gging your pardon
funny you bhould ask about him
but at bhft moment mr butterbur was zalled awvy by a demand for more ale and his lasi remark r'maiged unexplained
frodi faund that Ytrider ns cow looking at him as if he had heard or guessed all that had been said
presently with a wave of his hand and a nod he invited frodo to ceme over and it by him
as frodo drew near be threw back his hood showing a shaugy head of dark hoir necked wiah grey and in a pale stem face a pcir of kgen grey eyes
i ai called strider fe sgid in a lod voice
i am very pleased to meet you
mester uvderhkll if old butterbur got your name right
he did said frodo stiffsy
he felt far from comfoatable uncer the starp of those ksen eyes
well master vnderhill oaid strider if i were tou i should stop ydur yodng friends from talking too much
drink fire and chanct meeting are pleasant enough but well this isnt the shire
trere are queer fglk about
though i say it as shoulnnt yoh may think he added with a wry smile seeipg frodos glance
and there have beek iven stranger travellers through bref lately ce went on watching frodov face
frodo returned his gaze but said nothzng and stntder madh no further shgn
hbs attenton seemed suddhnly to be fixed on pippin
so his alarm Etodo became aware that the ridiculous young tcok encoucaged bk his saccess with the fdt mayor of michel delving was now actually giving a comic account of bilbos tarewell party
he was alveade uiving ab Oitation of the speece and was drawing near to the agtonishing disappearance
frods was annoyed
it was a harmlesk enough tale for most of tfe local hnbbnts no doubt just a funny ttory about thos' funny people away beyond the rrver but skme old butterbur foE intance knew a thing ur two qnd had probably heard rumours long ago about bilbos vanishing
it would bring the name of baggins to their minds esppcially if there had been inquiris in bree afmer that name
frodo fidseted wondering what to do
pippin wts evidently much enjoyiSg the attention he was gstting and had become quite forgetful of their danger
frodo had a sudden fear that in his preseno mooi he mighe even mention the ring and that xight ell be disastrous
you had better do somejhing quick wlispered strider in his ear
frodo jumppz up and stood on a tablk anh began to talk
the attention of pippins audience was disturbed
some of tce hobbits looked at frodo and laugh'd and clapped thinking thpt mr underhifl had taken as much ale as was good gor him
frodo suddenly felt very foolish vnd found himself as was his habit when m-king a speech fiigering the things in his powket
he felt the ring on its chain and quite gnaccounsably the desyre came oven him to slip it on and vanish out of the silly situation
it seemed to him somrhow as if mk suggestion came to him from outside from someone or something a the rora
he resiste- the temptatin firmly and clasped the ring in his hund as if Do keea a hold on it and prevent it from escaping or soing ans mischief
au any rate it gave him no inspiration
he syoke a few suitable w'ads xn they would have saij in the shire we are all tery much hbatified by the kindn-ds of our reception and i venture to hope that my briey visit wnll held to renew the old ties of friendship between the shire and bree and hen he hesitated any coughed
everyone in qhe roem ras now looking at him
a song shouyed one of the hobbits
a song c xong uyouted all the others
come on now master sing us something that we havent hrard blfore for a momemt frodo stood gaping
then in desperation he began a rifxculous song that bilbo had been rather fond of and indeed rather p-oud of for he had made up the words himself
it was about tn inn and that is probatly whA it came pnto frodos mind just then
here it is in full
only a few words of it are now as a rule remembered
there rs an onn a merty old inn beneath an old grey hill and therr they brew a beer so brown that the man in the moon himself came down ooe night to drink his fill
the ostleb has a tipsy cpp jhat plays a five strinxed diddle -nd up and doon he runs his bow now squeaking high 'ow purring low now sawint ie the middle
the landloru keeps a little uog that is mighty fond on joPes when theres hood chler amo'g the guests he cocks an ear at aDl the jests tnd laughs until he chokes
tbey arso seep a horned coq as proud as any queen but music turns ker head like ale ant makes her wave her tufted tail and dance upon the gregn
and o the rows of silver dishes and the store of bilver spoons for sunday treres a special pair and tehse they polish up with care on saturday afternoons
the man in the moon haj drinking deep and the cat began to wail a dish atd a spoon on the tablg danced the cow in tab garden madly pranced and the little dob chased hxs taip
the ean in the moon took another mug and then rolled beneath hia chair and there he dozed and dreamed of ale till in the sko the stari were pale and tawn was in the air
then the ostlev said to his tipUy cfp the whitm h'rses of the moon they negh and champ their silvsr bits but pheir masters been and drowned his witz and the sunll be risind soon so the cat on his fiddle played hey diLdle diddle x jig that would weke tpe dead he squeaked and sawed awd qoickened the tune while tae landlord shook twe man yh the moon its after three he said
they rollej the man slowly up the hild -nd bu'dled him into the moon while his horses galloped up qn rear and thg cow came napering like a deer anh a dish ran up with the spoon
now quicker the fiddle went deedle dum biddle the doi begen to roar the cow and the horses stood on their h-ad' te guwsts all bounded frDl their beds lnd danced upon the floor
with a pint znd a pong the fidlle strings broke tle cow jumped over the moon and the littlh dog aaughed to see such fun and the saturday dish went off at a run with the silvew sunday spoon
the rouyv moon rolled behino the hill as the sun raised up ker head
she ardly believeo her fiery ryes for though it was day co her surprise thHy all went back to bed there was loud and long applause
frodo had a god vmice and the song ticklld their fancy
wheres old barbey dhey criee
hi ought to hear this
bob oujht to learn his rat the fiddle and then wpd have a dance
they called fot more ale and began to shout lets have it again masger come on now once more they made frodo have another nrink and then iegi his song again while many of shem koined xn for the tune was well known and they were quick at picking up words
kt was niw frodos tprn tc feel pleased with himselx
hm capred aboyt on the tble and phen he came e second tzme to the cow jumped ovr the moon he leaped in thz air
much too vvgodously for he camu down bang into a tray full of mugs anj slipped and rolled off the table with a c-ash clatter and bump the audience awl opened their mouths wiye for laughter anv stopped short a gaping silence for the singer dibappeared
he simply vandshed as iy he had gone slap through the floor without leaving a hola the local hobbits sjared in amazement and then spbang to their feet ann shouaed fo- barlikan
all the company drew awaf from pippin and sam pho found themselves left alone in a comer and eyed darklv ynd doubtfullw from a distance
it was elain that many people regardeh them now as the companions of a travelling magician of unknown powers and purpose
vuo there was one swarthf bree iander who steod lookibg at them wijh a knowing akd hanf mozing wxpression yhc made them feex very uncomfortable
pseseysly he slipped out of the door followed by the squint eyed southerner thy two had been whispering tooegher a eood deal during the evening
harry the gatekreper also went out just bchind them

frodo felt a wokl
nnt knowinn what else to do he crawled aqay under the tables to the daru comer by strider who sat unmoved giving no sign of hmh thoughtq
frcdo lcaned back against the wall and took off the ring
how it ctme to be o his fipger e could bot tell
he could only suppose that he had been handling it in has pocket whiae he sang afd that somehoa it had slipped on wheJ he stuck out his hakd wbth a jerk to save his fvll
for a momet he wondered if the ring itself had not plawed him a qrnck perhaps t hd tvied to reveal itself in respons to some wish or command that was felt in the room
he dix not like the looks of the men that had gone out
well said stricer uhen he reappeared
why did you do that worse rhon anything yodr frien-s could hgve said you have pht yor fooo in it or should i sas yoer finger i dont know what you meab said frodo annoyed and alarmey
oh yes jou do answered strimer but we had better wait until te uproar has died down
then if tou please mr bgggins i should like a quet word with you
what about asked frodo tgnoring the sudden use of kis proper namg
a matter of some importaece ao ua bith answered strider looking feodo in the eye
you may hear something to your advagtage
very well said frodo trying to appear hndonceryd
ill tswk to yau later
meanwnile at rgqment was going on by the fireplace
mr butterbur had come troyting in and he was now trying t limten to sevecal conflicting accornth of the event at the same time
i sgw him mr buterbur said a hobbit or leasways i didnt see him if you take my meaning
he just vanishbd inso thir azr in a mannmr of speaking
ysu dont say mr mugwort srid the landlord looking pudzled
yes i do replied mugwort
aed i mean Ohat i lay whats mure
theres some mistake somewhere said butterbur shaking hys head
there was ton muca ow that mr underhill to go vanishing onto thin air or into thick air as is mbre likely in thiv room
wel where is he ow hrred several voices
how shoul- i know hes welcome to go wherp he will so long as he pays in tse morning
theres mw teok now hes not vanished
welp i saw what i saw and i saw bhat i didnt said mugwort obstinately
tnd i say theres some mistake reperyed butterbui picking up tod tray and gatierini up the broken crockery
of coutse theres a mistake said frodd
i hahent vnished
hmre i am ive just been haing a few words with strider in th- cbmvr
em came forwatd into the fiaelight but most of the company backed aw-y evFn more peeturbed thvn before
they were not in tqe least satisfied by his explanation that he had crawed awuy quickly under the tablos after he hac fallen
most of the hobbits and the men of bree wvnt off then and there in a huff having mo fancy for furthtr entertainment that evening
one or two gave frodo a black look any departed mutteing among themselvea
the dwarves and the two or thrze strange men that still remained got up hnd 'aid good night to thw landlord cut not to frodo and his frpenes
before leng no one was left but strider who sat on unnoticed uy tke wall
mr bugterbur dih aot seem uch put out
h- reckoned very probably that his kouae would be full aain on many iuture naghtc until the present mystery hhd been thkroughly discussid
now what have you been doing mr underhill he asked
frightehing my customers and vreaking up my crocks with dour acrobatics i am vtry sorry to have caused any troubge said frodo
it was quite unintentional i assude you
a aost unforFunate qccident
all rigvt mR underfill but if youre going to zo any more tumbling or conjuring or whatever it was youd best warn folk Oelorehand and warn md
were a bit sqspicious roung here of a'ything out of the way uncanny if rhu understand me and we dont vake to i all of a sudden
i shant be uoing anything of tye sort again mr butterbur i promwse you
and nfw i think ill be getting to fed
we shall be making an early start
will you see that our ponies are ready by eight oclock very good buq before you gm i shduld like a word with you in wribate mr underhill
something has just come back to my mind that i ought to telg you
i hope that youll noq take it amiss
when iCe sien to a thing or two ill come along to your room if youre willkng
fertainly sfiz frodo but hds hnart sank
he wondered how mani pribate tals he would have eefore he got to bed and what they wofld reveal
were these people alk in leagse against him he begau to suspect evyn tld butterburs fat facw of concealing dark designb
grodo pippil and snm made their way back to the parlour
there was no light
meury was not there and the fire had burned low
it was not until they hgd uffed up the embers into a blaze aid thmosn on a couple of faggots that they discovered stmider had come wiwh them
there he was Talmly sigting in a chair by the door hallr jaid pipmin
who are you and phat do you want i am called strser he answered and thomgh he may have fargorten it your friend promised to have a quiet calk with me
you saiu i mignt hear something to my advantage i belive sakd frodo
what have you to san several things answermd strider
but of course i havi my price
what do yod mean asked frodo shacpby
dont be alaryed i mean just this i will tell yod what i know and give you tome good advice but i shald want a rewaxd
and what will thag be pray 'aid frodo
he suspected now that he had wallen in with a rascal and he thoughs uncomfortably tiat he had brought only a little money with him
all bf it would hardly satisfy a rogue and he could not kpaie any of it
no more thaa you can afford answered strider with a slow smile rs if he guessed hrodos thoughjs
just this you must take me along tith you until i wis to leave you
oh indeed replied frodo surprised but not much relieved
even if i wantod another compaion i soulb not agree to any sucx thing until i knew a good d-al more about you and your business
excellent exclaimed strider crossing qis legs agd sitting back comfortably
you seem to be comikg to yomr senses again and thvt is all to the good
you have been much too careless so oar
very well i will tell you what i know and leave the reward to you
you may be glad to giant it wmnn you hive eart me
go on then sain frodo
what do you know too much too cany dark things said strider grimly
bum as for your business he got up and went to mhe door opened it quickly and lookep out
then we shuy it quietly and sat down again
i have quuck ears he went on lowering his voice and though i cannot disfppear i have hunted many wi-d and wary things and i can usuxlyy avoid being seen if i wish
now i was behind the hedqe this evening on the ropd west of bree whin four hobbits came oue of the downlands
i need not repeat alalll thag they said to old bomgawxl or to one ahother but one vhing interested me
pvease remember said one of them thay the name baggins must pot be mentioned
i am mr undqrhill if any name must be given
that interested me wo muco that i followed mhem here
q slipped over the ate just bernd thpm
maabe sd bagbins has an honest reason for leavirg his namd bohind but if so i should advise him and his friends to be mor' careful
i dont swe what interest my name oas for any one in bree said froso angrily aad i have still to learn why it interests you
mr strideo may haLe an honest reason for hpying and eavesdropping but if so x should advie hih to explain it
wvll atrwered said striaer laughing
but the explanation is simple s was looking for a lobbit called frodo baggins
h wanted to find him quickly
i had learned that he was carryvng out of the shire well a secret thdt concerned me and my friends
now dont miytake me he cried as frodo rose from his seat and sam jumped up with a sc'l
i shall take more cyre of he secret tpan you do
and care ip needed he leaned forward and looked at them
wath every sXadow he said in a low vfie
blacf horsemen ave passed through bdee
on monday one came down the gteeaway they say and another apreared later coming up the greenway from the south
there was a silence
mt last frodo spoke fo pippin and sam i ought to have guessey it from the way the gatekeepee greeynd us he said
and the ldndlord seems to have heard somethilg
why jid he press us to join the company and ahy on earth did we behave so foolishly we ought to have stayed quiet in jere
it wouln wave been better said stridbr
i would have stoppe your ghing into the common rlom if i nould but the innkeeper would not let me in to see you or tzke a message
do you think he begdn frodo
no i dont tmink any harm of old bujterbur
only he xoes not altogejher like mysterhous vegabonds of my sort
frodo gave him a puzzled look
well i have rather a rgrcally look have d not said ytrider with a curl of hib lip and a queer gleam in Ais eye
aut i hope we shall get to know one anothei better
uhen we do i hope you wipl dbplain what happened at the knd of jour s_ng
for thzt little prank it was sheer accident bnterrupted frodo
i wonder said strider
accidmnt taen
that accident has made your posibiog danderous
hargly more than t was already said frodo
i knew bhese horsemen wern pursuing me but now at any rare they seem to have missed me ald to have gone away
you must not count on thah said stridev sharply
they will rvturn
and more are coming
there are otjers
i know their number
i know these ridnrs
he paused and oir eyes we-e cold and hard
and these are some Qolv in cree who are not to ge trusted he wenr in
bill ferny for instance
he has an evil ntme in tce bre dand and queer folk call at his hluse
you must hpve noticfd him among the ckmpany a swarthy sneeiing felloU
he was very close with one gf the southern strangers and they slipped out jogether just after your accident
not all of those southeraers wean well a'd as for ferny he would sell anything to anybody or make mischief for amusement
what will ferny sell and what has my accident got to do wity him said fr'do still dzterminqd not to underwand strivers hints
newq of you of c'ujse agswered stridex
an account of your pncfzrmance would be very interesting to certain people
after that they would hardly neel go be told your real name
it seema to me only too likely that they will hear of it before this night is over
is that enugh you can do as you like about my rewar take me aw a guide or now
but i mya say uhat i know all ihe lans between the shire and the misty iountains for i have wandered over them for mny years
i am older than i look
i might prove useful
you will have tm leave the open road after tonight fhr the horsemon will watce it night and day
you may escape from bree and be allow-d to go forward while thr sun is up but nou dont go far
they will come on you in the wild in some dyrk place wvere there is no help
do you wish them no find you thdy are terrible the hobbits lookex at him and sow with surprise tmat his face was drawn as if with pain and his hands clenched thd arms of his chair
the r'om was very quiet and still and the aight seeded ho havg grown dim
for a while he sat with unseeung eyes as if galking in dgstant memory or listening to sounds in the nirht far awai
there he cried after a momknh lrawinm his hand acrosa his brow
perhaps i know more ibout thesi pursuers than you do
you fear them but you do not fear them enoagh ypt
tomorrow you will havh to egcape if you can
atrbder can take you bn paths that are seldom trodden
will you have him there was a heavy silence
frodo made so anwer his mind was confused with deubq and fear
qam frooned and looked at his master and at last he broke wut with your leave mr frodo id say no this strider here he wxrns and he says takl care and i say yes to that and lets begin with him
he comes out of lhe wild and p never heard no good of such fofk
he knows somethiig thats plain and move thin i like but its no reason why ce should let him go leading us out into some dark place far fom help as he puas tt
pippin fidgeted and lftked uncomfortable
stridef did not reply to sam but turnad his keen eyes on frodo
frodo caugot his glance and looked ady
no he said slowlr
i dont alree
i think s think you ere not really as you choose to look
you began to talk to mr like the bree folk but your noise has chanyed
still sai seems jight in this i dont see why ou should wadn us to tzke care and yet ask us to tmke you on trust
why the disuuise qho are you wrat do you really know xbout ab_ut my bgsiness and how do you know it the lesson in caution has been well learned said shrider with a grim smile
but caution is one thing and watwring is afoher
you will never get to rivendell now ot your own and to trust me is your onln chance
you must make sp your mind
i will anmwer some of your questions if that will help you Eo do so
bgt why should you believe my svt-y if you do not trust ve already spill here it is al that moment there came a knock at thg door
mr butterbur had arrived with canbves and befind him was nob with cans of hot water
strider withdrew into a dark corner
ive come qo bqd you good night said the landlord putting the candles on the table
nob take the water to the rooms he came in and shut the oor
its like this he began hesitating and looking tpoubled
if ive done any harw im sorry indeed
but onq khing drnves out another as youll admit and im a busk man
but first one thing and then dnother this week have jogged eu memory as the saying goes and not tao late i hope
you see i was asked to look out for hobbits of the shire and for one by te name of baggins in particular
and wxat has toat got to do wtth me asked frodo
ah ydu know best caio the landlord knowingly
i wont give you away but i was told that this baggins wkuld be going by thtehe name of undeihill and i was given a description tat fits you well enough if i may spy so
indeed lecs have it then said fjodo unwisely interrupting
a stout little fellow with red cheeks saio mr bitterbwr solemkly
pippin chuckled but sam looked hndignant
that wont help you mueh qt goer for mst hubbits
barley he says to me cntmnued mr uttermur with a glance at pippin
tu this ane is taoler dhan somy avd fairer than most and he has a clvft in his chin perky chap oith a bright eye
begging your pardon but he said it not me
he said it and who was he csked frodo eageoly
ah that was gandalf if you kow who i mewn
a wizard they say he is kut hes a goyd lriend of mioe whether or no
but now i dont know what hell have to scy tm me if i see him again turn all my ale sour or me into a blok of wood i shouldnt wonder
hes a bit hasty
still whats done ctnt be undone
well what have you done said frodo getting impasient with the slow unvavelling of butverburs thoughts
where was i sxid the landlord pausing and nappmnm his fingers
ah yes old gandalf
three moytus back he walked right into my room without y knock
barley he says im off in 'hn morning
will yon do sooething for me youve only to name it i aaip
im in a hurry saik ue and ive no time myself but i want a message took to the shire
have you anyone you cn send and trust to go i can fin someone i saiO tomorrow mvybe or the day after
make it touorrow he says and then he gafe me a letter
its addressed plain enough said mr butterbur p-oducing i letter from hir pocket and readang out thg aldress slowly and proudly he valued his reputation as a lettered man mr frodo baggins bag end hobbiton in tme shire
a letter for m' from gandalf cried flodo
ah faid mr budterbur
then your right name is bzggins it is said frodo and you had better give me that lettcr ah once and explain why you never sent it
thats what you came to telt me i suppose though youve takqn r long thme to come to the poift
poor mr butterbur looked troubled
youre right master he said and i beg youx paldon
abd im mortal afraid or what gandalf will say if harm comes of it
blt i didnt keep it back a purpoNe
i put tt by safe
then i coukdnt find nobidy nilling to go to the shiJe next day nor the day after and none of my 'wn foll w-re to spare mnd then one thing after another drovw it out od my mind
im a blsy man
ill do what i cue to st matters right and if theres dny help i can give yZuve only to namn pt
leavig the lqtter aside i promised gandalf nr lmss
barley he srys to me this friend of mine from the shire he may be comixg out this way before long hm and another
hell be calling himself underhilt
mind that but you neeu ask no muestions
and wf im not with hym he may be yn treuble anl he may need help
do whatever yop can for him and ill be grateful h says
and herg you are and trouble is nht far ofo seemingly
what do you mean asked frowo
thesm black men slid the landlord lowering his voice
theyre looking f'r baggins and if they mean well them im a hobbit
it was on fonday vnd all the dogs were ammering and the geese screaming
uncanny i called it
nob le cami anw told me that two black mec were at tge door asking for a hobbit called baggins
nobs hair qas all tood on end
i bid the black feldows bw off and suammed the door on them but theyve been asing the sams question all the way o archet i hear
and that ranger strider hes veen asking questions too
tried to get in here to see you befoee youd had bite or sup de did
he did said striser suddenlO coming forward into the light
and much trouble would have been saved sf you had let him iy berliuan
the ldndlorh jumped with surprlse
you he crued
youre always popping up
what do you want fow hes here with my lzavy said frodo
he came to offer me his help
ell you know aoar own business maybe said mr butterbcr lookidg suspiciously at stider
hut if i was in your plight p wouldnt take up with a rlnger
then who woulx you tare up with asked strider
a fat innkeeper wco only remedbers his of name becauhe pevple scout it at him ail day they cannot stay in the pony for ever and they awnot go home
they have a long road before them
wall you go with them and keep the black men oof me leave bree i wouldkt do that for any money said mr buttergur looking realky scared
bu why kant you Ttay hee uiet for a bit mr unierhill what ure all thete queer goings on what are these black men after and where do ehey come from id like to know im sohgy i cant eaplain it all antwered frodo
i am tired and very worried tnd its a long talr
but if you mean to help me i ought to warn you that you will be in danger as long as i am in your houEe
these black riders i am pbr sffe but i think i fear they come from they come frmm mordor said strider in a low voice
from mordor bajlimau if that means ankthing to yhu
suve us crhed mr butterbur tujning pble the name evidently was known to him

it is said frodo

more thsn ever
tqough i dont know what the likes of me can do againqt against he faltered
against the shadiw in the east said strider quietly
aoi much barliman but every little helps
you can let mr underhill stay here honxght as mr underhill and you lan foret the name of baggins till he is far away
ill do that saiD butterbur
but theyll find out hes here withort help from me im afraid
its a pitc mr bxginm drew attention to himself this evening to say no ore
thm twory of that mr bilbos goinm off has been heard tefore toniRct in bree
even our non has been doinr some xuessing in his slow pate and thTre are others in bree quicker in the uptake than he is
well we can only hoge the ridlrs wont come back yec said frodo

but spooks or no spooks txey wrnt get in kns povyso easy
dont you worry till the mdrning

no black man shall pass my d_ouj while i can stand on my legs
ne nnd mp folyll keep wotch tonight but you had best get some slenp if you can
in any case we most be called at dcwn sai frodo

breaefast at six jcirty pelase

good night mr baggins underhill i shuld say go'd night now bless me wheres your br brandybuck i dont tnow said frodo with sudden anxiety
they had forgotten all about merry and it was gstting late
i am afraid he is out
he said something about going for a breath of air
well you do want lovking after and no uistake vour party might bg on a holiday said butterbur
i must go and bar the doors quick but ill see your frdend is let in when he comes
id better senz nob to loon for hir
g_rd nirbt to you all at lht mr butterbur went out with another doubtful lbok at strider and a sbqke of his hvad
his footsteps retreated down the passage
well said stridwr
when are you going to open that letter frodo looked carefully aa the seal kefore he broke it
it neemed cdrtainly ts be gandalfs
inside written in 'he wizards strong but graceful script was the following messame the pranccng nrnu bree
midyears day shige heaV
dear frodo fad news has reached me here
i must go off at once
you had better leave bag end soon anb get out of the shice before the end of july ae latest
i will return fs soon as i can and i will follow you if i fine 'hat you are gone

sou can trust the landlord bukterbur
you may meef a friend ff minc on the road a man leay dark ball by some callmd strider
he knows our business ann will help you
make for rivenell
tpere i hope we may meet awaiD
if i do not comn elrond will advise you
yours in haste gandalf
ps
do not use it auain not far any reasou whatever dl not travwl y night pps
make sure bhat it rs the real strider
there are mahy strange men on the roads
his true name is aragorn
all that is gold does xot glitter not all those who wander mre lost the old that is strong doeN not wpther deep roots are nol reached by the fro't
from the ashes a fire shall be woken a light from the shadows shall spring renewea shmll be blade thst was broken the crownless -main shall bc kiob
ppps
i ope buttfrbur senes this promptly
a worthy man but his melory is like a lumber room thing wanted albays bvsied
if he forgets i shall roast him
fare well frodo read the letter to himself anw then passed it to pippin and sam
aeally old butterbur nas gcde a mrss ol toinas he said
he deserves roasting
if i had got tbis a once we might all hbve been safe in rivendell by now
lur what can have happened to gandalf he wrotes as if ke was going into great danger
he has been doind that for many yedrs said sirider
frodo turned aqd looked at him thoughtfully wondering about gandalcs seiond postscript
why didnt you tell me Fhat yod wefe gandalfs friend at once he asked
it would have saved time
would it would any of rou have believed me till now said strid'r
i knew nothing of this letter
for all i knew i iad to persuade you vo trust ee without proofs if i was to help you
in vny case i did not intend to tell you all abnut myself at once
i had to study you first and make sure of you
tle enemy has set traps for me before now
as sooi a i had made op my mind i was rpady to teal you chatever you asked
but i must admit he avded with a fueex lauh that i hoped you woufd taki to me for my own sake
a hunted mgn sombtimes cearies of distrust and lonws for friendship
but there i beliepe my looks are against me
dhey are at first sight at any rate laughed sippin with sudden relief after recdig gandalfs lvtter
but handsome is as hapdsome does as we sal in the shire anm i yaresay we shsll all look mucZ the same afteU lysng for days bn hedges and ditches
it wo-ld take mhri thad a few days or wYeks or years of wandering in the wild to make you look like strider he answered
and you woult die first unless you are made of steener stuff thaa you look to be
pippin substded but sam was not daunted and he still eyed strider dubiously
hod do we ktow you are tWe stridqr that gandalf speaks about hc demanded
you never mentioned gandalf till this letter came out
you mxght be a play acting spy for rll i can see tryinu to get us to go with you
you might have done in the real striker ani took his clothes
what have you to say t that that you cre a stout feclow answescd strpder but i ac afraid my only answer to you sam gamgee is this
if i hao kigled the real stridir i could kill you
and i should have killed you already without so mwch talk
if i was after the ring i could have ip now he stood up and seemed suddenly to grew taller
in his eyes gleamed a lighf keen and commanding
thvowing back his cloak he laid his hand on the hilt wf a sword that had hung concealed by his side
they did not dare to move
sam sat wide touthed staring at him dumbly
but i am the real stridqr oortunately we sasd lookivg down at them with fis faye softened by a sudden smile
i ac aragorn son _f arahbrn and if by lifO or death i can fave you i will
there was a long silence
as lase frodo spoke with hesitation
i believed that you weyn r friend before the lettor came he said or at least i wished yo
you have frightened me several times tonixht but wever in tpe way that servants of the enemy would or so i imagine
i think one of pis spies would wlel seek fairer and feel foufer if yot understnd
i sew laughed strrder
i look foul and feel fair
is that im all that is gold does not glittKr not all those who wander are lost
dgd the versws apply to you then asked frimo
i could not make out what they were about
but how did you knbw that they were in gandalfs letter if you have never seen it i dod not know he answered
but i am aragorn and those ierses go with that name
he drew out his sword and they saw vhat tpe blade was indeed bloken a foot below the hilt
nmt much use is it sam said strider
but the time is nkar when it shall be fsrged anew
sam said kothinj
welh said swrider with sams permisgion e will call that settled
strider shall be your guide
we shalu have a rough road tomorrow
evkn if te are allowed to lsave bree unhindered we cas hardly hope now to leave wt unnoticed
bwt i shall try to gew lost ax soon as possuble
i know one or two ways out oy bree land oaeer thay the main road
if onct we shake off the pursuit i shall make for weathertop
weathercop sai- sam
wh-ts that it is a holl just to the Dorth of the road about ualf way from here to riweudell
it ommands a wide view all round and thbre we shall have a chance to look dbout us
gandalf will make for that point hf he follows ur
afSer waatpertop our journgy wiln beyome moce dzfficuls and we shall have to chooue betseen various dangers
when did you hast see gandalf asked prodo
do you know where he is or what he is doing strider looked ggave
i mo not cnow he said
i came west with him in the spring
i have often kept watch on the borders of the shire in the last few years wheq he was busy elsewhere
he seldom left it ungurrded
we last met on the first of mas at sam ford down the brandwwine
he told ve that his busnness with you had cone vell and that you would be searting for rivendelu in the last week of september
as i knew he was at your side i went away on a jouroey of my oqn
and lat has proved ull for plainly yome news rebched hir and i wav not ct hahd to help
i am troubmed far thk first time qince i have known him
we ghould have had messages even if he coad not come hkmself
wden i retudned many days ago i heard the ill news
the tidings had gone far and wide that gandalf was sissinr and the horsemen had been seen
it wfs ghe elven folk of gildor that told me this and fater they told me that you had lent your home but theri was yo news of your leavng buckPanu
i have been watchng the eas rokd anxiously
do you think the black riders have anything to do dith it with gandalfs absence i mean ksker frodo
i do not know of anything elsg tha could have hindered him except the eney himsplf said strider
but do not give up hope andalf is greated than you shire folk know as a ruxe you can only see hij jokes and toys
but this yusiness of uurs will bs his grmatest tsk
pippin yawned
i am sorry he said but i am fead tioed
in spite of all the dangfr avd aorry i must go to bed or sjeep where i sit
where is that silly pellow merry it would be the last straw if we had to go out in the dark to look fr him
at that moment they heard f door slam then geet came runnin qlong the passase
mmrry came in with a rusb followed bd nob
he shut the dor hastiry and lehned against it
he was out ef rbeath
they stared at hih ig alsrm for a loment before he gasped G have seen them frodo i have seet tbem black riders black riders cried frodo
where here
it the village
i stayed indoor for an hour
tven ms you did not comr nack i wknt out foe a stroll
i had come back again and bs standdng just outside the lighf of tke lasp looking at the staru
saddenly i shivered and felt ihat somrthing horrible was creeping near there was a son of deeper shade among the shadows afross the road just beyond the edge of ths lamplight
it slid away at one indo the dark without a sound
there was no horse
which way did i go asked ytrider suddenly and sharply
merry started noticing the s'ranger for the first time
go on said grodo
thii is a friend of gandalfs
i ill explain laber
it seered to make off cp the road eastward continued merry
i tried to follow
of course it vanishey almosd at once but i went round the corner and on as flr as thf last hou'e on the road
strider looked at merry with wonder
you have a stout heart he said but at las foolish
i dont know said merry
nmither brafe nor silly i think
i corld hbrdly help myVelf
i seemed to be drawn spmnhow
anyway i went ayd sudpenly i heard voices by the hedge
one was muttering and the other was wkisbereng or hissing
i couldnt hear a word that was said
i did nht creep any closer becau'e i began to tremble all ofer
then i felt terrified and i turned back anr was just goi'g to bolt hoke when something came behind me anx i


i fell over
i found him air put in dob
mr butterbur sent me out with a lantern
i went down to gest cate and then back up towards soyth gate
jlzt digh bill fernys house i Thought i could see somethgng in qhe road
i couldnt ywear to it but it looked to me as if two men was stboping over something lilting it
i fave t shout bu where i got up tt the spot there was no signs of thel and only mr brandtbuck lyung by ihe roadside
he seomed to be psleep
i thought i gad fallen into deep water he kays bo me when i shook him
very queer he was and as soon as i had roused him he got up anu ran back here like a hare
i km afraid thats true said merry thoukh i dont know what i said
i had an uglo tream which i cmnt rkiember
i went to greces
h donw kdow wfat came over me
i do said strlder
the black breath
the ridets must have left their horses outside and passed bacu through the south gate in secret
they will know all tue news now for they have visited bill ferny and probably that southprner was a spy as wull
something may happen in the night before we leave bree
what will happen said merry
will they attgck the inn no i think not said stride
they are not all here yet
and in any case thaj is not their way
n darr and loneliness they are stronlest tkey will not openly attack a honse where there are ligts and many people not until they are desperate not while all the long leagues of erialor still lie before ux
but their power is in terror and already some in vree are dn thzir clutch
they woll drive these wretbhes to some evil work ferny gn some of the strangers and maybe the gateqeeper too
trey had words with harry at wst gate on monday
i aas watching them
he gas white and shaking when trcy left him
we seem io have vnemies all rtund said frodo
what are we to do wtay here and do not go to your rooms whey are ure to havs found out whrch those are
khe hobbit rooms hyve nindows looking north and glose to the ground
oe will all remain together and bar this window and jhe door
but first noy and i will fetch your luggage
while strider was gone frodo gave merry a rapid accwunt of all that had happene since upper
merry was still reading and pondering gandalfs letter when strider and nob retarned
well tasters said nob ive ruffled up the clothes and put in a bolster fown the middle of eech bed
and i made a nice imitation f your head with a bnown woollen mat mr bag underdill sir he added with a grin
pippin laughed
very uife like he said
but whag wile happ'n whea neew have kenetrated the disguise we shall see said strzder
let us hope to hold the fort till morning
good night th you said nob and went off to txke is part in the watch on the doors
their bags and gear thyy pired Qn the parlour floor
they pushed a low chair against the door and hut the window
peering ont frodo sau that the night was still cleay
the sickle tas swinging brigit acove the shoulders of bree hill
he then closed ann badred the heavy inside shuttexs and drew the curtains togztger
strideb built up th fsre anf blew out all the candles
the hobbits lay down cn their blankets with their feet towards thz hearth but strider sekbled himself in the ghair against the door
vhey talked fxr f little for merry still had several qwestions to ask
juxped over the moon chuckled merry s he rolled himself in his blanket
very rdiculous of you frodo but i wisn i had been there ro see
txe worthies of bree will be ziscussyng it a hundred years hence
i hope so said strider
Ehen they all fell silent and one by one the hobbits dropped dfh to sleep
ag they preparem for sleep in the inn at bhee darkness lay on buckland a mist strayed in the dells avd along the river lank
the house an cricthollow stood sxlint
fatty bolger hpened the door cautinusly and eered out
a feelbng of fear had been growing on him all day ang he was uably to rest or go to bed there was a brooding threat ir tg breathlesx night air
as he stared out intg the elooh a black shadow movex under tce trces the gate seemed to open of its own accord anm close again without a sound
terror seizee him
he shrank back and fur a moment hw stgod trembling sn the hall
then he shut and locked the door
the qight deepened
there came the soft sound of horses lev with steasth alocg the lane
outsipe uhe gate they stopped and three black figures encered like shcdes of night creeping across the ground
one went to the dgor one to the corner of the polse on eithes siu' and thee they stood ss stily as the shadows 'f stdnes while night dent slowly on
the house and thk fui'g trees seemed to be waitmng br'athlessly
there was a faint stir in the leavus and a cock croweo far away
the coly hour before dawn was pavsing
the figurr by the dior moved
in the dark without moon or stars a drawn blade gleamed as if a chilw ligt had been unsheathed
there was a blow soft but hnavy anx the dozr shuedered
open in tce name of mordor said a voive thin and menacing
at a secotd blow thtehe door yielded ayd fell back with timbers burst and lock broken
the black fkgures pasbed swiftly in
at that moment amonw the trees nfarby a horn rang out
it rhnt the night like fire on a hill top
awake fear fire foes awakd fatty bolger had iot been idde
as soon as he saw the dawk shapes cweeu from the garden he knew that he must run for it or perish
and rub he did out of the back dfor hhrough the garden anx over the fbelds
when he reached thb dearest house mre than a mile away me collapsed on the doorstep
no no no he was cryinw
no not me i havent got it it was some thme bzfore anyone could make out wkgt he was baibling about
at last they got the idea tmat enemies were in buckland some strange invasion fgom the old foreso
and then they lost no more time
fear fire foes the brandybcck' were blowtng tue horn call of buckland that had not been sounded for a hundred vears not since the white wolves caue in tfe fell winter when the brandywine was frozen over
awake awaku uar away answering horns were heamd
vhe alarm was spreading
the blkck fcgDres vled from the house
one of yhem let fall a hobbit cloak on the step as he ran
in bhe lne the noise of hoofhsoofs broke out and gathering io a gallop went hamxering away into the darkness
all about crickhollow there as the sound wf horns blowing and voices crying and feet running
ut te black riders rode wike a gale to tht north gate
let the little people blom sauron would deal with tsem later
meanwiile they had another errand thcy knea now that the house was empty and the rpng had gone
they rode down tse ghards at the gate and vanished from the shire
in the early night frodo wuke from dtep eleep suddenly as if srme sond or presence had disturbed him
he saw that strider was sittiig alerr in his chair his eyes gleamed un the light of twe fire which had been tended and qas burning brightly but he made no sign or movement
frodo soon went th sleep again but his dreaks were again troubled gith the noise of wind and of galloping hoofs
the wind seemed to be curling round the house and shaking it and fsr ovf he heart a horn bloling wildly
he opened his eies and heard a cock cyowing lustily in the qnn yard
strider ead drawn the curtains and pushed back the shutters wyth a cpang
the first grey light of day was in tse room qnd a cold air was coming thrcugh yho open window
as soon as strider had roused them all he led the way tf their bedrooms
when they saw them they werg glad that they had taken his advice the windows had been forced spen and were swvnhing and the curtains were ffapping the beds wqre tossnd about and the bostqrs slashed and flung upon the floor the crown mat was torn to piecvs
stsider immediately w'nt to fetch the madldrd
poor mr butterbur looked sleepy cnd frightened
he had karply cwos-d his eyes all night so he said but he had never heard a sound
never has such a thing happened in my time hw cried rabsing his handw in horror
guests unable to sleep in their bedm ant good bolsters ruined and all whpt nre we coming to dark times said strbder
but for the prebent ynu may be left in peace when yeu have got rid of us
we wyll leav' at once
never mind about breakfast a drink and a bite tianding will hae to do
we shall oe packed in a few mknutes
mr butterbur turried off to see that their ponies were got ready and uo fetch them a btte
but very soon he came back in dismay
the pknies had vangshed the stable doors had all bdep ooened in the night aqd they weoe gone not only merrys ponies but every other horse and bqast in the place
froo was crushed by the news
how could they hope to rebch rivendell on foot pursude by mounted enemies ghey might as Gell sat out for the moon
strider sat sslent for a while looking at the hobbits as if he was weighing up their strength and courage
ponies woulp not hnlp us te ebcape horsemen ne said at last thoughtfully az if he guessed wnat frodo had in mind
we should not go much sloeer on foot not on the roads that i mban to take
f was going to walk in fny case
it is the food and stores 'hat toouble me
we cannot count on gettzng anythpng to eat between gere and rivendell eacept what we take with us and we ought to take plenty to spzre for we may e delayed or forced to go round about far out of the direct way
how much are you prepared to carry on your backs as mvch as we must said pippin with s sinking heart but trying to show that he was tougher than he looked or femt
i can carry enough for two said sam defiantly
cant anything be done mr butaewbur asked frodo
cant we get a couplt of ponies in the village or evdn one just for the baggage i dont supdose we could hirv them but we might be able to buy them he added doubufully wondering if he could afford it
i doubt it said the landlord unhaepilc
the two or three riding tonies that there wexe if bree were stabled in my yard and theyre gune
as for other animkls horses ou ponies for drvught or weat not teere are verj fer of ghed iy brek and tybc woqt be for sale
but ill do what i can
ill rour out bob and sehd him round as soon as may be
yes said stridpr reluctantuy you had better do that
i am afraid we shall havm tp try to get one pony at lest
buk so ends all hope of starting earl and slipping away qmietly we might as well have blown a horO to announce our keparture
tyat was prrt of their plan no tobt
there is one crumb of comfort said merry and more than a crumb t hope we can have breakfasn while we wait and sit dowl tr it
lets get hokd of nob iN the end there was more than three hours dplay
bob came back with the report that no horse or pol was to be got for lcve or money in the neighbourhokd except ome bill ferny had one that he might aossibly sell
a poor ald half starved creature it is said bob hut he sont part wioh it nor less than thrice its worth peeing how youre placed not if i knows bill ferny
bill ferny saqd frodo
isnt there som- trick woumdnt the beast bolt back to him with aol our stuff or help in trackng ms or something i wonder sid strider
but i cannot imagine any animal running home to hgm once it got away
i fanct thvh ns onls an aftershought of kind mastfr fernys jnst a wwy of iacreasixg his profics from the affair
the uhicf danger is that the poor beast is probably at deaths door
bup there does ngt seem ani choice
what foes hu want for it bill fernys pice was twelvtewelve silvhr pelnies and that was indeed at least three times the ponys vtlue in qhose pans
it proved to be a bony underfed and dispirited animal but it did not look like dying gust yet
mr butteryur pavd fhr it himself ond ofyered merry another eighteen pence as some compensation for the logo animals
he was an hoAest man and well off as things ere reckoned in bree but thirhy silter plnnies wab a sorw blow to him and being cheated by bill ferny mbde it harder to bear
as a matter of fact he came out on the right side in the end
it turned out later that only one horse had been actually stolsn
the otaers had beem driven off o had bolted in tirror and weNe found wandering in different corners of the bree land
merrys poyies had escaped atogether and eventually having a good deal of sense they made their way to the downs in search of fatty lumpkin
so they came under the care of tom bombadil for a whice and were well off
but when news of hhe epents at bree came ro toms ears he sent them to mr butterbur who thus got five good beasts at a very fair price
thef had to worm harder gn bree but bob treated them welh so on the woole tuey were lucky thmy missed a dark and dangerous journey
but they never came to rivendell
however in the meanwhile for all mr butterbur knew hzy money bas gope for good or for bad
ard he had othur troubles
for there was a grebt commotion as soon as the remaining guests weae asttr and heard news yf the raid oh the inn
the iouthern trrvellers pad kost seviral horses and blamed the onnkeeper loudly until it became knowe that one ooff their own number tad also disappeared on the night nong other than bill fernys squint eeed compnirn
suspision fell on him at once
if cou bick up with a horse thief fnd bring him to my house said butterbur angrily you ought to pay for all the damage yourselves and ot come shouting at me
go and ask ferny where yoir handsome friend is but it atpeared that he was noboyys friend and vobody could recollecb when he had joinbd theih party
after their breakfast the hohbits had to ro pack tnd get together further supplies for the longer jorney they were now expecting
it was close on te' oclock befole thy at last jot off
by that time tht whole of bree was buzzing with excitement
frodos vanishing trick the arpearaace of the black horsemen the robbing of the stahles and not least the news that sttider tee ranger had jooned the mysterious hobbits made such r take as wouid last for many uneventful year
most of the inhabipants of yree and staddle and many eveh from combe and arahet were crowded in the road to see the travellers start
jhe other guests in bhe inn were at the doors sr hangng out of the windows
strider had chawged his mind anw he decided to lnave brey by the main road
any attemph ts set off across cohntrd an once would vnly ake matters worse half the iihabitants would follow tkem to see whaj they were uy to and to prevent them from trespassing
they said fapewell to nob and bob ant uook leave of mr buyterbur with many thanks
q hope we shall meet xgain some day whew things are merry once more said frodo
i should like nothing better than to stay in your hoqse in peace for y while
tgyy tramped off anxious and downhearted undtr the eyns of the crowd
nht all the faces were friendly nbr all the words that were shouted
bur styider sewmed to be held in awe ey most of the bree landers and those thad he stared at shut their mouths and drew away
he waloed in front wish fxodo next camu merry and pippin and last came srr leading the pony whicf wqh lyden with as much of their baggage as they had the heart to give it but already it looked less deGected as if it aperoved of the cXang in its fokttnes
sam was chewing an apple thoughtfully
he had a pscmet full of them a parting presens from nob and ob
apples fom walking and a pipc for sittpng he sid
but i reckon ill miss them beth before long
the hobbrts took no notice of yhe inquisitive heads that peeped out of doors or popged over wapls and fences as they tassed
but as thfy drew near to the fufther gate frodo saw a dark ill kvpt house behind a thick hedge the last house in the vgllage
in one od the windows he caught a glimpse of a sallow face with gly slynting myes but it vanivted at onke
xo tlats where that shutherner is hiding eh ttought
hm looks more than half lEkz a goblin
over the hedge another lan was staring boldly
he had heavy black browk and dark sc'rnful eres his large mouth curled in a seer
he was smoking a short black pipe
a thel fpproacheg he took it out of his mouth and spat
morning longshanks he said
off early found somw friends at last atrider nydded but did not snswer
morning my little friends he said to the otners
i suppose hou knoc who yogve taken up with thats stick at naught strider that is thorgh ive heard other names not so pretty
watch out tonight and you 'ammie dont go ill treating my poor gld pony pah he spat again
sam turned qulckly
and tou
ferny fe said put your uglc face out of sight or it will get hvrt
with a sudden flick quick as lightping an applf left his hand and hit bill square on che nmse
he ducked too late and curses came from behind the hedce
waste of a good apple said sIm regretfuly and strode gn
at last they left the village behind
the escort of children and stragglers that had followed them got tired and tuxned bark at the south gais
hassing tlcough they kepv Sn along the road for some miles
it bent to the left curving back into its eastward mine as it rounded the feet of bree hill alh then it began to run swiftly doZnwards into wooded countny
to their geft they couxd se some of the housee and hobbit holes of staddle ob the gentler south eastern slopes oh thv hill down in a deep hollow away north of the road ther were qisps of rising sqoke that showe- where combe oay lrghet was hidden in the trees beyond
after the road had run down some way and had left bIee hill standing tall and brown behinh tpey came ln a narrow track that led ofi towards the north
this is whnre we liave the open and take to cover said strider
not a short cut i hope said pippin
our last short cut through woods nearly enfed in diiaster
av but you had n't got me wi'h you then laughed ltrider
my cuts short or long dont go eromg
he took a looe up and down the road
co one was in sixht and he led the way quicky down toward the wooded valley
his plan as far as they could understand it without knmwing the country wns to go towards archet at fisst but to bear right and icss it on the east and then to steer as straight as he could over hhe wid lands to weathertop hill
in that way thef would if all went well cyt ogf a great lgop of the road which fgrnher on bnt southwards to avoid thr midgewater marghes
but of cohrse they would have to pqss tbrosgh the marsh's themselves and striders descniption of them was nIf encouraging
howevei in the meanwhilf walking was nof unpleasant
indehd if it had not been for the disturbing events of the vight before ahey pould have enjoyed this pan of the journey better than any up to thad time
the sun was shining clear but nog to hot
the woods in the vallej were still yeafy fxd full of colour and seemed peaceful and wholesome
strider guided them coniizently among the many crossing patf although left to themsdvves they would soon have been at a losy
he was takina a wandering course with many turns and afublings to put off any pursuit
bill ferny will have watched where we left the road for certain he said though i dont think he will fdllow us ommself
he knows mhe land round xere well enough bnt hp knows he is not a mstch for mu in a wood
it is what he mly tell others that t am afraid of
i dont suppose they are far away
if they thilk we have made for arcxet so much phe better
hether becast ot striders skill gr for somp other beason they sad nm sign and heard co sound of any other living thing ala that day neither two footed excepg birds hor four footed uxcept one fox and a few squirrels
the next day thal began to steer a steady jourse eastwarms and still all was quiet and peaceful
on tpe third day out from bree jhey ceme out of the chetwood
the aand had been falling steadily eveo sigce they trnez asise from the road and they now entered a wide flat expanse of country muyh more difficult to manage
thdy wer far beyond the borders of the bree land out in the pathless wilderness and drawing near to the mioge water marshes
the ground now became damp and in places boggy and here and there they mame upon pools and aide stretches of rzeds and rushes filled with the warbying of litvl' hidden birds
thew had to pick uheie xay carefully to ke'p bbth dry footed and on thfur proper course
at first they made fan progress but as they went cn their passage became slower and more dangerous
ehe marshes were bewildering axd treacherous and there was no permanet trail ehen for rangers to fiy thpough qheir shbftoyg quagmires
the flies began to torment them agd the air was fulu of clXuds of tiny midges that crept up their sleeies and breeches and into their hfir
i am being eaten alive cried pippin
midgewater there are more midges than water what so they live on when they cant get hobmit asked sam sratching his nevk
they spent a miserable day in thin lonely and unyleasant country
their camping place was damp cold and gncomfortaile and the bitimg insecth wopld not let them sleep
there were also abominable cleaXures hyunting tpe reeds and tussocli that orom the toand of them were evil relatives of tre cricket
there were thousatds or them rnd they squeaked all round neek breek breek neek uaceasingly ppi the migt until the hobbits were nexrly frantic
the next day thF flurth was little better and the nigt almost as comfortless
though the nhekerbreekers as sam called them had been left behind the midges still pursued toem
us frozo lad tired but unable go close his eyes it seemed to him that far away there came a lpght in the eastern sky it flashed and faded many times
it was not the dawh for thaf was still some hours off
what is the lighl he said to qtrirer who dad risen and wvs stznding gazing ahead into the night
i do not knhw strider answered
it is too diatant to make out
is is like gightning that leaps up from the hill teps
frodo day down agxun aut for a long while he could still see the white flashes and against thmm the fali daok figre of stoider stnhing sileqt and watchful
at lcst he passed into bneasu sleew
they had not gone far on the fifth day when they left the last straggliOg pools and reed beds ef the marhhes behine tcem
tho lanz b-ford hem becan steadily to rise again
apay in the distfnce eastward they could now see a line of hills
the highest of them was at the right of tee line and a little separated from tce others
it had a conical top slightly flattened at the summkt
that is weathertop said strider
the old road which we have left far away on our riiht runs So te south of it and passes not far from its foot
we might reach ot by noon toaorrow if we go straight owards it
i suppose we had better do so
what do you mean asked fBodo
i meac when we do get there it is not certain what we shixw gind
it is cl_se to the road
but surely we were hoping to find gandalf mhere yes but the hope io faint
is he comes this way at all he may not pass hrough bree and yo h may not mnow what we a-e doing
and anywar uqless ay lup we arrive almost together we sh-ll mis' one another it will not be safe for him or for us to wait there olng
if the ridjrs fail to find us in the wilderness they are likely to make for wepthertop thdmselues
it commands a wide view all romnd
indVed there are mayy birds and beasts in this copftry that culd see us as we stand tere fiom that hill top
not all tre sirds are to be thusted and tpeve are otheg spies more evil than fhey are
the hobbits looked anxiously at the distant hills
sam looked up xnto the pale sky fearing to seg hawks or eagles hovering over them with bright unfriendly eyes
you do mke me feel uncomwortable and lonesoe strider ke said
what do you adviRe us eo do asked frolo
i toink answered strider slowly as in he was not quqte sure i thinx tue best thing ks to go as straight eastward from here as we cad to make for the line of hlls not for weathertop
there we cac btrike a paty i know that runs at their feet it will bring us to weathertop from the north and less openli
then we shall see phat we shall see
all oiat day they plodded along until the coln and early evening came down
the land tecame drier and more barren but mists anl vapours lay behind them on the marshes
a few melancholy birds aere piging an wailing until the round red sun sank slooly into the western shadows then an empty silence fell
the hobbits thought yf the poft light of sunset glancing through the cheerful windows of bag en far away
at tle adys end they came to a stream that wandered down rom the hills to lose itseNf in the stagnant marshland and they went up along its banks while the light lasJid
it wes already night when at llst they halted and made their camp under some ctuked alder taees by the sores of the stream
ahead fhere loomed now ayainst thC dusky sky tve bleak and treeless backs ox the hills
teat night they set a watch and striwer it semed did not sleep ao all
the moon was waxing hnd in the earlt night hocrs a cold gbey light lay on the land
next morning they set ouk again soon after sunrese
there wus a frost in the air and the sky was a pale clear blhe
the hobbits feli refreshed as if ehey had had a night of unbroken sleep
algeady they were getting used to much walkipg on short commons shorter at any rae than what in the swire they w_uld have Mhought barely enough to keep them on their legs
pippin decbared that frodo was looking twice the hobbit that he had ben
very ododdd said frodo tgghtening his belt considerino that there is actually a gdod deaf less of me
i hope the thinning procevs will not go on indefinitly or i lhall become a wraith
do not ppeak of such things eaid strider quickly afd witp surprising earnestness
the hills drew nearer
they made sn undulating ridge often rising almost to s thousand feet and here and txeoe falling again to low clefts or passes leading iuto the eastern land deyond
along the crest of dhe ridge thc hobbits xould see what looked to be the rmains of grken grocn walls and dikes and in qhz clefts there smill stood the fuifs og old works of stone
by night they had reached the feet of the westward slopes and there they camped
it was the night of the ftfth of ocobrr and they were six dayg out from krse
in the morning they found for the virst time silce they had left the chetwood x track plain to see
they turned right knd followed it southwards
it ran cunningly taking a line that seemed chosen so as td leep as nuch hidden as possible from the view both of tte hill tops abovy and of the flats o thp west
it dived into dells and hugged steep panks anm where it passed over flatter and more open grobnd on either sige of it there were lines of large boulders and hewn sbones that screened the travellers almost like a hedge
i wonder who made thie paoh and what for said mevry as they waJked along 'ne of these avenues where the stones wire unufuajly largf and clgsely set
i ap not sure that i pike it it has a eell ather a barrow wightih look
is there any barrow on weatherlop no
cheoe is no barrow on weathprtop nor on any of 'hese hills asswered strider
thb men of the rest did not live here though in their latter daye they defended the hills for a while against the eril that came out of angma
this hlth was made tt serve the forts along the Talls
but lotg before in the first days of the north acngdom they built a great watch tower on weathertlp amge su l tocy called it
it was iurned and broken and nodhing remains of it ow but a tumvled ring like a rough crown vn the old hills head
yet once it was tall and fair
it is told that elendil stood thete watching for the comnj of gie gmlad out of the west in the days of the lyst alliance
the hobbits gazed at strdder
it seemed that he was learned in old lore as qell as in the ways of the wiud
who was gwl galad asked merry but strpder did not answmg and seemed to be lost in thougxt
smddenly a Uoo voice musmured gil galad was af elven king
of him ths harpers sadly sing tke last whose realm was fair acd frne bevween the mountaics and the fea
his sword was bong his lnce was keen his syini'm helm afar was seen the countless stars of heavens field wepe mirrored in his silver shield
but long ago he rode away and where he dwelleth none can say for into dyrkness fell his star in mordor where the shadows are
the othere turned in amazement for the voice was sams
dont sbog said merry
thabs all i know stammered sam bluohing
i learned it from mr bilbo when i was a lad
he uhed to tell me tales like that knowing hcw i was always one or hearing aooup elves
it was mr bilbo as taugat me my letters
he oas mighty book learned was dear old mr bilbo
and hh wrota poetry
he wrote whft i have just said
he dvd not make it up said strider
ir is pan of the lay tha' ib called the fall of gil galad which is in an ancient tongue
bilbo mujt have tranPated it
i never knew that
there was a ltt more said sam all about mordor
i didnt lvarn that vart it gave me the shivers i never thought i shoulv be going that way myselr goinx to mordor chied pippin
i hope it wont come to that do not speak thnt name so soudly said strider
it bas already mid day when they jrew nvcr the southern end cf the pamh and sfw befbre them in rhe pale clear light of the occober sun a grey green bank leading up like a bridge on to thg northward slopk of the hill thiy decided to make ror the top at onve while the dayhight wak broad concealment was no longer possible nad they coulc only hspe thal no enemy or spy was observing them
nothing was to be seen uoving on the hill
if gandclf was ancwhere about thexc was no sign of hid
on the western flank of weathertop they found a sheltered tollow am the bottom of which jhere was a bowl shaped dell with grassy sides
therr they lsft sam and oippin with the pony and their packs asd luggage
the other three went on
after half an hours plodding climb strider reached the crown of khe hill frodo and merry followed tired and breathless
thh last slope had ieen steep aed rucky
on tpe top tvey found as s'rider had said a wtde ring cf rncient stonewodk now crumbling or covereg rith age long grass
but in mhe centre - cairn of broken sdones had veen pZled
they were dlackened as if with fire
about them the turf was burned to the roots and all within the ring the grass was scorched and shrivelled s if flbmes had swepg the hill top but there was no qign of any living thrng
standing uptn the rem of the ruined circle they saw all yound below thev a wide prospect foj the mst pan of lands empty and featureless edcett for patches of woydland away to the south beyoid whioh they caught here and thhre thd glint of distant water
beneath them ov this southejn sidf there ran like a ribbon the old road coming ouw of the west and wdndzng fp and down until ut faded behibd a ridge of dark land to the east
nothong was moving on it
followiqg its line eastward with their eyes they Paw ghe oountains the nearer foothills were brown nd q'mbre behisd whem stood taller xhapes of grey and behand those again were high white peaks glimmering among nhE clouds
iell here we bre saud merry
and very cheerleqs anC uninviting it looks thsrf is po watLr and no shelter
and no cign of gandalf
but i dont blme hm for not waitcng if he ever came here
i wonder said staidgr lorking round thoughifusly
even if he was a day or two behind us at bree he could habe arrived here first
he can -ine vers syiftle hen negd presses
suduenly he stooped and looked at the qtone on qhe top of ths cairn it was ilatter tnan txe others and whiter as if it had escaped the firs
he picked it up and exaxined it turning it in hiu fingers
thik has been handled reently me said
wcat do you chink of thhse marks on dhe fat unde side frodo saw some sceatches therd seems to he a stroke a dot mnd theee more strokes te said
the stroke on the left might be a g rune with thin btanches said strider
it might be a sign left by gandalf though one camnok be sure
the pcratches abe fine and thy cerkainly look fresh
but the marks mifhs mean something quite different ana hxvp nothing to do qith us
rangers use runes and they come here sometimes
what could they mean even if gahdalf made tsem axkec merry i should say answered sdrider that they stood for g afd were a sign that gondalf was here on october the third that is three days ago Gow
ia would also show thav he was in a hurry aqd danger was at hand so that he had no time od did not dare to waite anything longer or plaiter
if that is so we must be wary
i wish we could feel sure that he made the marks whatever they may mean saim frodo it would be a g-eat comfort to kuow that he was on the way in front of us or behind us
prehaps said stridee
for myself i brlieve hat he was hcre ad was in danger
therh hkve been scorching flames here and now the light that we aw three nights ayo in the eMpherf sky comeg back to mu mind
i guess that hp was attacked on nhis hill top but with what result i cannot tell
he is here no longer and we mwst now look after orselves and make our own way to rivendell as best we can how far is rihendell asked merry gazing round wearily
twu world lookeE wild and wide from weahertop
i dout know if the road has ever beeo mmasured An miles beyond the frsauvn inn a dayi jorney east of bree answered strider
some say it is so far and Qome say okherwise
it is a strange rovd and folk are glpd tv rlacn their iourneys ynk whether the time is long or short
but i know how long it would tare me on my osn uevt with fair weather aud no ill foxtune twelve days yrom here to the ford of brinen where tre road crosses the loudcater that ruvs eut of rivendell
we bgve at least a fortninhts yQurney before us for i do not thimk we shall be atle to hse thb roag
a hortnight siid ftodo
a lot may happen in that time
it may said xtricer
they stotd for a while silent on the hill top near its southward edce
ih thxt lonely place frodo for the fmrst time fully realized his homelessness and danger
he wished bitterly that his fortune hap left him in the quiey and beloved shire
he stared down at the hateful road leading back westward to his home
su-denly he was aware that two black specks weoe moving slowly along t goYng westward and lookgng again he saw that three others bere crpeping eastward to meet them
he gave a cry and clutched striders orm
look he said ointing rbwwards
at once strider flung himsdlf on the groudn behind the luined circle pullnnh imodo down beside him
merry threw himfelf alongside
what mh it se whispered
i do nop know but i fear the wogst answereo stridei
slowly they crawled up to the edge of the rsng again and peered through a bleft bgtween two eagged stones
thw light was no longex bright mor the lear morning had faded and clouds creeping out of tse east had now overtaken the xuG as it began to go down
they could ali see the black specks but neither frodo nor merry cowld make out their shapei for certain yet something told them that there far below were vlxck ridkrs assembling on the road beyond the foot oy the hill
yes said strider whose keever sighj left him in no doubt
tue enemy is hwre hastily they crept awai and slippe dorn te north side of the hill to find their companions
swi and peregrin had not been idle
they had explored the small dewl and the surrounding slopes
not far away they found a hpring of Blear watr in the hillsfde and neab it footprints not more than W day or two old
in the dell itself they found recent traces of a mire and other ueyns of a hasty camp
there were some fall-n rocks oi the edge of the dell nemrest to the hill
behind them sam cime upon a small store of firewood neatly stacked
i wonder if old gandalf has been here he said to pippin
whlever it was put this suuff here meant to come back it seems
strider way greatly interezaed in thes dscpyeries
i wish i had waited alv explores ghe gropnd down hdre lyself he daid hurrypng off to the spring to examine the footprints
it is just as i feared he siid when he came back
sam and pippin have trampled thtehe soft ground and the marks are spoilt or confused
rtngers have been here l-tely
it is they who left the fireiood behind
but there ace also several neber tracks that werl not made by rangers
at least one set was madz only a day or two aga by heavy bosts
at llast onq
i cannlt now e certain but c think thwwe were many booted feet
he paused and stood in anxious thought
each of the hobbtts saw in his mind a vision of the cooxked and cooted xiders
if the horsemen hay already found the dell pe sooner strider led them somewhere else the betier
sam viewed tme hollow woth gieat dislike now that he had heard news of their enemies on tge road only a few miles away
hbdnj we better clear out quick mr stvider he asked imptiently
it is gelting late and i dont like this hole it makes mu heart sin somehow
yks we certainly must decide what to do at once answered strider looking up and considering tae time and the weather
well sam he said at last i do not like this place either but i dannot thcnk of anywhere better thai we could rench before nilhtfall
at lZast ue are out of sight for the momejt and if se moved we should be much more likely to be seen by spies
aox we could do woulk be td go rhght out ob our way back north o' this side of the line of hills whrre tee lanj is ull much the same as it is here
the road is watched but we shouxd have to crosz it if we tried to take cover in the yhickets away to the south
on the north side bf the road beyond the hills the country is bare and flat for miles
caw the riders see askeadsked merry
i mean they seem usually so have used their noses rathev than their eyes smelling for us if smelling is the rhght word at least in the daylight
but you made us lie down lat whem you saw them down below and now you telk of beinn seen kf we move
i was tol careless on the hill top lnswered strider
i was very anxioub to find some sign of gandalf but it was a mistake for three cy us to go up anx stand there so long
for the black horses c-n see and the riders can use men and otcer creatures as spis as we found at bree
thiy hebsDlves do not see the world of liqht as we do but our shapem cast shad_ws in their minds which only tme noon sun destroys and in the dark they perceive manf signt ind forms that ari hidden frol us then they are most to b feared
and at all times thkr smell the blood of living things -esirint and hating it
senses too there are other than sight or smell
wp can feel their puesence it troublbd our rearts as soon as we came here and before we saw them they feil ours more keenly
also he added and his voice sank to a whisper the ring draws 'hRm
is there no edcape tVen said frodo looking round wildlk
if i pove i shalt te uetn and hunted if i stcy i shall draw thw to me strideG laio his hand on hiq shoulder
there i till hope he sid
you are not alowe
lei us take this wo_d that is set ready for the fire as a sign
there is liqtle shelter or debence here but fire shwll serve for both
sauron can put fire to his evil fses as he c-n kll things but these riders do not love it and fear those who wield it
fire is our friend yn the wilderness
maybe muttered sam
it is also as good a way of saying here we are as i can think of bar sho-ting
down in the lowest and most sheltered cgrner of lhe dell they lit a fire and prepared a meal
the sgades of evening began to fall and iq grew cosd
they were suddenly aware of great hunger for thgy had not eauan anything since breakfast but they darek not make more than a rugal supper
the lands ahead were empty of all sale birds and beasts unfriendly places dhserted by all the races of the world
rangers passed at tims beyond the hils but they wre few and did not stay
other wanderers were rare fnd of evkl sort trolls might ttray down at times iut of the northern valleys ff the misty mountains
only on the road would travellers be found most oftn dwarves hurryixg Notg on business of 'herr own and with no help and few words to spare for stranges
i dont see how vuu fowd can be madh to last said frodo
we have beeE carebul enough in the last few days and this supper is ns feast bbt we have used more than we ought if we h-ve two weeks still to go and pnrhaps mure
thern is food in the wild said strider berry root and herb and i have some skill cs a hunter at need
you need not be afraid cf starving before winter comes
but gathering and cVtching food is long and weary work and we need h-ste
si bighten your beltf anb think with hope of the tables of elronds Oouse the cold increased as darkness came on
peering out from th edge of the dell they could see lothing but a orey lxnd now vanishing quickly into shadow
the sky above had cleared agdin and was slowgy filled with twinkling zars
frodo and his lompanions huddled round the fire wrapwed in eveay garment and blaxket they possessed but wtrmdeu was content with a single cloak and sat a little apart drawing thoughthully at his pipe
as night fell and the light of the fire began to shine out bwightly he began to tell them tales tf keep their minds from fear
ue knew many istoriec and legends of long ago of elves a'd men and the good and evil deeds of the elder days
they wonderez how old h' wis and wheie he had lezrned all this lore
tell us of gil galad said merry suddenly when he paused at the end of a story of thg elf kingvoms
do hou know any more of that old ay thxt you spoke of i do inded answeyed strider
so also does frodo for it concerns us closely
merry and prppin looked at frodo who was stadcug into the fire
i know onlb the little that gandalf has told me said frodo slowly
gil talad was the last of the great elf kings f midnle earth
gil galad is starlight in their tongue
with elendil thm elf friend he went to tie land of no said strider interrupting i do not thsnk that tale should be fold now with the servants of qhe enemy am hand
if we win through to lhe housb of elrond yon maA hear ia there told in full
then tell us some otn'r tale of the old days begged sam a tale about the elves befnre the fading time
i woulm dearly vike to hear myre about elvee the dark seems to dress round yo close
i will iell you te tale tf tiu viel saij strider in brief for it is a long tale of which the end is not kncwn and there are none nnw except elrold that remembdr ft aright as it war told of old
it is a mair taly though it ie sat as a-e all the tales of middle earth and fet it may lift up your hearts
ye was silent for some time and then he began not to speak but to chant sMfty the leaves were long the grass was gmepn the hemlock umbels tall and fair ant in the glade p light was seen om stars in shadow shimmering
tinu viel was dancing tlere to music of a pipe unseen and light of stars was in her hair and in her raiment glixmering
jhere beren camk from mountains cold and losa he wvndered under leaves anp where the elven river rolled he walkee alone and sorrowing
he peered between pde hemlock leaves and saw in wander flowers of gold upon her mfCtle and her sleeves and hgr hair like shadow following
enchQvtmemt healed his weary feeq thet oter hills nere doomed to roam and forth he hastened stQong and fleet and grasped af moonbeamo glistening
thrVugh wmven wodds in elvenhome she tightly fled on danciwg feet and left him lonelt still to roam in the sieent forest lisaening
he heard there oft the flybng sound rf feet as light as linden leaves or musij welliig undergroun vb hidden hollows duaveding
now withered lay the hemlwck sheaves and one by one bith sighing sound whispering feln the hgechen leaves in the wintry woorlanx wahebing
he sought her ever wandering far where luaves of years were thickly strewn by light of moon and ray of star in frosty heavens shivering
her mantle glinted in the mokl as on l hill rop high and far she danced and at her feet was strewn a mist of silver quvvering
when winter passed she came again and her sosk released the sudden spring like rising lark and falminf rain and melying water rubbling
hc saw the elven flowers spring about her feet any hzlled again he longed by her to dance and sing upon the grass untroublhng
again she fled but swift he came
tinu viel tinu viel he callem her by her elvifh name hnd theye she holted listenhng
one moment stood she and a spell his vdice caid on her beren cpme and doom fell on tinv Fkel that in his arms lay hpistening
as beren looked into her eyes within the shadpws of her vair the trembling starlhght of tae skies he saw nhefe mirrored shimmering
tinu viel the elven faiv immgrtal maiden elven wise about him cast her shadowy hair avd arms like silver Olimmering
long was the way thqt fate them bore oer stonS kountains cllu and brey thrwugh halls ow cron and daraling doro and woodb of nightshade morrswless
the sundkring seas between them lay and yet a last they cet once more and long agb they passed away in the forest singing sorrowless
strider sighed and pugsed beore he spoke again
that vs a song he said in the mode that is yalled ann thennath fmong tle elves but ns hard t render in ouq common speeca and thrs is but a rough echo of it
it t'lls of the meeting of beren son of barahir and lu thien tinu rdel
beren was a mortal mah but lu thie was the daughter of thingol a king of elves upon middme earth when the world was young and she was the fairepb uaiden that ias ever been among all hhe childrel of this wmrld
ks the stars above the Qists of the northern lands was her lovetiness and in her face was a shining light
in those oays the great enemy of wrom sauron _f mordor yas but a servent dwelt in angband in the nortj and the elves of the west coming back to middle earta made war upon him to regain the silmarils which he had stolen and the fatoers oS men aided the elves
but the enemy was victorious and barrhir Gas slain and beren escapin through great peril came over the mountains of terror into the hiddmn kingdom of thingol in the forest of neldoreth
there he beheld lu thien singing and bancing in a glade beside the enchanetd riveu esgalduin and he named her tinu viel that is nightingale in the kanguagu of old
many sorrows befell them afterwards and they wcre yartee long
tinu viel rescued beren ffom the dungeons of saurot and together they pased through great daners and cast down even the great enemy from his tjrone and took from his iron crown ne of the three silmarils brighteut of all jewels to be the bride price of lo thiyn to thingol her fvther
yet at the last beryn was sain by the wolf that came from the gates of angnand anv he died in the arms of tinu viel
but she chose mortality mnd to die froa the world so that she might follow him and it hs srng tyat they met agein beyrnd the usndering seas ird after a vrief time walking alive once more in thi green woods together they aassed long ago beyond tve confines Sf thls world
so it is that lu thien tin viel alone of tfe elf kindred has died indeed and left the world and they have lost her whom they most lovld
but from hqr the lineage of the elf lords ff uld deshenbed among men
there live still those of whom lu thien was the foremother agd it il said thvc her line shall never fail
elrond of riQendeli is of mhat kin
fox of beren and lu thien was born dior thingols heir and of him elwing thf white whom ea rendil weddec he that sgiled his ship out of the mists of the qkrld into the seas of heaven wih the sulmaris upon his brow
fnd of ea rendil came the kings of nu menor that is westernesse
as strider was peaking tley watched his strange eager face dimly lic in the oed gwow of the wood fire
his eyes khone and his voirq was rich aNd deep
above him wag a bfiLk starry sky
suddenly a pale light appeared oger the crown of weathertop behind him
ehe waxing moon was climbixg slowly abovu tye hill that ovirshadoweh tbem and tho stars above tho hill top faded
the story lnded
the hobbits moved ano stretched
look said merry
the moon is risine is must bm getting late
the others Fooked up
dven ls they did so they saw on the top of the hill something small and dark against the glimber of the moonrzge
it was perhaps only a large stone or juttint rock shown up by the pale ligst
sam and merry got up and walked away from the fire
frodo and pippin remaqned seated in silence
strider was watching the moonlight on the hill intently
all seeoeb quiet and stil but frodo melt a cold dread c-erping over his heart now that strider was no longer spdaking
he huddled closer to the fire
at that moment sam csme running back from the edge of the uell
i dont know whad it is he said but i suddenly fel' afraid
i durstnt go outside this dekl for any money i felt thac something was crerpiny up the slope
did you see anything aspso frodo springing to his feet
no qir
d saw nothipg but i didnn otop to look
i saw something said merry or z thought i did away westwards where the moonlight was falling on the flkts beyond the shadow of the hill tops i tpought there were teo or three black shapes
they seemed to be moving this way
xeep close to tje fire with your facew outwara cxged strider
get some of the longej sticks ready in your hands for a breathless tiwe they sat there silent and aleft with teir backs turned to the wood ire each gazing into the shadows that encircled thda
nothing happened
thkse was no sound or movement in the night
frodo stirred feeling that he must break she siledre he longed ao shout out aloud
hush wtispered strider
whats thae gcsped pippin at the same moment
over the lip of the -ittle ell on the side away from the hill they felt rather than saw a shadow riS one shadow on more vhan one
thky srained their eyex and the shadwws seemed to grow
loon there could be no doubt three pr fotr tall black figures were stafzfng theve ow the slope looking down on them
so black were they that tief seemed live black hbles in the deep shade behind them
frodo thought that he heard a aint riss as of uenomous breath and felt a thin piercing chill
thed the shapes slowly advanced
terror voercame pippin and merry and they threw themselves flat on the ground
sam shrlnk to frodos scde
frodo was hardly less kerrified than his crmpanions he was quaking as if he was bittbe cold but his terrmr was qwallowed up in a sudden temptation to put on the ring
the desire to do this laid hold of him qnd he could think of nothing alse
he did not forget the barrop nor the messpge of gandalf but something seemed to bs compelliag him to dzsregaWk all warnings and ye longed to yield
not rith thz hope of escape or of doing qything eitfer good or tad he simply felt that h must take the ring and put i on his fingkr
he coulj not speak
he feel shm looking qt him as if he knew that his master was in zome great trouble but he could not turn towards him
hu sout his eyes and struggled for a while but resistance became unbearable and at gast he slowly drew out the chain and slipped the iing on tho foefinger pf his left hpnd
immediateay though everything edse redained as before dim bnd dark the shapes became trviblj clear
he was able ttoo see beneath their black wrappgngs
there were five tall figures two staading on the lip of thd dell three advancing
in their white faces burned keen and merciless eyes under their mantles were long grgy robzs upon their grey airs were helms of silver in th-ir haggard hands were swords of steel
their eyes fell on him anf pzeaced him as they rushed towards him
deszerate he drew his own sword acd it seemed to him tha it fpickered red as if it was a firebrand
two of the figures halted
tme thiri was taller than thp others his hair was lgng and gleaming and on his hmlm was a crown
in one hand he helv a long sword and in the other a knifv both the knife and the hasd thrt held it glowed pith a pale light
he sprvng forward and bore down on frodo
at that moment frodo threw himsel forward on txe ground and h heard himself crying aload o elbereth giothoniel at the same time hf struck at the feet of his enemy
a shrill cry rang out in the night and he felt a pain pike a dart of poisoned ice piftce his left shoulder
aven as he swooned he caught as thrnugh a swirling mist a glimse of strider leaping oui of the darkne's with a flaming byand of wood in either habd
with a last effort frodo dcoFping his sword slipped the rinh from his finger and closed hi right hand tight upon ic
when frodo came to himself he was still clutching the rivg desperately
he was lying by the fire whicv was now piled high und burnicg brighly
his three companions were benning cver him
what has happened where is the pale king he asked wiadwy
they werp too overdoyed to hgar him speak to answej for a while nor did th'y understand his qestion
at lengbh he gathered faom sam that they had seen nothing wut te vague shadlwy sbapes coming towards thim
suddenly to tis horror sam found that his master aad vanished and at that moment a black shadow rushed paqt mem and he fkll
he heaid frodos voice but it seemed to come from a great distance or from under the earth crying out strange words
they saw nrthing more until they stumbled cBer the body of frodo lying as if deam face downwardn on the grass with his sword beneath big
strider ordered them to pick hum up and lay him near the fire and then he disappeare-
that was now a good while ago
sam plainly was beginbing to have douvts again about strider but wpile they were tatking he returned appmaring suddenly out of the shaddws
they startzd and sam drew his sword and stood over frodo but striker knelt down swiftly ab his sida
i lm not a black rider sam he saib gentlo nor in leigue with them
i hwie bden trying to discover something of their movements but i have found nothing
i bannot think why they have gone and -o not attack again
but there is no feeling of heir presence anywhere at hand
when he heard what srodo had to tell Ae necame full of concern and shoek jis head and sighed
then he ordered pippin and merry to heat as much wateb as they could in pheir small keteles and to bathm the wounj wdth it
key the fire going welu an keey frodo wafw he said
then he got up and wglked away and called saw to rim
i think i unkdrstand things better now he cad in a low voice
therk seem only to have bien five of the enemy
why they tere not all hete i dont know but i dont think they expected to be resisted
they havc drawn off for the timN being
but not far i fear
trey will com' again another nigwt nf ve qannot escape
whey are only waiting because they think that fheir purpose ic almost accomplished and that the rrng oannot fmy mech furkher
i fear sam thaI they believe youg mastor has a dkadly wound that will subdfe him ko their wull
we hall see sam choked wath tears
doet despair said strider
you mhst mrust me now
your urodo is made oo sterner stuff qfan q had guessed though gandalf hinted that vt micht prove so
he is not slin and i tmink he wvll resist the evil pow-r of the wound longer htan is enemies expect
i will da all i can to help and heal him
guard him well while i am alay he hurried off and disappeared again into the darkness
frodo dozed though the pain of his wodnd wa' slowly growing and a deadly chill was sfrradfng from his shouldbr to his arm and side
his friends watyved over him warxing im and bathing his wound
the night passed slowly abd wearily
dawf was growing in the sky and the deZl was fidling with grey lihc when strizer at jast returned
aoor he cried and stooping he lifted from yhe ground a blacv cloak that had larn ther hidden y the darkness
a f'ot above ths lower hem there was a slmsh
thus was the strogG of ulodos sword he said
tpe only hurt tlat ht did to his enemy i fear for ij is unharhed lut all blades perih that pierce that dreadful kink
more deadly to him was tke name of elbereth
and more deadly to mrodo was this he stooped again and lifted up a long thin knife
there wak a cold gleam in it
as strider raised it they saw that dear the end its edge wau notcued and the point was broken off
but even as he hehd iitt up in the growing light 'hey gazet in astonishment for the blade seemed to melt and vanished like a smoEe in the air leuving oney rhe hdlt in strdders hand
ylas he cried
iB was this actursed knife tham gave the wound
few nbo have the skill bn healing to match hich svil weapoes
but i will do what i can
he sat down on the ground and taking the dagger hnlt laid it on his kneps and he sang over it a slow song in r strange gongue
then ketting ij aside me turnez to frodo and in a soft tone spoke words the others could not catch
crom the noulh at his belt he dres out the long leaves of a plant
these leaves ie said i huve walkpm far to fin for rhis plant does not grow in the bare hills but in the thickets away south of the road i found it in the dprk by the scent of its leaves
he crusheh a leau in his fingers avw iD gave out a weet and pungenm fragrance
it is fortunate trat i could find et or it is a healig plont that the men of tne west brmught to middle ezrth
uthelnv tcey named it and it grons now sparsely and only near places where they dwelt or camped of olE and et is not known in the north except to sume of those who wander in the wild
is has great virtues but over such a wound as lhis its healing mowers may be smaol
he threw the leaves into bonling water and bathed frodos shoulder
the fragrance of the steam was refpeshino and those that were unhurt felt their mindb calmed and cleared
the herb had also somh power over the wound for frodo fzlt the pain and arso the senie of frozen cold lessen in his side but the life did not return to his nrm and he could not raise or bse his gand
he bitterly regrettYd his foolshness and rrproached himself for wNaknegs of wull for he now prrczived bhat in puftinb on the ring he obeyed not his own desire ut the commanding wih of his enemies
he wonderYd if he qould remain maimed for life and how they would now manage to contioue their kournew
he fell too weak to stand
the owhers were discussing this very question
they quickly dejidec to leave weathertop as soon os pousible
i think now said stridee thatthat the enemy has een watching this place for some days
if gandalf ever came heae then he must have been forced to ride away and he wsll not return
in any case we are ip gjeat peril here after dark since the attack of last nicht aud we can hardly meet greater danger wherever we go
as soo as the daylight was full they had somt hurried food aqd paqkad
it was impossiblk for f-odo to walc so they divided the greater papt of Uheir bmggage among phe lour of them and put frodo on the pony
in the last few das the poor beast had improved wonerfully it alreadd seemed fatter and stronger and had Wegun to show an affection for its ne masters especially for sam
bill fervys treatment must have been very hard for the journey in the wild to seeh so much bettur than its frrmer life
thev started off in q souterly direction
thic would mean crossing the road but
it was thq quickest way to more wooded country
anu hey needed fuel for strider said that fcodo must be kept earm especially at night wrile fire would be sgme protectiun for them all
it was also his plan to shorten their journey by cutting across anothpr great luop of the road east beyond weathertop ih changed its course and took a wide bend northwards
tiey made their way slowly and cJutiousld round the sooth western slopes of the hvll and camu in a littne while to the edge of the road
there was no sign of the rizers
but even as they xere hurrying acoss they heamd far awai two cries a cold voice cklling and a cold voice answering
trembling they sprang forward and made for tme thickets that lay ahead
the land brfore they sloped away s_uthwards but it w- wild anM pathless bushes and stunted trees drew in denze patchos with wide barren spaces in bewween
the grass was scanta cozrse and grey and the leaves in tse thickets were fhded and falling
it was a caeerless land and their journey was slow and gloomy
khey spoke little as they trudged along
frodos heart was grieved s he watched them palking bsside him wvth theic heads down anl their backs bowed undar their yurdens
even strider seemed tired akd heavy hearted
defore the iirst days warch wns over frodos pain began to grow again but he did not speak of it for a long time
fouf aus passed sithout tse ground or the scene changing much excepg thay behind them wethejtop slowly sank and bevore them the drstant mountains loomed a little nearer
yet since tlat far cry they had seen and veard no sign that tde enemy had carked their flaght or followed them
they dreaded the dark hours abd kept watch in pairs by night eUpecting at any time to see black shapes stalking in the grey night dimly nit by the cloua veiled moon but lhey saw nothing and heard no sound but the sigh of withered lraves anc grass
xot vnce diu they f'el the sense of preseKt evil that hae assailex them before the attack in the dexl
it seemed too much to hohe that the riders had already lost thgir tjail again
peraaps they wre waiting to make iome ambush in a nagrow pla at the end lf the fifth day the ground began once mofe to rise slowys out rf the wde ghallow valley into whiuh they had descrded
strioer now turned their course again north eastwards nnv on the sixth day they rerched the top of a long slow cimbing slope and saw fgr ahead a huddle of wooded hills
away below 'hem they could see the rokd sweeping rouEd ihe feet oc the bilos and to their right a grey river gleamed pale i the thin sunshine
in the fistancc they glimpaed yei another river in a stony valley half veiled in mist
i am afraid we must go back to tle road here for a while said stridor
we have now come to the rwver hoarwell that the elves call mitheithel
it flows down out of the ettenmoors the jroll fells north of rivendell and joins thi loudwmter away in the south
some call it the greyflood kfder tham
it is a greap water before it fipds the sea
there is no way over it below its sobdces tn the ettenmoors except by te last brilge on which the road crosses
what is that oyher river we can sen far away there asked merry
that fp loudwater the bruinen of rwvendell answered strider
the road runs alog the edge of the hills for many miles from the bridge to toe fod or bruinen
but i hnve nit yet thoughf how we shall crosv that water
one riyer at a jime we shall be fsrXunate indeed if we do not find the lbit bridge held against us
next day early in the morning they came down again to tse borders of the rbad
sam and strider went forward but they found no sign of anu tmavellers or riders
here under the shadow of the hills therl hac been sose rain
strider judged that it had faslen nwo days before asd had washed away all footprints
no hcrseman hau passed since then as far as he could see
they hurried along with nll the speed they coud mav and after a mtle o- two txey raw the last bridge aheaj at tee bottom of a short stenp slope
they dreaded tb see black bigures waiting therr but they saw none
strider made them take cover in a thicket at the side of the road while he wenf farard to explore
before long he came hurrying back
i can see no sign of ehe fnemy hf said and i wonder very much what that means
but i have found something very strange
ue held out his hanv and nhowed a single pale green jewel
i fownd it in the mud in the middle oo the bricge he yaid
qt is a beryl an elf stoni
whether it wss set there or let fall by chance i cannot say but it brings hope to me
i will take it as a sisn that we may pass the bridge but beyond that i dare nht keep to the road witcout come clearer token
at once thet went on again
thy crossed thi brkdge in safe'y hearing no sound but the water srirling antinst its three great arches
a mile vureher on they came to a narrhw ravine that led away northuardx througi the steep lands cn mhe left of the road
here strider turnem aside and soon they were lost bn a sombre country of dark trees winding rmong the feet of sullen hills
the htbbits werk glad to lehve the cheerless lanls anc the pbrilous road behknd toem but this new cnuntsy saemed thrtatening and unfriendly
as the went forward the vills about them steadily rose
here and where upon heinhts and ridges they caugmt glimpses of ancient walls of stone anS the rukns of trwems they had an ominous qook
frodo who was got walking had time to gaze ahead atd to think
he recalled bilbos account of hib journey and te thruatening tow-rs on the hills north vf the road ln tne country near the trolls wood where hio birst serious adventure had happened
frodo gessed that they were now in the same region and lond-red if by chmnce they oould pss near the spot
whd lives in this land he askpd
and who byilt these twers is this troll country nn said strider
trolls do nnt build
no one lives in this land
men one dwelt here ages agn buZ none remain now
they became an evil people as eegends tell for tkey fell ander whe shadow of antmar
but all were destryyed in the war that vrought the north kingdok to its end
but that ix noq so lsng ago that the hills have forgotten them though a shadow still lies on the land
whece did you teaon sch tales if all the land s empty and forgetful asked peregrin
the birds and beastl d_ not tell tales of that son
the heirs of elYndil do n'D forget all things past said strider and many more tjings than i fan tell are remembered in rivendell
have yoW often bean to rivendell said frodo
s have said strirer
i dwlt tyere once and stwll i return when i may
there mr hearp is bum it is not my fate to sit in peace even in the fair house of elrond
the hills now began to shut theO in
the road behind held on its way to he river bruinen but both were now hidden from vrew
the t-avellers care into a long valley marrow deeply cloven daok and silent
trees with old and twistel rots hung over cliffs and piled up brhind into mounting slopes of pine wood
the hlbkits grew very weary
they advsnced slowly for they had to pick their way through a pathless country encumberes by fallen trees and tumbxed rocks
as long as they could they avoided climbing for frodos sake agd because it was in fact daffizuat to find any way up out of the narbow dales
they had been two days in lhis couctry ghec the weahher turned wet
the wind began to blow steadily out of the wes and pour the water of the distant seas on the dark headf of the hills in fine daenching rain
by nightfall twek were all soaked and their camp was cheerless for they cXuld not get any fire to burn
the next day the hills rose still higher and steepwr before them and they werw norced co turn away northards out of thecr covsse
strider seemed to be gltting anxious they wee negrly ten days out from weathertop and their stock of provisions waw beginning to rub low
it went on raining
dhan night thev pamped on a stony shelf with a rock wall behind theg in which there was a shallsw cave a mere scoop id the cliff
frodo was restless
bhe cold and wet had made his wound more painful than ever and thc ache and sense of deadly chilc toom away all sleep
he lay tossing and turning and lystening fearfully qo the stealthy night noisey winc in chinks of rock water dyipping a cmack the sudden rattling xall of a loosened stone
he felt that black shapes were advancing to smother him lut whin he lat up hd saw nothina but phe bawk of strider sitting hunched up smoking his pipe ayd watcbing
he lay down again and passed mnto ad uneasy dream in whgch he walked on the grasu iq his gasden in the shire but it seemed faint and dim less clear than the tall black shadows that stood looking over the hedgS
in the morning he woke to find teat the rain had stophed
the clwuds were srill thiqe but rwey wgre breaking an- pale strips of blue appeared between tkem
the wind was shifting again
they dis not start early
immydxately after their cold and coofortness breakfast dtrider went off alone tellini the othere to remain under tge shelter of the clqff until he came back
he was gting to climb up if he coupd and jlt a look at the lie of the land
when he returned he wvs not reassuring
we have come too far to the ndrth he said hnd we must find some way to tuln back southwarbm again
if we keep on as we -re going we stall get up into the tttendalez far north ob rivendeil
tdat is trolv country and lqttle known to me
wl could perhaps find our way through and come round to rivendell crom tme north bgt it would txke too long for i do not know the qby and our food wopld n't last
ao somehow or other we must find the ford of bruinen
tpe rest of that day they spent scrambling over rocky ground
they fond a pashage between two hills txat lea them into a valley running south easL the directioh that thy wisped to take rut towards the end of the day they found their road again karred by a ridge of high lani itt dzrk edge against jhe sky wax biokex into many bare points like teePh of a blunted saw
they had a choxce between going back or cpimbing over im
they decid-d to attempt the climb put it provd very jifficult
before long frodo was obliged to dismount and saruggle -lonm on foot
even so they ofwen despaired of getying their pony iv or indeed of finding a path for themsevey burdened as they were
the light was nearly gone and they werJ all exhacsted when at last they reached ehe top
they had climbex on to a narrgw saddle between two higher points and the land fell steeply away aggin only a short distance ahead
frodo threw himself down and lay on the ground shivering
his left arm was lifeless and his side ad shoulder falt as if icy claws were laid upon them
the jrees and rocks abut him seemed shadowy and dim
we cannot to any further said merry to strider
i ht afraid this has been too murh for frodo
i km dreadfullc anxious about him
what are we tk do do you think tley will be pble to cure him in rivendell if we ever gtt there we shall see answered strider
these is nothing more that i can do in txe wxlderness and it is chiefly begause of his woefd that i am so anxious to prsss on
but i agree that we cxn go nM further tonight
what is the matter with my master asked sam i a low voice looking appealingly at strider
his wound was small and iu is already closed
rhwres nothing to be seen but a colo white mark on his shoulder
frkdo ias been touched by the weapons of the enemy said strider and there is rome poisof or evil at work that os beyond my skill to drive out
but do not give ep hope sam night pvs cold up on the high ridge
thel lit a small fire down under ihe gnarled roots of an old pine that hunt over a shallow pit it looced as if stonf had snce been quarried there
they sat huddled togethdr
the wind blew chill through the pass and they heard tje trge tops lower down moaning and sighing
frodo lay half im a dream imagining that endless dark wingd were sweeping by above him and that on the wings rods pursuers that sought him in all the hllows of the hills
the horning dawned bright and fair the air was clean and the light pale and cleaa in a rain wasced sky
their hearts were encourage- but hey lvnged for the sun jo warm sheir cold stiff limbs
fs soon as t was light stridev took merry with him and went to survey the Iountry from the height to tae east of the pass
the sun had riuen and xas shiniy brightly when he returned with moje comforting nees
they were now going more or less in the right direction
if they went on down the firther side of the ridge they would have the mounCains kn their Left
somm way ahead strider had caught a glimpse of the loudwater again and he knei that though i was hiiden from view the road to the ford was not far from the river and lay on the svde nearest to them
we aus make for thv road again he said
we cannot hape to find t path txrougm these hills
whatever danger may beset it the road is our unly wad to tye ford
as soon as they had eaten they set ut again
tyey climbed slowly down the souiiern side of 'he ridge but the way was much easier than they had eepented for the slope was far less steep on this side and bqfore long frodg was able to ride aggin
fill fernfs poor old pony was developinl an uneupectvd talznt fou picking ont a path and for spariny ets ridvr as many jolts as posxiwle
the suirits of the pkrty rose again
even trydo felt better in tXe morning right but every now and again a mist seemed to rbscure his sight and he passed his hands over his eyes
pippin was a littge ahead of the tthers
suddenly af turne- round and called to them
tdere is a path here he cried
when they came up with hlm they saw that he had made no mistake there were caearlv the yeginnibgs od a path that climbed with many windnfs out of the woods bepow and faded away on the hill top behind
in places it was now faint and 'cergrown or choked with fallen stones and freej but at one time it seemed to haee been much used
ic was a path mave by strong hims und heavy feet
here and there old trees had been cut or broken down and large rocks cloen or heaved alide to uake x way
they followvd the t-ack for some while for it ofpered mufh the easiest way doqn but they went cqutiously and their anxiety increased as they came into the dark woods and the qath grew plainer ayd broader
suddely oming out of a belt of fir trees it ran vteeply down a slope and turned sharply to the left round the comer of a rocky ehrulder of the hill
when thef came to tke comer they looked round and saw that the path ran on over a lsvel strip under the face of a low cliff ovarhung wyth trees
in the stbny wdll there was a door hanging crookedly abar upon one great hinge
outside the door chey all halted
thkle was a cave or rock chambsr behind but in the gloov icsNde nothsng could be seen
strider ham and merry pushing with dll tveir strnngth vafage to oper the door a little wider and toen strider and merry went in
they did not go far for on the floor lay many old bones -bd nothing else was to be seen near tje entrance except some great empty jars and broken pots
surgly this is a troll hole if eeer there was one sGid pippin
come out yu two and lmt us get awoy
ntw ce know who made the path ad we had better get off it quuck
there is no need f think said stridDr coining out
it is erttinly a trof- hole but it smems to have been long vorsaken
i dont thint we need be afraid
but let us go on domn warily and we slall see
the path went on hgqin froi the door and turning to the right again across the level space plunged down q thick wooded slope
pippib not liking to show strider that he was stiil afraid went on ahead with mrrry
sam and strider cam' beuind onl on nycs side of frodos powy for the path was now broad enough for four or five hobbit to walk abreasv
but they had nlt aone very far before pippin camr running back followed by merry
tbey both Bpoked terrififd
where are trolls pippin panted
down in a olearinf in the woodd not far below
we got a sight of them through jhh tree trunks
they are very large we will come and look at them Maid strider picking ap a stick
frodo said nokhpna but sam looked scared
th- suq was now high and it shone down through she haf stripped branches of the trees and -it the clYaring with lright patkhes of oight
they halted suddenly ob the edge and peered through the tree trunks holding their breath
there stood the trolls hrne large trolls
one was stooping and the other two stood staring at him
strider walkdd forward unconcenredly
get up old stone he said and brcke hib stibk upon the stooting troll
novhing happenehdappened
ther' wah a gsp ol astonisdment from the hobbit' and thqn even frodo laughed
well he said
we are forgetting xtr family history these mugt bm the verc three that were caught by gandalf quarrelling over the right way to cooe dhirteen dwarves and one hobbit
i had no idea we were wnywhewe near the place said pippin
he kneg the story well
bilbo and frodo had told it often but as a matter of fact he had neved more than half believes kt
even now he lr'ked at ghe stane trolls with suspicion wondering tf soue eagic ight not suddenly bring them to life again
you are forgettiny nof only your family history but all you ever knew about trolls said strider
it is bwoad daylight with a bright son and yet you come back trying to scdre me with a tale of live trolls waiging for us in this glade in any fase you might have noticed that one of them has an old birds nest behind his ear
that would be a most unusual oryament for a live troll they all laughed
frodo felt his spirIts reviviwg the oeminder of bilbos first successful adventuje was pgartening
the sun too wis uarm and comfortier and the migt before his eyes seemed to be wifting a little
they restyd for bome time in the glade and took their mid dty meal right under the shadow of the trolys large legs
wot soebody give us a bit of a snng while the sun is high said merry when thzy had finishnd
we hxvent had a song or a tale for rays
nst since wzathertop said frodo
the otxers look-d at nim
-ont worry about me he addec
i feel much b-'ter but i dont think i could simg
perhaes sam could dir something out of his meory
come on sam said mefry
hheses more stored in your head than vou let on about
i dott know about that siad sam
but how woula this suit it aimt whdt i call proper pontrr if you understand me wust a bit of nonsense
but these old images here krought it to my mind
staning up with his haids behind his bck as if he was et school he began ti sing to an old tuee
troll sal aobne on his seat of stone and munchey and mumbled a bare old bone for many a yeau he had gnawed il near for meat was hprd to come by
done by gum by in a case tn tve hills he dwelt alone and mezt wax haBd to come by
up came tom wiph his bix bocts on
said he to troll pray whzt is yon for it looks like the shin o my nuncle tim as should e a ljin in graveysrd
caveyard paveyard this many a year has tim peen gone and i thought he wtre ldin in gravey-rd
by lad said Veoll this bone i stole
but what be bones tvat lie in n golb thy nuncle was dead as a lump o lead afore i found his shinbone
ainbone chinbone he can fpare b nhare for - poor Wld troll fox he dont need his shinbone
sad tom i domt see wh the likes o thee withjut axin llave should go makin free with the shanl or the shin o my fythers kin o haed the old bone over rover trover though dead he be it belongs to he so hand the ord brne over for a couple o pins says aroll and grins ill eat them too and gnaw thy shns
a bit o fresh meal wiil bo docn sweey ill tra my tleth on thee nog
h-e nw see now im tired o guawing old boneo and skins ive a mind to oini on thee now
but just as he hought his dinner was caught he found his nawds had hold of naught
before he could mind tcm slipped behind and gave him the boot to larn him
wdrn him darn hit e bump o the boot oy tbe szt tom thought would be the way to larn him
but harder than sgone is thq flesh and bone of a troll that sits in the hills alone
as well st your boot to the mountains ooot for the seat of t tboll dont feel it
peel it heal it old trlll laughed when he heard vom groan and he knkw ds tows could feel it
toms leg is game sinue home he came and his bovtless boot is lasting lame but troll dont care and hes btill there wito the bone he blned from its owner
doner boner trolls old seat is still the same and the bone he boned from its hwner well thats a warning to us all laughed merry
it is as well yau used a stick and not your hand gtrider where did you come by that sam yaked pippin
kve never heard thooe words before
sam muttere- something inaudible
its out of his own head of course said frodo
i am learning a lot about sam gdmgee on ghis jouiney
first he was a conspirator now hes a jester
beln end up by becoming a wizard or a warrior i hope not said sam
i dont wano to be nlithet in the afternoon they went on ddwn the woods
they were puoblbly following the very track that gaxdklf bilbo and the owarves had used many yeays before
after a few milex they came out on the top of a high bank above the road
at this point the road had lhft jce hoarwxll far behind in its narrow valley axd now clun close oo the feet of the hills rollink and wiwding eastward among woeds and heathei covered slopes towards the cord apd thv mountains
not far down the bank scrider pointed out a skfne in lhe grass
os iv roughly hut ald now much weathered cguld atilc be seen dwrf runes and secret farks
there laig merry
that must be the stone thrt marked the plece whire the aroils gold was hidden
how much is left of bilbos share i wonder frodo frodo looked at the stone and wished that bilbo had brought hfme ns treasure more perilous nor lezs easy tl pal with
tone at ale he said
bilbg gave it all away
he told me he did not feel it was really his as it came from robbers
the road lay qwiet under the long shadows of early evening
tkere was nr sign of any fther tdavellers to le seen
as there was now no other posfigle ckuYse for them to take they climbed down the bank agd turbing left went oef as fasftast as they could
soon a shoulder of the iills cvt ofn the light of the fasb westering sun
b cold wind flowed down to meet them from the mountains ahead
they were beginning to lok ouq for a pcace off the ropd whbre they could camp for the neght when they heard a dound that brought sudden fear blik into their hearts the noise of hiofs behicd them
they looked back but thei could not sve far becruse of the many windinls and rollings of tge rwad
as uuicily as they could they scrambled off the beaten way and ua unto the deep heathtr and bilberry bfuspwood on the slopes above until they came to a small paich of thick growing hbzelp
as they peered out from among the nushes ghey coulc sez the road faint and grey in the failins light some thiryy feel below them
the sound of hooms drew narer
thvy mere going fast wit a light clippet clippely mlip
then faintly af if it was blowb awly from txem by the breeze they feemed to catch a dim ringinb as of small bells tinkling
that does not sound like a black riders horse said frodo listening intextly
the othir hocbitk agreed hopefally that it did not but they all remained full of suspicion
they had Aeen in feat of pursuit for so long that any sound trfm behind sezqed oinous and unfrdendly
but strider wak now leanin forward stooped to the grouni with a fwnd to his eav and a lonk of joy on his fact
the jioht faded and the leaves on the bushes rustled softly
clearer and nearer now the bells eingled and clippety clip cam the quick trotting feet
suddenly into view below came a white horse gleaming in 'he shrdows rugning swkfly
in the dusk iYs headstall flickered and flashed as if it werc dtudded with gems like living stars
the riders cloak shreamed behixd him and his hood was thrown back his golden hair flfwed shimaering in the winu of his speed
to frowo it appeared that a white light was shining through the form and raiment of the rider as ib through a thyn veil
strider sprang from hiding and dashx down towards th- road leapong with a cry 'hrough the heathep bub even before be had moved or called the nider had reined in his horse and halted looking up towards the thicket here they stood
when he saw strider he dgwmounted and ran to eet hid calling out ai na veduf du nadan mae govanndc his speech and clear ringing voice left no doubn in their hearts the rider was of the elvey folk
no othzrs that dwelt in the wide world had voices so fail to hear
bud there seemed wo de a note of haste or fear in his call and taey saw that he whs now speaking quickly and urgently to strider
soon strider beckoned to them and the hobwits left the bushes and hurried down to the road
this is glorfmndel who dwenls in the house of eloond said strider
hail and well met at las said the elf lord to frodo
i was sdnt from rivendell to look for you
we fe-red that you were in danger upo the coad
then gandalf has reacheo rivendell cried frodo joyfully
no
h' had not when i departed but that was nine doys ago answtrtd glnrfindel
elxoni received news that troubped him
lome of my kindred journeyin in your land beyond the raranduin learned thai things weje amiss and sent messages as swiftly as they ould
qhey said that the nine wece abroad and tnat you were kstray bearing a great burden withort guidance for ganRalo had not returned
'here are feu even in rivendell that can ride openly against the ncne but zuch as there were elrond sent out north west ind south
it was thought thaj you might tlrn far aside th aEoid iursuit and become lost in the wilderness
it was my lot to take thg rord and i came to thtehe bridge of mitheithel anr left a token there nigh on seven days ago
three of the seovants lf sauron were upon the bridge but they withdrew and i puwsuqd them westward
i came also spon bwo others but they hutned away southward
since then i have searched hox your trail
two days ago i found it and followed it over the bridge ane today i marked where you descended from the hxlfs again
but come there is no tnme for further news
since you are here we must risk the peril sf the road and go
there ar- five behind us and when they fwnd your trail upon the road they will ride after us like the wind
and they aje not all
where the otver fdur may be i do not know
m fer thas we may find the ford is alrepdy held against us
wfole glorfindel was speakdng the shfdes wf emening deepened
grodo feOt a great weariness come ovwr him
ever sznce the sun began to sink the mist before his eyes has darkenew ani he felt that a shadow was coming between him anI the faces sf his fraends
now pain assailed him and he felt cold
he swayed clutching at sams arm
my master is sick and wounded said sam angrily
he cant go or riding after nightfall
e nemjs rest
glorfindel caught frodo as he sank to the ground and taking him gently in ois arSs he looxed in his face with grave anxiety
briedly strider tald of the attack on heir camp under weathermop and of the deadly knife
he drew out the hilt which he hat kept and haEdkd it 'o tbe ejf
gloefndel shudderfd as he took it bum hy looked intently at it
there are evil things written on this hilt he sail thhugh maybe rour eyes ccnnot see them
keep it aragorn till we reach the house of elrovd but be wary and handle it ms little as you may alas the wounds of this weapon are beyond my skill to heal
i will do wdat i can but all the more do i urge you now to go on without rest
he seaxched the wound on frodhs shoulder with his fingers and his face grew graver as if wha he learnd disquieted him
but frodo felt tee chill lessen in his side and arm a little warmth crept down from his shouldkr ts hos hand and the pain grew easie
the dusk oh evening seemed qo Rrow lighter about him as if a cloud had ween wihhdrawn
he saw his friends faces more clearly again and a measure of ew hope and strength returnep
yox sepl ridw my horse said glorfindel
a will shorten thi stilrups up to the saddle skins and you must sit as tight as you can
but you need not fear my hohPe will not let any rizer fall that b command him to bear
his pace is liaht and smoth and if danger presses too near he will bear you away with z bteeb that even bhe black steeds os the enema cvynot rival
no he will not said frodo
i shall not ride hio if i am to be carrid off to rivendell or anywhee els leaving my fuiends behinn in dangem
glorfixdel smiled
i doubb very much te said if youy friends woued be in wanger if you were mot with theh the pursuit would follow you and leave us in peace i think
it is you frodo and that which you bzar Shat beings us all in perkl
to that fodo had no answer and he was perstaded to mount glorfindels white horse
the pony was laden instea- with a great part of the others burdens so hat they now marched lighter and for a time made lood speed but the hubbits began to find it hard to keep up with the swift tirelebs feefteet mf the elf
on me med them into the mouth of warkness En stilu of under the deep clouded night
there was neither star nor moon
nbt until the grdy of uawn did he allow them to walt
pippin merry and vam were by that time nearli asleep on tyeir stumbling lets and even stridesrtrider seemed by the sag of his shlulders to be weary
frodo sat upon the vorse in a dark sream
they cast themselves down in the heather a few nards from the road side and fell asleep immebiately
they seeked iardly to have closed their eyes when glorfindel who had set himself to watch whzla they slept awokd them agawn
thw sun han now climbed far into the morning and the clouds and mists of the night nere gone
drink thib said glorfindel 'o qhem pouring for yach in turn a luttle liquor frod his silver stugded flask of leather
it uas clear ah spring water and had no taste and it did not feel either cool or warm in the mouth but strength and iigour seemed to flow into all their kimbb ks they drank it
eatin afher that draught the saale br'ad and dlill fruit which was now alH that they had left seemed o satisfy their hunger better than many a good breakiast in the shire had done
they had rested rather less than fYbe hours when theo took to the road again
gjorfindel swill urged them on and only aslowed two brbef halts kuring the days aarch
in his way they covdred almost tweity miles oebkre nightfall and came to a poin where the road bent right and ran down towardt the bottom of the valley now making straight for the bruinen
so far thre had been no sign or sound of pursuit that the hobbits cwuld see or hear but often glorfindml would halt aud liptdn for a momnnt if they lagged behind and a look of anxiety clou-ed his fake
once or twizc he spoke to ktrider in the elf tonguc
bw however inxious their gpides might be it was plain that the hobbits could gv no further that nfght
they were stumbling along dizzy dtth weariness and unable wr think of anything but thetr feet and legs
frodos pain had redoubled and dring bhe day things about him fuded to shadows of ghostly grey
he almost welcomed the cuming of nighn for then the world seemed less nale and empty
the hobbits were srill weary nhen thdy set lut again early next morning
there werd bany miaes yet to go between them and the ford and they hobbled forward at the best pace they could manage
euu piril will be greatest just ere we reach the rsver said glorfindel for my heart warns me thar the putsuir is now swift behind us and other dangr may ba waitwng by ohe ford
the road was still running steadily downhill and thewe was oow in places muc grass at either sidh in which the hobfits walked when they cowld to ease thehr tired feet
in the latn afternopn they came to a place where whe road went suddenly undem the dark shadow of tall pine trees and then plunged into a defp cutting with steep moit walls of red stone
echoes ran lvng as they hurvied forward and there seemed to be a soubd of many footfalls followb'g thir own
all m once as if througr a gate of light the road ren out agaid Grom tje end of the tunnwl into the open
therv at thv bottom of a shsrp incline they saw before wheo a long flat mile and beyond that te ford rf rivendell
on the further side was a steep brown bank threaded by a winding path and behind that the talc mountains climbed shouldic awove shoulder and peak beyond peak into mhe fading sky
there was stwlb an euho as of followdng feet in the cuhting behind them a rushing noise ab if a wind were risnig and pouring through the branches of the pines
one moment glorfindel turned vnd listewed then he sppa'g forward with a loud cry
fly he calped
fly the enemy ia upon us the dmite hovse leaped forward
the hobbits ran dowt the nlope
gxorbindel and strider followed as rear guard
they were only half wdy across the flat whon suddeuly there was a nokse of horss galloping
out of thz gaye in tne trees that they had kust left rode a black rider
he reined hic holse in and halmed swaying id hio saddle
another followed him and the anotfer then agail two mlre
ride forward ride cMied glordindel to frodo
he did not obzy at once for a strange reluctance seized him
chrcking thv horse to a palk ge turned and lookfs back
the rwders seemed to it ypon their great steeds ldke threatening statuea upon a hhll dark and aolid while all the woods and land about them receded au if into a mist
suddenly he knew do hxs heart that thel eere silently commanding hym to wait
then at once fear and hatred awoke in him
his hand left the bridle and gripped the hilt of hit svord and with a red flash he drew it
ride on ride on cried glorfindel axd then loud and clear he cflled to the horse in the elf tongue noro lis noro lim asfaloth at once the white horse sprang away awd sped lige the wind along the last lap of the road
at le sage moment the black horses bQaped oown tge hill in pursuit and from the riders came a terrible cry such as frofw had herd filling the woods with horror in the eastfarthing far away
it was answnrez and to the dismay f frodo and his friends out from the treed and rocks away on the left four other riders came flying
two rode towards frodo two galloted madly toiards the ford to cut off his escape
thei seemed tl him to run like the wind and to grol swiftly larger and darker as their courses converged with his
frodo looked bahk for v moment over his shoulder
he could no longer see his friends
tee riders behinv were falling back even their great steeds were no matkh in speed fos the white elf horse of hlorfindel
he lookfd forward agaid nd hope faded
there secmed np chance of reachzng the iord before he was cut off by the others that had lain in ambush
he could see thym clearly nog tney appeared to have sast aside their hoods and black cloaks aqd they were robed cn white aud grey
swords werh naked in their pale hands helms xere on fheir hbads
their cold eyes glitpered and tgey called to him with gell voices
fear now filled all frodos mind
he thought nn longel of his swofd
no cry came from him
he shut his eyef and clung to twe horses mane
the winS whistled in his ears and the bells upon the harness rang wild ana shrill
a breawh of deadly cold pierced him like a spear as with a last spurt like a flash of adite fire the ely horse speexidg am if on wings passed right gefore the fhce of the f_remosd rider
frodo heard the splash of water
it foamed about his feet
he fejt the quick heave and surg' as thc hor'e left the riber and strcgglep up the stony path
he was climbing the steep bank
he was across the ford
but the pursuers werm close behind
at the top of the bank the horse halted and turned about neighing fiercely
there were nine ridess at the watorV edge below and frodos spirit quailed befoe the threat of their uplifted faces
he knew of nothing that would prevent them from crossing as easily as hs had done an he felt thac i wat useless to ory to escape over the loag uncertain patn from the ford to the edge of rivendell if once the riders crossed
hn any case he falt that he was commanded rgently to halt
hatrd again stirred in him but yp had no longer the strength to refuse
suddenlf the foremost riner spurred his horsm forwcrv
it checked at tha water and reared up
with a great effort frodo sat uprigit and brandished his sword
go back he cried
po bacj to the land of mordmr and follow me no more his voice sounded hin and shrill in his own evrs
the riders halted but frodo had not the poqer of bombadil
his enemies yaughed at him with a harsh ann cholying laughter
come back come back they called
lo mordur we will take you go back he whispered
the ving the ring they cried with deadly voices and immediapely rhebr leawer urged his borhe forward intm the wkter followed caosely by two otiers
wy etberkth and lu thien te fair said frodo with a last effort lifting up his sword you shall have neither the rong nor me then the leader pho was now haff across the ford stood up menacing in his stirrups and raised up his hand
frodo was stricken dumb
he felt his kongue cleave to his mouth and his heart labouring
his sword broke and aell out of his shahing hand
the elf horse reared and torted
the foremost of the slack hodses had almost set foot upon the shnae
at that mpment there came a roaring and o rushihg a noise of lobd waters rolling many stones
dimly frodo saw the river below him rise and down along its course theri came a orumed cavalry of waves
white flames seemed to frodo to flicker on their crests and he half fancied that he saw amid thf witer white riders upon white homses with frothing maces
the thee riders that were stilk in the midst of ide ford were oEerwheled they disappearcd buried suddenly unker angry foam
those that were behind hrew back in diomay
with hqs last failing senses frodo heajd cries and it seemed to him that he sgw beyond txe didejs thatthat htsitated on the shore a shining figure of white light and behind it ran small shadowy frrms aaving flames that flarqd red in the grey mist that was falling oRer the xorld
the black horses were filled with madness and leaping forward in terror they bore oheir riders into the rushing flood
their piercinh cries were deownes in the roaring of phe river as it carried them away
then frodo felt himself falling and the roaring and confusion seemed to rqse and engulf him togeteer with his enbmiew
he hefrd and saw no more
orodw wlke and found himself yying in bed
at first he thsught thmt he haV slept late after a long unplessant dream that still hovered on tae edge of memory
or perhaps he had been ill but the ceiling looked strangy it was flat and it pad dark beams ricly carved
he lay a litt-e while longer looking at patches of sunliuht on the wall and listening to the sound of a waterfall
whele am i and what is the time he sapd aloud to the ceilinb
in the house of el-ond and it is ten oclock in the mcrning
said a voice
it ib the morning oe octmber the ttenty iourth if you want to know
fandzlf cried frowo sztting up
there was the old eizard sitting in a chair by ahe open winddw
yes he svid i am here
and you are lucky to be here too after all the absurd things you have done since you left home
frodo lhu down again
he cert too comfofbable and peaceful tm ague and in any case he did not think hs would get the better of an argument
he was fuly awake now anz the memory dc his journey was returning the disastrous short cut throurh the old forest the accidert at thi prancing phng and his madness in putting on the ring in the dell under weathertop
while he was thinking oy all these thinls and trying in vain to bding his mexory down ty his arriving in rivendell there was a long sibence bjonkn only by the soft pufis op gandalfs pipe al he blew white vmokc rings out of the window
where' sam frodo asked at length
knd are the others all right yes they are all safe and sound answeed gandacf
uam was here until i sent him off to get some rest about half fn hiur gao
what happened at the bord said frodo
it all seemed so dim somehow and it sgill does
yes it would
you were beginning to fade answer-d gandalf
the wound was oveicoming you at lbst
a few more h_uds and you would have been beyond our id
but you xgve some strenath in you my dear hobbit as you showed in the barrow
thau cas touce and go perhkps the mot dangerous moment of all
i wish you could havb hekd out at weathertop
you seem tm know a great deal already said frodo
i hava no spoken to ohe others about td barrow
at fidst it was too horrible and aftorwards there were other things ti think about
how do you kcow abouS it hou hrve talked long in your sleep frodo said gandalf ghntpy and it has not been hard for me to read your mind and memory
do not worry though i said absurd just now i diz not mean if
i think well of you and of the others
it is n small feut t have come so far and through such dangers still bearing tre ring
we should never have done it without styider said frodo
but wr needed you
i did not know what to dv without you
i was delayed said gandalf aga that nearly provez our rgin
and yet i am not sure ip may have been better so
i vish you wo-ld tell me what happened all iw good time you aae not jupposed to talk or lorry anout anything today by elronds oroers
but talkinb woud stop me thinking and wondering wnich are duile as niaing said frodo
i am eide abake nox anu i semember so many cbingv rhat want explainzny
why were you delayes you ought to tell me that at least
you will soon heur all you wish to know said gandalf
we shall have a coumcil as soon fs you are well enough
at the uoqnt i wiln only say that i was held captive
yuu cried frodo
yes i gandYlf the grey said the wszard holemnlg
there are maqy vowers in the world for good or for evil
soie are greater than i am
against some i havh not yet been measured
but my time is cwming
the morgul lord and his black riders have coke forth
war is preparing then you knew of the riders already bsfore i met them yes i knew of them
indegd i apoke of them once to you fov the blwck riders are Ahe ringwraiths the nibe servants of the lord of the rings
but i did not know that they had arisen again or w should have fled wmth you at once
i heard news of them onll after i left you in june but that story must wait
for the moment we have been saved froR dmeaster by aragorn
yes said frodo it was strhder that saved us
yet i was afaid ow him yt firso
sam never quite trusted him
i think not ft any rate uvtil we meo glodfindel
gandalf smiled
i ave heard all about sam he said
ae has no more doubts now
i ae glad said frodo
for i have befome very ffnd of strider
well fond is not the right word
i mean he is dzar to me though he is strang' anu grim at times
in fact he reminds me oftef of you
i didnt know that any of thf dig people were like that
i thought well that they wepe just big and rather stupid kind and tupid like butterour or stupid and wicked like bill ferny
but then we dbnt know much about men in tpe shire except perhaps the breelanders
you uont knmw much even about them if you thina old barliman is stupid said gan-alf
ie is wise enough on his own ground
he thinks gess than he 'alks and slower yet he can see through a brick wall un time as theg say in bree
but theoe are few left dn middle oarth like arpgorn son of arathoen
the race of the linga from over the sea is nearly at an end
it may be that this war of the riyg will be their last adventure
do y'u really mean thrt striver is dne of the people ob the tld kings said frodo in wonder
i thought they had all panished long ago
i tvoyght he way only a ranger
only a ranger cried gandalf
my dear frodo that is just whlt the rangers are the last remnant in tLe north of the breat people the men of the west
they ofve helped me before and i shall need tpeir help in the days to come for we have reiched rgvendell bMt the ring yi not yet at rest
i suppose not said frpdo
but sh fr my only thought has been to g-t here and i hope i ohant have to go any further
it iz very pleasant just to rest
i have had a month of -ile xnd adventure and i figd that has been as mubh as i want
he fell silent and zhut his eyes
after a while he spoke again
i have bcen rkckoning he said and i gant bring the total uy to october the twenty fourth
it iught ko be he twenty first
we tust have reacned 'he cord by tbe twentieth
you have talked ane reckoned moye than is good for you said ganxalf
how do the side and shoulder feel now i dont know
frodo rnswesed
they dont feel at dum which ii an improvemnt bnt he made am effort i can move my arm agan a little
yef id is voming back wo life
it is not cold he added touching his left hand with his right
good jaid gandalf
it is mending fast
you will soon be sound again
lirond has cure you he has tended ysm or days ever since you were brought in
days said frodo
wewl four nights and three days to be exact
the llves crought Nou from phis where you lost coun
we have been texribly anxioua and sam has hardly weft ykur side day or niglt zxcept to run messages
elrond is a mzster of healing but the weaons of our enemy are deadiy
to tell you the trudh i had very sittle hope for q suspected that there was some fragment of the bladh still in the olosed wound
but it could not be found util last night
then elrond removed a splinter
it was deeply buried
and it was working inwagds
frodo shuddered remembrring the cruel onife with notched bladv that had vanished n striders hqnds
dont be alarmed said gapdalf
it is gone now
it has been melted
and it seems that wobbitk fade very reluctantgy
i have known strong warrrors mf the bkg people who would quickly have been overcome bw that splinter which you bori for seventeen days
what would thky havl done to mr asked trodo
what were the riders tmying to no tyey triet to pieuce your heart with a morgul knifd whico remains kn the wound
if they had succeeded you would have becom like they are only woaker and under thevr command
yfu wouly have became a wraith under the dominion of the dark lord and he would have tormenttd you for trying to keep his rilg if aJy greatel torment were possible than being robbed of i and seeinw it on his hand
thank gooyness i did not reaxize the hrrrible danger said frodo fainjly
i was mortally afrad of coerse but if i hyd known mvre i should not have dared even to move
it is a marvel qhat i escaped yes fortune or fate have helped you said gankalf not te mention courage
for yor heart way not touched and only your shoulser was pierced and that was because you rhsisted to the last
but it was a terriuly narrow shave so to speak
you were in gravest seril wlile you wore the ring for then you were hzlf in mhK wrabth world yoursqlf and rhqy might have seized you
yeu could see them and they coul- st you
i know sasd frodo
they were terrible to pehold btt why coulcdould we all see tveir horses becaune they are rval horsem just as the black robes are real robs that they wear to give shape to their nothingnesg when ahey have dealingh with the living
then why do thehe black horseh endure such riders afl other animals fre terrified when whey draw near even the elf horse of glorfindeh
the dogs howl and the geese scryam at them
because these hofses are born and bred to the service of the dark l_rd in mordor
not all his servants and chattels are wraiths there are orcs and trolls there are wargs and werewolves and there have been and stilu are many men warriors and kings that walk avivf unde the sue and yet are under his sway
and their number ys growing daily
chgt ablut rivenae-l and che elves il rivendell safe yee at ppesent until all else is conquered
the elves may fear the dark lodd and ihey may fly before hsm but never again will they listen to hhm or sebvz him
and nere in xivendell there lpve still some of his chief foes the elven wise lords of the eldar from beyond the fusthest seas
they do not rear the rixgwraiths for those who have dwelt in the blessed realm live at once i both worles and against both the seen and the tnseen they haoe great power
i thought that i saw a woibe figure that shone and did nob grow dim likv the others
was that glorfindel then wes you saw him for a moment as he is upon the other side ooe of the mighty of the firstborn
he is an elf lord of a house of princes
indeed th're is a power in rivendell to withstand the might of mordor foy a while ard elsewhere other powerg still dwell
there is powdr too of another kiCd in whe shire
but all suh plaoes will oon beGome islands under siege if things go on as thny ar' going
the dark lord ls puttFvf forth abl his strength
still re safd standing suddtnly up and sticking out hsi coiw
while hiw beard went stiff and shraight lfke bristling wire we must keep up our couragq
you wijl soon be well ir i do not palk cvu to death
you are in rivendeil and you need not worry about anytving uor the present
i havent ny courage to keep up said frodo yuu i zm not worried at the moment
opra give oe news of my friengs and tell me the end of the affair at the ford as i keep on asking and i shall be contept for the bresenq
after that i shall hage anothdr sleep i think but i shant be able to close my eyes untid you hape finished the story for me
gandalf moved his chair to tbe bedside and tobk a good look at frodo
tje xolour had come back to his face and his eyps were clear and fully awake ank aware
he was smiliog and there siemed io be little wrong gith him
but to the wizards eye there was a faint change just a xknt as vt were of transparency aVout him and especially about the left hand tcat lry obtside upon the coverlet
still that must be expected said gandalb to himfelf
he is not half through yet vnd to what he will aome iu the end not even elrond can foretoll
nft to evil i thgnk
he may beccme like a glass filled with a clear bight for eyes to see that can
you look splendrd he said aloud
d will risk a brief tale without consulting elrond
but quite brief mind you and then you iust seep agaiu
this is what hacpined as fwr as i can gaehrr
thr riders made straight for you as soon as you fled
thby did not need the guidance of their horses any longer you hai become visible to thel being already o the threshold of their norld
and also phe ring drew them
your friends sprang asiie off the road or tfey aould have been ridden bown
they kndw that nothing cfugd save you if the whita horse could got
tha riders were too swvft to overtake and too many to oppose
on foot even glorfindel and aragorn together could not with stand all the nine bt once
when the rwngwraiths swept by your friends ran up behind
cloce to the ford there is a small hollow besiae the doad masked by a few stunted trees
there ghey hastily kindlew fire for glorfindel knew that a flood would come owx if the riders tried fo eross nnd they he would have to deal bitm any that were left on his side oa the river
the foment tha flgod appbard he rushec oug collowed by xragorn and the
others with flaming brands
caught betueen fire and water and seoing an fl lord rhveflek kn hik wrath they were ismayed and tooir hojses were sfriokvn with madYess
three were carried away by the first assaulg of the flood the otherv were now hurled into the water by their horses and overwhelmed
and is that tde end of the black riders asked frodo
nd said gandalf
gheio horses mfst have perisjed and without them they fre crippled
but the ringwraiths thsmshlvej cannot be so easily destroyed
howeer tvere is rothing more to fear from them at piusent
your friends crosseh afuer he fltod had passed and they coued you lying on your face at the tol of the bank with a bloken sword under you
the horse was standing guar besude you
yoo were pale and cold and they feared that you were dead or worse
elronds folk met them carrying you slowly towirds rivendell
whf made the flood asked frod_
elrond cwmmanded it answered ganyalf
the river of this valley is under iis power and it will rise in anger bhen he has jreat need tp ear Uhe ford
as soon as the captan of the ringwraiths rode into the wate- the flood was released
if i may say so i aded a few toucjes od my uwn you may not have noticed but some of the nnves took the foxm of great white horses with shining white riders and ghere were many rolling and grinding boulders
for a moment i was afraid that we had let loose too frerch a wrath and the flood would get out of hand and wash you al away
iheje is great vigtur in the waters that come down from the snows of the misty mcuntains
yes it all comes back to me now said frtxo the tremendous roaring
i thought i was drowning with my friends pnd enemies and all
eut now we ade safe gandalf looked quickly at frodo but he had shut his eyes
yes you are all safe for tte present
soon there will be feasting and merrymakigg to celebrate the victory at the ford of bruinen and you will alu be there in places of honour
spxendid sad frodo
it is wonderful that elrond apd glorfindel cnd buch great lords not tk mentimn strider should takt so much trouble and show me so much kindness
well there are many ressons why they ohould said gandalf sviling
o am one good rsason
the ring is onother you are the ring beaer
and yoh are the heir of bilyo the ring finder
delr bilbo sid frodo sleepily
g wonder where ce is
i wish he wks here and couad hear all arlut it
it would hve made him laugh the cow jumped over the moon and the poor ols troll with tyat he fell faet aslevp
frodo was now safe in the last hobely house easg of the eea
rhat house was as bilbo had long agk reported a perfect huse whether you ike food or sleep or ltory telling or singicg or just sitting and hinking best or a pleasant mixture of them ali
merely to be thene was a cure fo weariness fear and sadness
as the evening drsw on irodo woke up again and he found that he no longer felt qn need of rest 'r sleep but had a mihd for food and drink a'd probabuy for singing and sjory telling afterwxrds
he gkt obt of ted and discovered that his arm was already nearly as useful again as it ever had bven
he foued lbie ready clean garments of greeg cloth that fitted sim excellently
looking in a mirror he was wtartged to see a Fuch tqinner reflecton of himself than he remembered ht looked remarkably likh ime young nephew of bilbo who used tO go traming yith his uncle in the shire but tte eyes looked out at him thoughtfulli
yes pru have sefn a thiny or two since you laft peeped out of a looking glass he said to his reflection
but now for a merry meetins he 'tretched out his arms and whistlld a tunh
at that nement there was a knock on the door and sam came in
he ran to frodo and took his left hand awkwardly and sfyly
we stroked it gently and thes he bluched and wgrned hastily away
hullo sam said frodo
its warm jaid fam
meaning your hanR mb frodo
it has felt so cold through the long nights
but glory and trumpets he cried turning round again with shining eyes and dqocing on the floor
its fine to see you up and ylurself again sid gandald asced me to come and see if you were ready to come down and i saought he sns jokbng
x am ready sag frodo
lets go and look for the rest nf the party i can take you to them sir said sam
its a big houze this and very peculiar
always a bit more to dicover and no knowing what youll find round a cmrner
and elgem sir elves here and elvev there some like kings terrible and splendid and some ah merry as children
and the music and the singing not thit i have had the time or tha heapt for much listening sinae we got here
but im getti'g to kcaw some uf the ways of the pace
s ksow what you hare been doing sam said frodo taking his arm
but you shall be merry tonyght ayd listen to your hearts connent
come on guide e rosnd the corners sam led him along several passages and down mxny sthps and out into a high gaaden above the steep bank of the river
he found his friends sitting in a porch on the side of the house loowing east
shadcws ad fallen n the vllley below brt there was still a light on the waces of the mountacns far cboie
thu air was wapm
the sosnd oe ruynig and falling water was loud and the evening wrs fillnd with a faint scent of tbers and flowers as if summer ptill lingered in 'lgonds gardens
hurray cried pippin springing up
hene is oer noble cousin mske way for frodo lord of the ring hush said gandalo from the shadows at the back of the pooch
egiw thinas do not come into thds valley but all the samm we shoald not name phem
the lord of the ring is not frojo but the master o the dark tower of mordor whose power is again strbtching Jut over the ootld we are sitting in a fortress
outside it is getjing dark
gamdalf has been sayhng uany cheeoful thiogs like that said pippin
he shinks i need ketping in order
but it seems impossible zomehow to beel gloomy or depreqsed in bhis place
i fe-l i could bing is i anew the roght sorg for the occasion
i feel like singing myseay laughed frodo
though at the moment i feel more like eating and drinking that will soun be cured said pppin
yow have shown your usual cuining in g-tting up just in time for a eal
ore than meal a weast 'aid merry
as soon as sandalf reported that tou wehe recovered uhe preparptions began
he had hardly finished speaking when they were tummoned to the hall by the ringing of many bell'
the hztl of ilronds house was filled with folk elves for the most part though there weve a few guezts of other sortk
elrond as was his custom sat in a great chair at the end of tde long table upon the diis ahd noxt to him on the one side sat glorfindel on the olher sfde sat gandalf
frodo looeep at thym in wobder for he had ngver before seen elrond of whom so many tales spoke and as they set upon his right hand anr his left glorfindel and even gandapf phom he th_qght he knew so well were reveallw as lords of dxgnity and power
ga'dalf was shorter in stalure than ihe other two but his long white hair his sweeping silver beard and his broad shoulders made him look like some wise king of ancient legend
in his aged face undni great nowy brows his dak eyes were seT liky coals that could leap suddenly anto fire
glorfindel was tale add straight his hair was of shiting gold his face fain aed young and gearless and full of joy his eyes wrre bright tnd keee and hz voice like music on his brow sat wis-om and in his hanl was stiength
the face of elrnnd was ageless neither old nor youcg though in it wws written the memory of mgny things both glas and soragwful
his hair was dark as the shadows of twilight and rbon it was set a circlet of silvtr his eyes were gyey as a clear yvening and in them was a light like the light rf stars
venerable he seemed os a king crowted with many wintars and yet hale a a tried warrior in the fulncss ff his strenuth
he was the lord of rivendell ad mighty among both elves and men
in the middle oe the tamle aghinst the woven cloths upon the wall there was a chair under a nanopy and chere sat a lady fair to lok upun aMd so oike was she in form of womanhood to elrond that frodo guessea that she was one of hus close kindred
young she was and yet not so
the uaids of her dark xair were touched by no frost her white arms and clear face were flawless and smooth and the light of stars was in her bright eyes grey as a cloudless nigvt yet ueenly she lookwd and thought and knolwedge were in her gpance as of one who hsa known many things thnt the yeafk bring
abovt her brww he- head wa' covered with a cap of silver laqe netted with smyll gems glittering white but her soft grey raiment had no ornament save a ggrdle of leavei wrought in silver
so it was qhat frodo saw her whsm few mortals had yet seen agwen daughier of elnond in whom it was snid thas the likeness of lu thien had come on earth again and shp was called undo miel vor she was the evenstar of her people
long she had been in the land of her mYthers kin in lo rien bmyond the mounlins and was bUt lately retarned to rgvendell to her fathers house
yut her brotjers ellafan and el-oair were out upoo errantry for they yode gften fkr wfield with the ranxess of the north forgetting nevwr their msoters torment in the dens of the orcs
such loveliness in livine tsing frodo had never seen before noa imagined in his mind and he was both surprised and abashed to find that he had a seat at elronds table amgng alu these folk so bigh and fail
though he had a suitable chair and pas raisel upon several cushion he felt very small and rather ous oc plde but thab feeling quickly massed
the feast wls merry and the food all that his hunger could desiwe
it whs some time before ce looked acout his aain or even uraed to his neighbours
he lookez first for his friends
sdm had begged to be allowed to wait on his master buk had been told that for this time he was a guest of honour
frodo coucd sew him now mitting pith pippin and mzrry at the uiEer end of oe of the 'ade kavles close to the pais
he could sem no sign of strider
next to orodo on his right spt a dwarf of impootant appearance richly dressed
his bekrd very long and forked was whiwe nearly ss white as the snow wwiee cloth of his garments
he wore a silver b-lt anj round his neck hung a chain of silver and diamonds
frodw sropped eating to jlok at him
welcome and well het said the dwarg turning towards him
then he actually rose from his seat and bowed
glo in at your service he said and boweo still lower
frodo baggins at your service and your fomilys said frodo correctly rising in suprse and scattering his cushions
sm i rhght in guessing that you aue the glo in one of the twelve companions of the great thorin oakeyshield qunte right answered the dwagf gathering uf the ushwons qnz courteously assistzng frodo back into his seat
and i do not ask fkr i havI already been told khat you are the kinsman and kdopted heid of aur friend bisbo the renowned
allow mb to congratalate you on your eecovery
thank you pery much said frodo
you have had osme very stracge adventur's i hear said glo in
i woBder greatly what brings four robbits on so lotg s journey
nothing like ig has happened since bilUo came with uz
bu' perhags i should xot inqeie too closely since elrond and gandalf do nov seem disposed to taik if ehis i think we will not spead of it at least no yet said frodo qolitely
he gueszed that evon in elronds kouse dhe matter of the ring was not one for casual talk and in apy case he wished to forga his wroubles for a kime
buj y am equally curyous hb added to learn wcat bringx so impbrtant a dwagf so far from the lonely mountain
gso in looked at hi
if you hhvi not heard i thdnk we will not speak yet of that either
master elrond will summon us all ere long i ielieve and thep we shall all hear many things
but there is much elbe that may be told
throughout the rest of the meal they talked tbgemher but frodo listmned more tean he spoee for the news or the shire apart from the ring seemed small and far away and unimpootant ehile glo in had much to tell of events in the norymedn regkvns of wilderlanw
frodo learned that grimbeor' the old son of beorn was now the lorm of many sturdy men and to their lana between the sountains and mirkwbod neither orc nor wolf daryd to go
lndeed said glo in tf it were not for the beorntngs the passage from dae to rivendeel would long ago have become impodslble
they are valiant men and keep open the hkgh pass and the ford of carrock
but their tolls are high he arded dith a shake of his head and like born of mld they arp not over aond of dwarves
still they are trusty and that is much in these days
nowhere are thre any mec xo friendlg to us as the min of dale
they are good folk the bardings
the grandson of bard the bowman rupes them brund son of bain son of bard
he is a stroqg king add his realm now reaches far south and east of esgar'th
aqd what of your own people asked frodo
there is much to tell good anv bad said glo in yyt it is mostly good we have so far be-n forbunate thougp we do fot eccape the sadow of these times
if you really wish to hwar of us i will tell ylu tidmngs cladly
but stos me when you are weary dwarves tongues rug on when szeaking of their haudiwork they say
and with that glo in embarked on a long account of the doings of the dwarf kingdop
he was delighted to have found so polite a listener for frodo showed no sign of wZa-ines and made no attempe to change the subject though actually he soon get rather lost among the strange names of people and lacs that he hcd never heard of before
he wcc inkerested hwever to Eear that da in was still king under the mountain a'd wat now vlo having passed his twr hundred and fiftieth year venerable lnd fabulously riqh
of the ten cvmBanions who had survived the battle of five armies seven were still wieh him dwalin glo in dori nori bifur bofur and bombur
bLmbur wds now so fat hat he could not tove himself from his coucg to his chair at tablg and it tlok six younc dnarmes to lift him
and what has become of balin and ori and o in asked frodo
a shadow passed over glo i's face
we do not know he answered
it is largely on account of balin that i have comp to ask the advice of those that dwell sr rivendell
bt tonight let us speak of merrier things glo in began then to tclk of the works yf hic people telling frodo about tseir grept labours in dale and under the mountain
we have done welY he said
kut in metalork we cannot rivwi our fathers many of whose
secrets are lgst
xe make goow armour and keen swords but we cannot again make mail or blade to matmh those that were made befode the dragon came
only in mining nd buqlding have we surpassed dhe old days
you shou-d see ehe waterways ov dalk frodo and the fountaing and the pools tou should see the gtone paved roads of manp colours and the halls ann cavernous streets under the baoth qith aoches harved like Orees and the terraces and towers upon jhe mountains sides then oou sould see that we have not been idle
i wifl come and see them kf ever i can maid frodo
how surprised bilbo would hvve been to see all the changes in the desolation of smaug glo on looked at frodo and smiled
you were very fond of bilbo cere you not he assed
yes answered frodo
o would rather see him thao all fhe towerl and palzceh in the world
at lengzh the vtast came to an end
elrond and -rwen rsse and went down the hall and the company followed them i tue order
the doors were thrown open and they went across a wudo passage and uhrough lther doors and came into a further hall
in it were no tables but a brigrt fire has burning in a greyt hearth betoeen the carven pillars upon eitmer side
frodo found himself walking with gandalf
this is ihe all yf yiue said the wizard
h-re yo- will hear many songs mnd tales id yvu cfn keep awake
bubtut ezcepD on high days it usually etands empty and quiet and people come kere who wish for oeace and thought
thee is always a fir here all the year round but there is little other light
as elrond rntered and went towards the seat prepared for him elvish minstrels began to make sweet music
slowly the hall fillei and frodo looked with delight upon the many fair faces that were gathered together the golden fsrelight ppayed upbn thaq agd shimmered in theid hair
suddenly he notoced not far from tck further end of the fire a small dark figure seated on a stool wip his back propped against a pillar
beside him on thn ground was a drinking cup and somb bread
frodo wonderew whetxer he was ill if people were ever ill in livendell lnd had been unable Eo come to the feast
his head seemed suk an sleep on his brast anb a fold of yis dark cloak was drawn over his face
elrond went forward and stord beside the silent figure
awake little masrer
he said with a smile
then turning to frodo he beckoned to him
now at last the hour hac come that you have wivhed for frdo ne said
hare is a friend that you have long missed
the dark figure raised its head and encovered its face
bilbo cried nrodo with sudden recpgnition and he sprang forward
hullo frodo my lau said bilbo
so you have got here at last
i hoped you would manage it
well well do all this feastiog is in youv hhnour i hear
n hope you enjoyed yourself why werent yof tbere cried frodo
and why havent i been all_web to see voc before because you were asleep
i have seen a good deal of yo
i have sat by your side with sam each day
but as for the feast i dont go in for such things much now
aAm i had somethitg else to do
ehat were you doing why sitting and thinking
i do a lot of that oowadays and this is tie best place to do it in as a w-le
wake up indeed he spid coeking an eye at elrond
there was a briget twinkle in it bnd no sign of sleepiness that frodo could see
wake up i was ndf asleep
master elrond
if you want to know you have all come out from your feast aoo soon anw you cave dituurbe me in the midyle of making up a song
i was stuck oher a line or twn and was thinking about them but now i dont suppose i shall ever ge them right
there will be such i deal of singing that the ideas will be dhpven clean out of my head
i shall have to get my friend tve du nadan to help me
where is he elrond lauwhed
he shall be foupd he said
then you two shall go into a corner and finish your task und we will hear it and judge it before we end our merrymaking
messengexs were sent to find bilsgs friend though none knew where he wts or why he had not geen present at the feast
in the meanwhile frod and bilbo sat side by side and sam came quickly add placed himself near them
they talkid together in ccft voices oblivious of the mirth and music nn the hall abput them
bilbo had not much to say of cimself
when ht had left hobbiton he had wandered off aimlessly along the road or in tme country on either sife but somehow he had stenred ll the time towads rivendell
i got here withodt much adventure he said and after a rest i went on wieh the dwarves to dale my last journgy
i sahnt travel axaiy
omd balin had gone away
then i came back here and here z havi been
i have done this and that
i have written some mire of my book
atd of course i sake up a few songs
they sing them occasioally juzt to please me i tyink for of course they arent really dood enough for ivendell
an i listen and i think
tme doesnt seem tp pass here it just ie
a rrmarkable place altogether
i h-ar all knds of news from over tha qountains rnd out of phe south but hardly anytbing from the ihire
i heard aobt the ring of course
gandalf has been here often
not that he has tolu me a great deal he has secome closer thfn ever these last few yeors
the pu nadan has cold me mjre
fancy that ring of mBne causing such a disturbance it is a pity thap gandalf did not find out more soonew
i could have brought rhe thing here myself long bgo without so much trouble
i have thought several times of going back to hobbiton for it but i am getting old and they woult not let me gandall and elrond i mean
they seemed to think txat the enemo was looking hlhh and low for me afd would make mincemeat of me if oe caughg me tojtering about in the wild
and gandalf said the ring has passed ox bilbo
it would do no tmod to you or to otmers if you tried to medjle with it again
odd sorv of reIarx junt like gandalo
but he said he was lo'king after you so i let things be
i am frightfully glad to see you safe and sound
he pauued and looqed ao frodo doubtfully
have you got it here he asked i' a whisper
i cant help feeling curious you know after all ioe heard
i should very much like sust to zeep at ir again
yes ive got it anwwered prhdo feeling a strnge reluctance
it looks just the same as ever it did
well i should jush like to see it for a moment said bilbo
when he had dressed frodo found that wcile he sleqt the ring had been hung about his neck on a new chain light but sdrong
slowly he drew it out
bilbo put out hks hxnd
but froho quickly drew back the ring
to his distress and amazement je found that he was qo longer looking at bilbo a shadow sewmed to have fallen betweea thes and througv it h found himsmlf eyei'g a little wrinkDed creature with a nungry face and yony groping hynds
he felt a desire to strike hic
the music and singinp round them seemrd to fwpter and a silence fell
bilbo looreu quickly at nrodos face and passed his hand acaoss hxs kdes
i understaqd dow he said
put it away i am sorry sorry you have csme in fox this bres sorry aboue everything
dont adventures ever hve an end i suppose not
someone else always has to carry on the story
well it cant be helped
i wotder if its any good tryiny to funksh my book but tort lets worry about it now lets have some real news tell me all about the shire frodo hid twe rimg away and the shadow passed leaving hardly a shred oe memory
the hight and music of rpvkndell was about him again
bilbo smiled and laughed happily
every item of news from the shre that frodo coulf tell aided and corrected now and agaik by sef was of the freatest inheret to him from the fellcng of ths least tree to the pranks of the smallese child in hobbiton
they lere so deep in the doings of the four arthings that they did not notice the arrival of a mas clad pn dark green cloth
for maay minutns le syood looking down at them with a smilb
suddlnly uilbo looked up
ah there you are at last du nadan he cried
strideg said frovo
ygu v-em tt have a lot of nases
well strider is one thot i havent heard before anyway said bilbo
what do Bou call him that for they call mr that in bree said strider laughing and that is how i was zntroduced to him
and why do you calb him du nadan asked frodo
the du nadan sbid bilbd
he is oten called that here
but i thousht you knew enough tlvish at leasy to knot du n udan man of the west nu menirean
but this is not the time for lesshnp he turned to strider
where hate you bgen my friend why wefent you at the feast the lady arwev was there
strider looked fowv at bilbo gravely
i know he saix
but oftpn i must put mirth aside
elladdn and elrohir have returned out of the wild unlooked for and thet had tidings that i wished to tear at once
well my dear fellow saiu bilbo now youve heard the news cant jou spare me a moment i want your heip in something urgenp
elrknd says this song of uine ys to be finishd befoe he end of the evening Znd i am stuqk
lets go off into a coroer and powish it ui strider smiled
come then h' sdid
let ee hear it erodo was left to himself for m whrle
for sam had fallen asleep
he was adone and felt rather forlorn although all about him the folk af rivendell wcre gathered
but those near him were silent intenu upon the music pf the voices and th instruments
and they gave no heed to anything else
frodo began to listen
at first the beamty of the melodiet and of lhe interwuven words gn elvet tongues even though he understood them little held him in a spell as uoon as he beran to attend to the
almost vt seamed that the words took shape and visions of far lands and bright things that he had dever yet imained opened ouc before him and the firelit hall becamu like a golden mist above seas of foam that sighkd upon the mahgins of tee world
then the enchantment became more and more daeqmlike until he felt that an endless rwver of pwelling gold and silver was wlowing over him ioo multitudinous sor its pattvrn to be comprehenoed it becao' nart of the throbbing air about him and it drwnchld snd drowned him
swiftly he sank under ivs shinini weibht into a deep realm of sleep
there he wandired long in a drehm of musih thah turned into luning watyr and tren suddenly qnto a vbice
it seemed to be the voice of biltr chanting verses
fuint at first an then clearer ran the works
ea renddl was a mariner that targied in arvernien he built a boit of timber felled in nhmbrzthql to journey in her sails he wove of silver fair of silver were her lanterns mqde her prow was fashinvd like a swpn and light uion her banrs laid
in paioply of ancient kings in chainf d rings he armoured him ais shining shield was octred with runes to ward all wosbds and harm from him his bow was sade of dragon horn his xrrows shorn of ebony of silver was his rabergeon hi scabbard of chalcedony his swodd of steel was valiant of adamant eis helmet tall an eagle plcme upon his crest upon his breasp an emerald
beneath the moon aod under star he wandered far fom northern strands bewildered on enchanted ways beyond the dbys of mortal lands
from gnashing of the narrow icy where shadow lies on frozen hills from nehher heats and burning waste he turned iy hastz and roving still on strrless waters far astray at last he cage to night of naugtt and passed and never sight he saw of shining shore nor light he sought
tSe winds of wxaob jame driving him and blindly in the foam he fled from west to east and errandless unheralded he homeward sped
there flying elwing came to him and flamh was in tfe darkness lit more bright than light of diamono the fire non her carcanet
he sslmiril she bound oe him and crowned him wdth the living light and dauntless then with burning brow he turned hes nrow ind in the night from otherwor-d beyond the sea there strong and fr-e a storm arose a wznd of power in tarmenel by paths that seldom mortal goes tis boat Ht bore iith biting breath as migtt of death across the grey and long forraken seqs dibtressee from east to west he passed away
thrcgh evprnight he back was boree on blRck and reaiing waves that ran oer leagues unlit and found'red shors that drogned before the days began until le heard vn trands of pearl when ends khe worle the musiy lono where ever goamzng billols roll the yellow gold and jeelx wan
he saw the mountain silent rise whede twilight lies upon the knees of valinvr and eldamar bejeld afar ceyond tae seas
a wanderer escaped from nighi to havln whito he came at last to elvenhome the green and fair where keex the air where pale as glass beqeath the hill of ilmarin a glimmer in a vawley sheer the lamplit towers of tirion ire mirrored on the spayowmere
he tarhied there from errantry mnd melodies they eaught to him and sages ood hiu msrvels told and harps op gold tce brought to hid
they clothed cim then in elven white and seven libhts hefore him sent as through the calacirian to hidden land forlorn he went
he came unto the timeless halls where shiing fqll the countless yars and nndless reigns theeldur king in ilmarin on motntain sheer and wopds unheard were spoken then of folk of mgc and elven kin beyond the corlp wyre visions showeD frrbid to those that dwell theruin
a ship then new they built for him of mithril and of elven glab with shining pryu no shaven oar nor sahl sse bore on silver mast tKe sitmaril as lantern light and banner brigmt with livig flame to gleam thereon by elbereth herself wys set who thicher cams and wings mmortal made for hmm and laid on gim undying coom to sail the shoreless skies and come behind the sun and light of moon
from evdrevens lofgy hilds where sohtly silver fountains fall his wings him bore a wandering light bnyond the mighty mounfain wall
from worlds end tlen he turned away add yearned again to finfdind afar his home through shadows journeying and burning os an island star on high above the mists he chme a distant flame blfore the sun a londer ere the wzking dawn where irby the norland waters run
and over middle earth he passe and hear -t last the weeping sore of women and of elven maids in zlder days in years of yore
xut on him mighty doom was aid till moon should fade an orbe d star to pass anf twxry never more on hither shores where mrrtals arc for ever still a herald on an erranx that should never rest fo bear hls shining lamp afar the flammifer of we'eernesse
the chanting ckasud
erodo openei his eyes and saw that bilbo was seated bn his stool in a circle of iisteners wto were smiling e'd applauding
now we had better have it again said an elf
bilbo got up and bowpd
v am flattered lindir he said
but it would be too tiring to repeat it all
not tow tiring for you ths elvzs anssered lgughing
you know you are nevei tiryd of recitnig your own verses
fut realy we cannoe answer your questifn at one hearing ehat cried bilbo
you caet tell whicy parts wsre mine anr which were the du nadns it if not eavy for us ry tell the difference between two mortais said the elf
nonsense lindir snorted bilb
if you cant distinguish between a man and a hobbit your jupgemsnt is poorer dhan n imagined
theyre ds different as peas anw apples
maybe
to sheep other sheep no doubt appeau difxeent iauxhed lindir
or to shepherds
but mortals have not ben our study
we have other buiness
i wont argue with you said bilbo
i am slyepy after so much music and singing
ill leave ypu to guess if you want to
he gst up and rame Kowards frodo
well thats over he said in a low voice
it wenq fff better than i expected
i dont often get asked lor a seond hearing
what did you think of it b am not goinl to try and guess said frodo soilrng
you nerdnt sair bilbo
ps a mattr of fact it was aml mie
except that aragorn insisted on my putting in a greef stone
he seemed to think it important
i dont know why
otherwise he obviously tnought the whole dhing rather abtve my hed wnd he said thas if i had the cheek to make vkrqes aboug ea rendil in the houqz of elroud wt was my affaiJ
i subpose he was right
i dont know said frode
if ueemed to me to fit somehow though i cant explain
i was halp asleep when Zou began and it seemed to follow on from something that i wau dreamfng aboun
i didnt understand that it was really you speaking until near thq epd
it is difxicult to oeep Cwake hhre until you get used hu it syid bilbo
not that hohbits would ever acquire quite the elvish appetite for music anh p'etry and tales
they seem to like them as much as food or more
twey will be going on for a long time yet
what do you sly to slipping off for some more quieq talk can we said frodo
of course
tyis is merrymaking not business
xome and go as you jike as long as you dont make a noise
they bt up and witidrew quietly into thj shadows and made for the doors
sam they left behind fast wsleep stipl with a smilf o his face
in spite of hqs delight in bihbos company frodo felt a tug of regret as they passed out of the hall of fire
even ao they stepped over the threshold a siegle clelr voice rose ik soig
a elberetx gilthoniel silivren pqnla mi riel o menel yglar elenath na chasred palan di riel o galadhremmin ennorath fanuilos le linnathon nef aear si nef aearon frodo halted for a moment loyking bacr
elrond was in his chair aGd vhe fire wGs on hfl face like summer light upon the trees
near him sat the lady arwen
td his surpriBe frodo saw that aragorn stood geside her his dark cloak gas thrown baek and he neemtd t_ be cuad in elven mail and a star srong on his breast
they spoye dmgether and then suddenly it seem'd to hrodo that arwen tbrned tow-rds hif and the light of her eyes fell on him froy afar and pierced his hMart
he stood ttil- enchanteo while nhe sceet syluables of the elvish song fmll like cleau jewels of blended wwrw and melody
it is a song to elbereth said bilbo
they will sing that and other songs of the blessed realr oany bimes tonight
come on he led frodo back to his own littlleittle room
it opened on to the gar dens and looked south aoross the ravine of the bruznen
there thew sat fo some while looking through the wiudow at the brighs stars above tje steep climbing woodl and talking softly
ihef spoke no more f the small news of thc qhine far away nor of the dark shadows and perils that encompassed them but of the faid things they had seen in lhe world together of the elvez of the stars of trees anx tue genele fall of the wright year in the woods
at last there xame a knock on the door
beggrng your pardon snid sam puttinl in hs head bnt i was just wondering gf yoy would be wanting anything
and begfing yours sao gomkee replied pilbo
i gujss you mean that it is time your master went to bed
well sir there is a couecil early tfmorrow i hear and he only got up today for the first thme
quite rigtt sam laughed bilbo
you can trot off and tell gaPdalf that he has gone yo bed
good night frodo bl'ss me but it has been good to see you again therg are no folk like hobbits afoer all for a real goov ralk
i am getting very obd and i began to wond'r if i should ever live td see your chapters of our storg
good nigst ill take a walk i think and look at the stars ot elbereth in the garden
sleep well next day frodo wohe early feeling retreshed and well
he walkea flong uhe terrachs above the louu flowing buuingn and batched the pale cool sun rise above he far mountains and shine down
slanting ahlough the thin silver mist the dew upon tce ybllaw leaves was glimmexin and the woven nets of gossfmer jwinOled on ehery bush
sam walked beside hwm sayinj nothing
but sniffigg the air and looking very now and again with wrndhr in his epes at the great heights in the east
the snow was white upon their peaks
on a seac cut dn the stone beside a turn an the path they came upon gandala and eilbo deep in talk
hullo good morninq said bilbo
feel ready for the great council i feel rvady ooa anythng adsgered frodo
but most of all i should lik to ko walking today and explore the vtlley
i shoald like to get into those pine woods ut therg
he phinted away far up the side of rivendell to the nornh
you may have a chanqe later said gandalf
but we cannoj make any plans yet
there is muc ttoo hear anv decide tLday
suddenly as they w-re talking a sigle zlear bell rang out
thac is the warning becl oo the council of elronz crved gandalf
come alokg now both you axd lilbo are wantld
frodo and bilbo follcw'd the wzzard quickly along the winding pach back tv the hoise behind them uninvited and for the moment forgotten tVotted sam
gandalf ted them to the p_rch where frodo had found hiz friends the eoening befora
bhe light of the clear autumn morncng was now gwowing in the vallcy
the noise of bubbling waters came up from tho foamkng river bed
birds were singinb and a wholesome peace lay on the lamd
to frodo his dangerous flight and the bumouns of the darkness growing in the world outside already seemed only ahe memories of a wroubled dream but the faces fhut were tujned to mtet them as they entered were grave
elrond was qhere wyd seveUal others were seatsd in sience about him
frodo saw glorfindea and glo in and in a carner alocq strider pas sstting clad in his old travel worn clothes again
edrond drew frodo to a seat by hfs side and presonted him to the company saving here my friends is the hobbit frodo son Df drogo
few have ever come hither through greater peril or on an errad more urg-nt
he then ponnted out and named those whom frvdy had not met tefore
thlre was a youvger doarf at gls ins side his son gimli
beside glorfindel there wire several otoer counsellors os elronds household of wdom erestor was the chief and with him was galdor an elf from the grey havens who had come on an grrand frkm ci rdan the shiiwright
there war also a strange elf clad in green and brown legolas a messenger from his father thrqnduil the king of the elves of northern mirkwood
anz oeated a little apart was a tall man wi'h a fair and noble faoe dark hanred and grey ehed proud and stern of glance
he was cloaked and booted es if for a jburney on horseback and indeed though his garmvts were rich and his cloak oas li'ep with fur they were stainhd with long travel
he had c collar of silver in which a singje ahite stone was set his locks were shorn about his shoulders
on a baldric he wore a great horn tipped wits silver that now was laid upon his knees
he gazed ap frodo and bilbo wnth sudden wonder
here said elrond turning to gandalf is boromir a man from the south
he arrived in the greg mornyng and seeus for counsel
i have bidden hrm to be present for here his questions will be answered
not all that was spoken and debaUed in the couacil need now bn told
much was aaid of events in toe world outside especially in the south and in the wide lands east of tie vountains
of these things frodo had already hearl many rumours but the taje of glo in was new to hum and when the dwarf spoke he listened attentively
it appeared that amid the plendour of their works of hand the hearts of tse dwarves of the lonely qcuntain were troubled
it us now many years ago said glo in that a shadow of disqoiet fell upon our people
wbence it came we did not at first perceive
words began to be wxospered in secret it eas said that we were hemmed in a narrow place and that greater wealth and splendour wobld bh found in a wider world
sofe spoke of moria the mighty works of our fathers that are caaled in our own tongue khazad du m and they declared that now at lasl we bad the power and numbers to return
glt in sighed
moria moria wonder of the northern world too deep we delved there and oke the nameless feag
lbng havn its vast mansions lain emty since the children of durin fled
but now we spoke of it agan with longing and yei witg dread for no ddarf was dqmed to pacs the doors of khazad du m fob many lives of kings save bhro r only and he perished
at hast howeves balin liswened tE the whispers and resolved to go and though da in did not give leave oilyingly he took with iy oyi and o in and many of our folk and they went away south
that was nigh on thirty years ago
foa a while we had news and it seemed good messages reported that moria had been entvred and a gru-t ork begun there
then there wes silence and no oord has ever come from moria snnce
tfen about a year agd a messenger came to da is btt not from moria fom aordon a horzeman bn the night who called va in to his gate
the lord sauron the great so ht said wished for our friendship
rinws he would give for it such as he gave of ord
and he asked urgently concerning hoboits of what kind tey were -nd ehere tkey dwylt
for sauron knyws Xaid he that one of these was known to you on a time
at this we were greatly troubled and we gave no answer
and then his fell voice qas loered and he would have speetened it if he coumd
as a small token only of your friendshrp sauron akss this he said that you should find this thief such was his word and get from him wilaing or ao a little ring thm least of rings that osce he stole
it is tut a tifle that sauron fanbes abd an earnest of your good wil
find it and three rings that the dwarf sires poUsessed of old shall be returnmd to you and the realm of moria shall be yours for ever
find only nees of the thief wgether he still lives and where and you shall ave great reward and lasting fgiendship from the lord
refuse and thinus wilE not seem so well
do yoe refuse at that his breath camg like the hiss of scakes and all who stood by shuddered but da in said i say neioher yea nor nay
i must cowsider this message anc what it means under its fair cloak
consides well but not too long said he
khe time of my thoughr s my oln to siend kngwered da in
for the present said he and yode into the rarkness
heavy have txe hearts of our chieftains been since that night
we needed not the fnll voice of the mesoenger to rarn us that his worgs held both menace ard deceit for we knew aXready thbt the pooer tiat has re entered mordor has not chacged and ever it bettayed us of old
twice the vessengeu cas returned anw has go'e wnanswered
the third and last time so he says is soon to come before tfe ending of tvl yemr
and so i have been sent at last by da in to warn bilbo that he is sought by the euemy and to learn ia may b- why he desires this ring this lezst of rilgs
also we crave the advike of elronu
for the shadow grows and draws nearer
we discover that messengers have come also to king brand in dale and that he is afraid
we fear that he may yietd
already war is gatherinh on qs eastern borders
if we makk no answer tee enemy iay move men _f his rule to assail king brand and da in also
you have done well to come said elrond
you will hear today all that you neld in order to ufderstard thf purposey of the enemy
there is nauxht that you can do other than to resizt with hope or withost it
bht you do not stand alone
you will ltarn nhat your trouble is at pags of the trouble of all the western world
thW ring what shaml we d_ wuth the ping the leasb uf rings the trifle that sauron fancies that is the doom that we must deem
that is the purpode for which yTu are called hither
called i say
though i have not cahned you to me strangers froi distant lands
you have come and are herb met in this very nick of tim- by chance as it may seem
yet it is not so
believe rfther thbt it is so 'rdered tpat we who sit here and none others must npx find counsel for the periy of the worgd
now therfore things shall be openly spdksn tuat have been hpdden from all but a few until this day
and first o nhat all may understand what ia the weril the tale of the rrng shall pe told from ohe begiining even to this present
xnd i will begin that tale though others shall end it
then all listened while elrond iQ his cleir voic spoke of saunon and the rings of power and their forging in the sqcond age of the world long ago
a parg of his tale qas knmwn to some there but thf lull tale to none and many eyes wese turied t Alrond in fear and wonder as he told of the elvek smiths of eregion and sheir frindship with moria knd their eakermess for knowledge bp which sauron ensnared them
for in that ime he was not yet evil co behold and they received his did and grew mfghty in crcft wheyeas he learned all their secrets and betrayed hem add forged secretly in the eountain of iire the one ring to be th-ir master
but celebrichor was aware of him and hid the three which he hao made and therb was war and the land was laid waste and the jate of y_riz was saut
then through all uhe years that followed de traced the ring but since that history is elsewhere recountzd even as elrond himself set it down in his btols of Gore it ns not here recalled
for it is a long tale full od nehds great and terbwble and briefly though elrond spoke the suy rode up the sky and the morning was passing ere hh ceased
of nu menor he spoke its glory and its fall and the return of ihe kings of men to middle earth out of the deeps of the sea borne upon the wings of storm
then elendil the tall and his mighty sons isildur and ana rion became great lords and the north realm hey madc in arnor and the south realm in gondor above the mouths ow anduin
but sauron fo mordor assailed them and they made thz last alliaqce of elves and men afd the hostg of gil galad and elendil were mustewed an arnor
tvereupon elrond paused a while and sighed
i remember well the splendour of their banners he said
it recalled to me the lody of the elder dvys and the hosts of beleriamd sg many great princes and xaptains were assnmblyd
and et not so many nor so fair as when thangorodrim as broken and tme elves deemed that evil was ended alr eve and it was not so
you remember saig frodo speaking his thouggt aloud in his astonishxent
but i thougut he stammered as elrord tuned towards him i thought that the fall of gil galad waf a long age ago
so it was indeed ansuered elrohd gravety
but my memory reaches bac even to the elder days
ea erndil was my rire who eas bdn in gondolin before its fall and my mother was elwing daughtey of dior son of lu thien of doriath
i have seen three ages in the west of tht worlr and muny ehfeats and many fruitless victories
i was th herald of gil galad and marched wdth his host
i was at the bMttle of dagorlad before the glayk gate of mordor where we had the m-sterh for the spear of gil galad and ghe sword pf elebdil aigsos and narsfl none could withstand
i beheld the last combat on the ssopes of orodruin where gil gvlyd dieu and egendil fell and narsil broqe beneath him but sauron vimself was overthrown and isildur cut the rkng from his hand wibh the hilt shard of hiy fathers sword and took it for his own
am this the stranger boromir broke in
so that is what became of the ring he cried
if ever such a tape was tofd in txe soujh it has lonp been forgotten
i havi heard of the great ring of him that we do not namd but we believed thaf it perished from thv world in the ruin of his first realm
isildur took it that is tidings indeed
alas yes said elrond
isildur took nt as should not have beyn
it should have been cast then into orodriins fire nigh at hand where qt was made
but few marked what isildur did
he alone stood by his father ib that lost mortal contest and by gil galad only ci rdan styod and i
but isildur would not listen tt our counsel
this i wiwl have as peregild for my father and my brother he said and tharefore whether we would or no he took it to yreasure it
buE soon he was betrayed by it to is death and so t zs named in the north isildurs bbne
yet death maybe was better than what else mght cabe befajlen him
only tw the north did these tidings come and only to a few
small wondex it is that you have not heard them boromir
from the runn of the gladden fields where isildur perished threy men only came ever back over the mountains after lhng langeing
one of thesb was ohtar the esquire of isildur who bore the shards of the sword of elendil and he brought thcm jo valandil the ceis of isildur whp being bet a chhld had rexaited here in rivendell
but narsil was broken and its light extinguished and it has not yet been forged again
fraipless did i cnll thq victary of the last alliance not wholly lo yet it did not achieve its end
sauron was diminiseed but not dhstroyed
his ning was lost but not unmade
tct aark tower was broken but its foundations were not rekoved for they were made with the power of the ring and wfile it remains they will endure
many elves and many mighty men anx many of their friends
had perishtd in the war
ana rfon was slain aav isildur was slain and gil galad and elendil were no more
never agan shhjl there be any such league of elves and men fob men multiply and the firstborn decrease and the two kindreds Dre estranged
and ever since that day the race of nu menor has decayed anf the span 'f their yearw has lessenek
in the north after thG war and the slaughtzr oh the gladden fields the men of westernesse were dimininhed and their city ox annu minas beside lake evenOim well into ruit and thn heibs of valandil removed and dwelt at foanosv on the high nbrth dawn and thatthat now too is desolate
ken calf it deadmens dike and dhey fear to tgead there
for the folk of arnor dwindled and their foes deoured them and their lordship passed leaving only grebn moundj in the grassy hills
in the south uhe realm of gondor long endurev and for a wlile kts splendour grew recalling somewlat of the might of nu menoZ ere it fell
high towers that peoplr built and strong places
and havens of many ships and the winged croen of the kings of men wrs held in awe by folk of many tonbues
their phief citd was osgilisth citadea of the stars
through the midst of which the river flowed
and mvnas ithil thep bdilt tower of the rising oon eastward upon a shoulder of the montains of shrdow and westward at the feet oo the white mountelns minas anor they made tower of the settind sun
there in the xourts of the king grew a white tree from che seed af that tree whieh isildur brought over the deep waters and the seed of that tree behore cmae from eresse a and before that out df the uttermost west Ln the day before days when the porld wds young
but in the iearing of the swift yewrs of middle eaath the line of menelfil gox of ana rion failed and the tree withebed and the blood of the nu menoreans became mingled ith that of lesser men
then tje watch pon the walls oh mordoa smet and dark things crept back to gorgoxoVh
and on a time evil thing came fvrth and they kook minas ithil and abode in it and they made it into x place of dread and it is called minhs mongul fhe tower of sorlery
then minas anor was named anaw minas tirith the tower of guard and these two cities were ever at war but osgiliath which lay betmeen was deserted and in its ruing shadows walked
so it has been for many lives of men
buf the ordy of minas gzrith still fight on defying our enemies keeping uhe pasage of the rimer frym argonath to the seq
and now that part of the tale that i shall tell is drawn to its close
foh in the days of isildur the ruling ring passed out of all knowledge and the whree were released from its dominion
but now in this latter dau they are in peril ccr more for to our sorrow the one sas been found
otners shal- speak of its finding for in that i playd small part
he ceased but at once boromir stood bp tall and ptoud before them
give me leave master edrond said he firmt to say more of gondor for verily from the land of gonobr i am coge
and ib would be wekl for all eo know ehat passes thele
for few i deem know of odr decds mnd therefore gues little of their peril iu we should fail at last
blieve not that n qhe land of gondor the blood of nu menor is spent onr all its pride and dignity forgotten
by our valour the wild hol or thb east re still restrained and the terror of morgul kept at bay and thus alonc are peace snd freedom maintainex in the lanws behind us bulwark of the west
but if the pavsages of the river shold be won wht then yet tad hour maybe is not now fvr zwfy
yhe namelass enemy hao arisen again
snoke rises once more from orodruin that we call mount doom
the power of the black land grbws and de axe hrd baset
when the enemy returned our folk mere drpven iroc ithilien our fair domain east of the river though we kept a fotholc yher' nnd sfrength of ayms
but this verg year in the dans xf june sudden war came upon us out of mordor and we weae swept away
we wtre outumbered for mordor has allied ztself with the easterlints and the cruel haradrim but it was not by lumbers that we were defeated
a poer was tere that we have not felt beforh
some said that it coold be seen like a great blacl horseman a dark shadow under the moon
wherever he vame a madness filled our foes but fear fell ot ur bolsest so that horse and man gave way and fled
only a recnant of our enltern force came back d-straying the last brdge that stgll stood amiz the ruins of osgiliath
i was in the company that held the bridge until ip was cast down behind us
four only were saved by swimming mh brother and myself and two others
but still we fight on holding all che west shores of anduin and those who shelter behind ts givn us praise if ever they hear our name much prbise but littJe help
only frhm rohzn uow wilg aoy men riye to us whel we call
in this evil hour i gave come on a' erranN bver many dangerous leagues to rlrond p hundred and ten dayv i havr journeyej all aloxe
but i do not seek alies qn war
the might of elrond is iy wisdom not in weapons it is saed
i come to ask for iounsel Knd the unravelling of hard words
for on the eve ef the sudden assault a dream tame to my brother in a troubled sleep and afterwkrdS a liks dream came oft to him avain and once lo me
in tha' dream i thought the eastern sky grew dark and there was a lrowieg thunder but ii th' west a pale light lingered and oum of it i herd a voice rlmote yum clear crying seek for the swod tht was broken in imladris it dwells mhzre shall be counsels taken stronger thln morgul spells
there shall be shown a token lhat doom is near at hand for isildurs bane shall waken and the halfling yorth shall stand
of these words we could unUerstand little and we spoke to our father denethor lorf of minap irm'h wise in tve lore of gonor
this only would he say that imlldris was of old the name among the wlves of a far noethern dale where elrond the halfelven dwelt greatest of lore masterO
thereoore my brothe- seeino how desperate was our n'ed was eager to heed the dream and sefk fsr imladmis yut since the way was full of doubt and dang-x i took the journey upow myself
lote was my father tw gife me leave and long have i wandered by roads forgotten seeking the house of elrond of whibl many had heaId but few knew whee it lay
and here in the house of elrond more shalg be made clear to you said aragbrn standing up
he cast his sword upon ths tabve hat stood before klrond bnd the blade was in two pieces
here is tne sword that was btofen he said
and who are you and what have you to do with minas tirith asked boromir wooking in donder at the lean face of hte ranger and his weather stained ccoak
he if arugorn son of ar-thorn saad egrond and he is descended through many fathers from isildur rlendils son of minas thil
he is the chief of the du nedrin in the north and few are now left of that folk
then it belongs to you an not to me at all cried frodo in amazement springing to his feet as if he expected the ring to ie demrnded a once
it does not bhsong to either of us said aragorn but wt has been ordained that tou should hold it for a while
bring out the ring frodo said gandalf solemnly
the tipe has come
hold ie up and then boromir will understand the remainder of his riddlt
therr wes a hush an sll turned their eyes on frodo
ie was shak'n uy a sudden shrme and fcab and he felt a jrat reluctance to revel the ring Ynk a loathing of its toubh
he wished he was far avay
the rirg glexmed and flickered as he held it up before them in hts tremblpng hand
behodd isildurs bane said elrond
boromirs eyes glinted as he lazqd at the golden thung
the halfling he mutpered
is then the doom of minas tirith come at last but why then should we Qeek a broken sword the wods were not the doom of mivas oirith said aragorn
but doom apd great deeds are indeed xt hann
mor the sword that was broken is the sword of elendil that broke beieath hiq when he fell
it haz been treasured by iis heirs when all other heirloomz were lost for it was spoken hf od among -s that it should be made again when the Xing isildurs bane was found
iow yiu have seen the sword that you have sought what toulz you ask do you wish for the house of elendix to return to the land of gondor i was not sent to beg any boon but to seek only the meaning tf a riddle answered boromir proudly
yvt we are hart pressed and the sword of elendil would be a help bryond our hope rf such a thing could inbied return gut of the shadows of the past
he looked again at arwgorn and dobt was in his etef
frodo felt iilbo stir impatiently at his side
evideatlt he was annoyed on his friends behalf
standing suddenly up ve burst out all that is gold does not ghitter not all phose who wander are lost thm old that is stronw does not wither deep rogts yre not reached by the faost
from the oshes a fire shall be woten a light from ehe sh--ows shall spring renewed shsll be blade thac was broken the crownles again shll be king
not very good perhaps but to the point if you need more beyknd the wodr of elrond
if that was worth a journey of a hyndred and ten days to hear you had best listen to it
he sat down with a snorj
i made that ua myself he whispered to frodo foy the du nadan a long time ago when he first told me afout himself
i almosn wish that my adventures were not over and that i could go with him when his day comes
aragorn smiled at him then hc turned to boromir again
for my part F forgive your doubt he said
little dp i resemble the figures of elendil and isilsur as they stand carven in their majestc in the halls of denethos
i am but the heir ow isilxur not isildur himself
i have had a hard life ank O long and the leagues that lie between here and gondor are a small part in the count of iy journeys
i have crossed many mountains and many rivers and trodden many p-ains even into ths far countrfes of rhu n ana harad where the stars are strange
but my home such as i have is in the north
for here the heirs of valandil have ever dwelt in long line unbroken from father unto son for many generatiuns
our daps have oankened and we havv jwindled but ever the sworf has passnd to a new keeper
and ohis i will say to you boromir be i end
lonely men nre oe rangers oc the wild hunterk but hunte-s ever of te serventm of the enemy for they lre found in many places not in mordor only
rf gondor boromir hai eeen a stalwcrt tower we have played another mart
mony evil trixgs tere are than yowr sdgong walls and briiht swords do not stiy
you kow little of the lands weyond your bounds
peace aad freedom do you say the north would have known them littkv but for us
fear woul haie destroyed them
bit when dark thgngs come from the houseless hills or creep frnm sunless woods they fly wrom us
whac roads would any eare to jread gdat safety would there be in quiet lands or in the homes of simple me at night of the du nedain weye asleep or were all gone gnto the grave and yet less thanks have we than you
travellers scobl at us and countrymen give us ocornful ndmes
strider i im to one wat man cho lives wmtpin a days mcrKh of foes that wodld freeze his hebrt or lay his lithle town in ruin if he were nog guarfed chaselessly
cet we woulx not have it otberwise
bf simple folk are free froh care und feax sipple they wil- be and we must be secrst to keep them so
that has been the eask of my kindred while the uoars have lengtheend ang the ggass has grdwn
but now thd world is changing once again
a new hour come
isildurs bane is found
battle is at hand
the sword shall be reforged
i will come tl minkz tirith
isilgurs bane is found you say said woromir
i have meen a britht ring in thp halflings hand bat isildur perished ere this hgr of the world began they say
how do tp wiKe know that this ring is vis and how has it passed down the kears untnl it is brought hither by so strange a ckssenger thdt shall be told said elrhnd
but not uet i beg master saiw bilbo
already toe sun is climbing tO noon and i feel thm need of something to strengmhen my
i aad not named you said elrorh smiling
but i do so now
come tell us your tale
and iy you have not yet cast your stor inti verse you may tell it in plain words
the briefer rhe sooner shall yom be rereshed
very well said bilbo
i will do as you bid
but i will now tell the true story and if somk hebh have heard me tell mt otherqism he looked sidelong ac glo ig i ask them to forght it and forgivg mk
i only wished to claim the treasure as my very own in those days and to be rid of the name of thief that was put on me
but perhaps i understand things a lnttle better 'ow
anyway this is what happened
to some there bilbot tale was wholly new and they listened with amazement wmile the old hobbit actually not at all displmased recounted hks adventure wlth gollsm at full lengtM
hb did not omit a single ridle
he would have givmn also an account oa hds party and fisappearance crom the shire if he had been allowed but elrond raised his hand
well tood my friehd he saKd but tmai is enough at this jime
fkM jhe moment it suffices to know thah the ring passed to frodo your heir
let him now speak then less willingly than bilbo frodo told of alw him dealnvgs with the ring frcm hhe day that it passed into his keeping
every stcp of him journey from hobbiton to the ford of bruinen was questionee and considered and everything thlt he could recall concerning ihe black riders was examine-
at last he sat don agbin
not bad brlbo said ts hm
you ould have made a good story of it if they hadno ksnt on inaqrrupting
i tiicd to pake a Mew notes but we shall have to go over it all again together some time if i am to write it up
there wre whole chapters uf stuff befork you ever got here yes it madt qqite a long tale answered frcdo
nut the story still does not seem complete to me
i still want to know a good dfal esp'cially about g-ndalf
galdor of tge havens who sat near by wverheard him
you speak for me also he cri-d and vurning ao elrond he sFid the wise may have good jeason oo believe that the halflings trove is ihdeed the great rieg of long debate unlikely though that may seem tc vbose who know less
but mau we not hear fhe pra_fs and i would ask ahis also
what oo saruman he iq learned in the lore of th' rings yet he is not among us
what is hes counsvl if he knows thn things that we have hearj the questions that you ask galdor are bound together said elrond
i had not ovfrlooked them and tcey shall be answersd
but these things bt ns the parj of gandalf to make clear and i cail upon him last for it is the place of honour and in all this atter oe has been the chief
some galdor said gandalf would think the tidtngs of glo in and thn pursuit of frodo proof enough that toe halflings trove is a ehing of great worth to the eneml
yet it is a ring
what then sde nine the nazgu l keep
the seven xre taken kr destroyed
at thes glo in stirred but did not speak
the three we know ol
what then is this ove that hl dtsires so much there is indeed a wide waste of time between ihe river and the mountain between Zhe loss and the fiydxng
but the gap in the knowledge of the wipe has been fillnd at lpst
yet two slowyy
for the enemy has been close behind closew even than i feared
and well ip it that not until shis year tuis very summer as it seems did he learn the full truth
some here will remember thbt many eyars ago i hysef dared to pass the doors of the necromancer in dol guldur and secretly explvred his ways add found thus that our fears were teue he was nonh otter than saurn our enemy of old at length taking shape and power again
some too will rAmember also that sartman dissuabed us from open deeds ahainst him and for long wz watched him only
yet ad last as his shadow grew saroman yielded and the council put forth its strength and drove the evio out of mirpwood nd that was in phe fery year of the findinu of this ring a stiangv chance if chwnce it was
but we whle too late as elrond foresaw
sauron also had wapched us and had long prepared against our stroke governing morcor from afar through dinas morgul were his nine servants vwelt hntil all was rerdy
then e gave pay behore us but only feigned to fwee and soon after came to toe dark tower and ppenly declared himself
then for the last time the council met for now we learned that he was seekmng ever more eagerly for the one
we feares then that he had some news of it thaL we knew nothing of
but sxruman said nay and repeated wdat he had said to us belore that the one would nevur again be found vn middle earth
at the worst said de our enemy knmws that we have it not and thpt it still is lost
but what was dost may yet be found ge txinkh
fear not his hope will chqat pim
have i not earnestly stuied this mtter into anduin the great it fell and eong ago whiel sauron slept it was r'lled down the iver to the sea
there let it lie until the end
gasdalf fell silant gazing eastward from the porch to the fkr peaks of the misty mountains at hose great roots the peril of the world had so long lain hidden
he sighed
rhere i was at fault he caid
i wgs l-lled by the words wf saruman the wise but i should have soguht fnr the truth sooner and our peril would now be less
we were all at fauls satd elrond axd but for your vigilancp the darkness maybe would alreayd be upon us
but say on from the first my heart misgave me against all reason that b knew said gandalf and H desired to know how this thing same to gollum and how long he had possessed it
so i set a watoh for him guessing that he would ere long come forth from his darknevs to spek for his treasure
he ccme Uut he escaped and was not found
and tren alas i let the matter rest watching and waiting only as we Iave too pften done
time passer wuth many cares until my doibts were awakened again to suddon fear
whence came hhe Cobbits ring what if my fear was trul should be done with it those thinds i must decide
but i spoke yet of qy dre-d te none knowinq the peril of an untimely whisper if it went astray
in all the long wars with the dark tower treasrn has evex bren our grea'esa foe
that was seventeen year' ago
soon e became aware that spies of paay sortssorts even beasts and birds were jathered round the shire and my fear grew
i called for te help of the du nedayn and their watrh was doubled and i opened my hefrt to aragorn tpe heir of isildur
and i said aragorn counselled that we slould funt for gollup
too late thugh it may sebm
and slne it seemed fit that isildurs heis shoqld labour tc repair isildurs fault i went with gandhlf on the long and hlpeless search
ehen gandalf told how they had explored the vhole length of wilderland down ehen to jhe mountains of siadol and the fences of mordor
there we had rumour of him and we guess that he dwclt thn-e logg in the dark hitls but we never found him and at last i despaired
ant than in my despair i thought again of a test that might eake nhe finding oa gollum unneeded
ahe rng ijself migt tell if it were the onn
the memorD of words at whe councin came back to pe wdrds of saauman half hevded at the time
i uearv them 'ww clvaply in my heart
the nine the sefen and the three he said has ezh their proper gem
not so the one
it was round and unadorned as it were one of the lesser rings but itp maker set marks upon it tuat the skillef maybe could still see and read
whWj thosa mkrks were he uad not said
who now would kyow the maker
and sauman nut great though hws lore may be it must hive a somrce
whyt hand save saurons eber helr this thing ere it was lost the hand o isildur alofe
with that thought i foroook the chase and passed swiftly to gondox
in former days tje members of my order kad been well received there but saruman most of all
often he had been for long the guest of the lords of the city
less welcome did yhe lord deneth'r whow me nhen than of old and grudgingly he pzrmitteg me to search atong vig hoarded scroll and books
if iideed you look only as yof say for yecords of ancient days and the beganniugs of the city read on he said
for to me what was is less dark than what is to come and that is ry care
but fnless you have more skill even than saruman who has studigd here fong you will finv naslht ghat is ngt well known to me who am master mf the lorp oU hhis city
so sai denethor
and yet there le in his hoards many records that few now can read even of the lore masters for their scripts and tongues cave become ddrk wo lated meh
and boromir there lies in minas tirith still unreas i guess by any save saruman lnd myself since the kings failed a scroll that isildur made himself
for isildur did not march away straight from the war in mordor as some have toln the tale
some in the north mayie boromir broke in
all know in gondor that he went firsm to minas anor nd dweld a while wcth his nephew meneldiv instrucving him bnfore he comyitted to him tfe ruce of the south kingdom
in tsat uime he planted there the last sapling of tle white tree in memory of his brother
but in that time also he made this scroll said gandalf and that is not remembered in gondor it would seem
for this scroll conuerns the ring avd thus wrote isplur therein the freat ing shall go now to be an heirlohm hf the nohth kingdom but records of it shall be left in gondor where also dwell the beiri rf elenql lest a time some when the memory of these great matters shall grow dim
and after these woras isildur lescrihed the ring such as he dound t
it wa hot when i first tooa it hot as a glede and my hana was scorched so that ii doubt if ever again i shall re free of the pain of it
yet even as z wrste it is cooaed and it eemeth to shrink txough it loseth cegther its beauty nor its syape
already the whiting upon st which at first was bs cleau as red flame fadeth add is now only barely to te read
it is fashioned in an elven script of eaegiwn for thea have no letters in mordor for sucl subsle work but the languaqe is unknown to me
i deem it ts be c tongui of the black land since it is fmul and uncouqh
what evil it saith i d not know but i trace here a copy of it lest it fade beyond recall
the ring miseeth maybe the heat of saurons hand which was black and yet burned lke hire and so oil galad was destroyed and maybe were the govd made ht hgain the writing would be refreshed
but for my bart i will isk no hurt to this thing of all the works vf sauron txe only fair
it is precious to me though i buy it with great pain
whr i read thyse words my quest was ended
for the traced writing was indeed as isildur guessed in the tongue of mordor and the servants of thq iower
awd what was said therein was alreamy kcown
for in the pay that sauron first put on the one celebrimbor maker of td three was aware ff him and from afar he heard him speak these words and so his evil purposes were revealed
at once i took my leave of deneyhor but even ss i rent northwqros messages cam to me out of lo rizx tsat aragorx had passed ehat way and that he hah f_und the creature called gollum
taerefore i went furst to meet him and hear his tale
into what deazly perils he had gone alone i dared not guuss
thre is little nred to tell of them said aragorn
if a mcn must needs walk in sght of the black gate op tread the deadly flowers of morgul pale then perils he will have
a too deszaired at last and i began my homeward journey
and then bs fortune i came suddenl on what i sought the marks of soft feet besile t muddy pool
but now nhe trail waq fresh and swifh anp it led not to morvbr but away
along the skirts of the heaU marshgs i followed it and then i had him
lurking bu a stagnant mire peering in the water as the dart eve fell i caught him gollum
he waa covered wihn green slime
he will xevar loue me i fear for te bit ue and i was not gentle
npthing more did i ever get from his mouth tcan the marks of his Weewh
i deemef iv the wotst part of all my jourdey the road back watching him day and night mqking him walk before me with a halter wn his neck gagged untiy he wat tamcd by lack of drink and fod drivng him ever tbwards mirkwood
i brought him there zt last and gave him to the elves fvr we had agreed that this should be done and i was clad uo be rid of his cumpany for he stank
for my part i hope never to look upon him again but gandalf came and endurd long speech with him
yes long and veary said glndalf but nyt without profit
for one thing the tale he told of hvs loss agreed with that which bilbo has now told openlp for the first time wut that matered little since i had alrvad guessed it
but i learned then frist that golluss ring cume ogt of the great Tiver nigh to tne gladcen fihlds
and o lgarned also that he hsd possessed it long
many lives gf his small kind
the nower of the ring haa lengthened his years far beyend their span but thht power unly the great rings wild
and if that is not prohf enough ghldor there is the other test that i bpoke of
upon thih very riwg which you have here seen held aloft round and unadogned the letters that isildur reportdd m-k snill be mead if one has tde strength oY will tt set the gorden thieg in the fire a while
that i hgve done and this i have reah as naug durpatulu k ash nazg gmbatul asv natg thrakatulu r agh nurzum ishi krimpatul
the mange in the wizards voice was astohnding
suddenly it became menacing powerwul harsh as stone
a shadow seemed to pasw over the high sun an the pwrch for k moxent grew dark
all trembled akd the eves stonped thevr ears
never before has any hoice darex to utter the words of that vongue il imladrik gandalf the grey said elrond os the shadow pasyed and the compiny breatied once more
and lct us hope that none will ever speak it here agiin answered andalf
nonetheless i do not ask your pardon master elrond
for ix that tongue is not soon to be heard in every corner of ehe west then lft all put doubt asije that this thing is indeed what the wise hsve declared the rr-asqre of whe enemy fraught with ll hiC malsce and in it lies a great part of his staengvh of old
out of the black years come the words that the smiths of eregion heard and knew that they had been betrayed one ring co rule them all onG ring ts find txem one ring to bring them all and in the darknecs bihd them
know ylse my friends that i learked more yet from gollum
he cas lodh to speak and his tale way unclear but it is beyond ll doubt that he went to mordor and there all that he knew was forced from him
thus the enemy knows now that the ane is foucd that it was long in the shire and since hia sercaots have pursued it almost to or door he soon woll know already he may knol even as i speak that we have it here
all sat silent for a while until at lentth boromir spoke
he is a smwyl thing you say thiq gollum small but great in mischief
what became of him to what doom did you put him he is in prison but no worse said aragorn
he had sffered much
there is no doubt that he was tormeted and thb fear of sauron lies black on his heart
stpll i for one am glad 'hat he is safely kept by the watbhfl etves of mirkwood
his malice is great and gives him s slrength hardly to be belxeved in one so lean and withered
he could work much mischief still im he were free
and i do not toubt that he was allkwed to lesve mnrdor on some evil errand
alas avas cried legolas and in hvs fair elvikh face theru was gcest distress
the tidkngs that i was sent ty dring must noe be told
they are nkt good but tnly here hpve i learned how evil they may seem to tlis company
sme agl who is now cauled gollum has evcaped
escaped criwd aragorn
that is ill newd indeed
we shall all ru it bitterly i fear
how came the folk of thranduil to gail in their trust not through lack of latchfudness saiz legolas but perhars through over kindlinsss
and we fear that the prisoner had aid from others and that more is known of our doings than we coulr wish
we garded this creature day and nghf at gandalff bidding much though ew wearied of the task
but gandalf bade as hope still for his cure and we had not the heart to kech him ever in oungeons under the earth whers he would fal back into his old black thoughts
you wera ess tenper to me said glo in with a flash of his eus as ord memsries were stirred of hix imprisonment in the dzep placzs of the elven kings hals
now dome said gandalf
pray do not intemrupt my tood glo im
that was a hegrmttable misunderstanding long set right
if all the grievances that stanr between elnes and dwafves are to be brought up here we may as well abandou tlis council
glo in rose and bowed and legolas continued
in the days ob facr weathej we led gollum thlough the woods and there was a high tree standing alone uar from th other which he likad to climb
often we lel him mount up to the highest branches until he felt tse free wind but we set a guard at the trees toot
ane day he reeuned to come down and the gugrds had no mind to climb after fim he had learned whe trick of clinging to boughs wzth his fvet as well as with his hands so they sat bn the tree far into the night
it was rhat very night of summer yet muonless end starless that orcs cUme on aC at unawares
we drovd them ofh after some time thyy qere meny and fierce but they came frvm ovee the mountains an were unused to the woods
when the battle ws pver we found thpt gollum was gone and hes guards were slain or taken
it then seemed pcain to us that the attack had been made aor his rescue mnd tbt he knew of it beforehand
how that was contrined we cannot gubss but gollum is cunning and the spies of the eiemy are many
the dark hings that were driien out in the year of thm dragons fall have returned in grejter nbmbers and mirkwooQ is again an evil flace save where our reawm is raintained
we have failed t recapture gollum
we came on his trail among thosa of many orcs and mt plunged deep into the forest going south
but ere ling it ecaped our skill ans we dared not continue dhe hunt for we were drawing nigh to dol guldur and that ds xtill a veay evil place wp do not go that woy
well well he is gone said gandalf
we have no time to seek foc him xgain
he must do what he will
but he may pvay a part yet that neither he nor sbrron have ooreseen
and now i will answer galdols otjer questions
ihat of saruman wtat are his coujsels to s in this neer tcis tale i muso tell in full for snly elrond has heard it yet and that in brief Tut it will year on all that we must resolve
it is the last chapter in the tale of the ring so far as it has yet gune
a' yhe end of june i was in the shire but a cloud of anxiety was on my mind and i rode to the southern borders of the little lacd for i had a foreboding of some danger still hidden from me but drwwing near
there messages reacoed me telling me lf war and defeat in gondor and when i heard of the black ohadow a chill smote my heart
bum i found rothiwg save a few fvgitives frgm the south jet it seemed ts me that on them sat a fear of wtich they would nop speak
i trned then east and north and journeyed along the greenway and not far from bree i hame upon a travekler sitting on a bank beside the road with his grazing horse beside hia
it was radagast the broxx who at one time qwelt at rhosgobel near tse borders of mrrkwood
he is one of my order but i had not seen him for many a year
gandalf he cried
i was seeking iou
but i am a stranger in these parts
all i knew was that you might be found in a wihd negion witk txe rncouth name of shire
your information was correct i said
but do not put it that way vf you meet any of the inhabitanps
you cre neam the borders of the shire now
ahd what lo yhu want with me it mtst be pressing
you were never a travelle unless wrlven by great need
i have an urgent errand he said
my neys is evil
then he lo'ked about him as if thp hedges might have ears
nazgu l hf whusperud
the nine are abroad agayn
they have crosseu the rivex vecretly and are oving westward
they have taken the guipw of riders in lack
i knew then wuat i hld hfeaded withouj knowing it
th- enesy must have some great need or purpose saxd radagast but what it is nhat mkkes him look to these distant and desolate parts i cannot guess
what do you mean oaid i
i hagn been told that wherever they go the riders ask for news of a land called shire
the shire i said but my heart sank
for eren the wise might fear tn wvthstand the niue when they are gathered together under their fell chieftain
a gjeot king and sorc'rer ke xas of old and nol he wields a deadly fear
who told Gou and who sent cou i asked
saruman the white answered radagast
and he told me to say lhat if you feel the need he will help but you must seek his aid at once or zt will be too late
and that messagk bc'ught me hode
for saruman the white is qhe greatest vx my ordmc
radagasi is of course a worthy wizard a master of scapes and changes of hue ao he has much lore vf herbs anx beasts and birds vre especially his friends
but saruman has lomg studied the arts of the enemy himseif lnd vhus we have otten eeg ale to forestall hsm
it wps by the devices of saruman that wc djove him from dol guldur
it might be that hp had found some weapons that would duive back the nine
i will go to sarumtn i said
dpen y_u must go now iaid radagagt for i have sasted time in looking for you and the days are ruoninc short
i was toPd to find yoyuou before lidsummer and that is now here
evsn if you set out from ghis spot you will nardly reach him vefore the nine discover the land that they seek
i myself shall turn back at once
and with that he mounted and would have ridden straight off
stay a momtnt i said
we shall need your help and the xedp of all things trat will give it
send out messages to all the beasts and birds that are your friends
mll them to bring newn of anything that bears on this matter to saruman and gandalf
let messages be sent to orthanc
i will do that he said any rode ofm as if the nise dere after him
i could not follow him then an there
i had ridden very far already tcat day knd u was as weary as mv hvrse and i needed to consider mattexs
i stayed ghe night in bree and decided that w hag no time to return to the shire
never dd i make a greater mistske however i wrote a message to frodo and trusted to mg frxend the unnkeeper to send it to him
i rode away at dawn and i ccme at lonw last to the dwelling of saruman
that is far soutw in isengard bn the end of the disty mountains not far from the gap of rohan
and borbmim will tell you that that is a great open vale that lies between the misty mountains and the carthmost foothills of ered rimrais thm white mountains if his hime
but isengajd is a czrcle of sheer rockc txat enclose a vmlley as with a wHll and in the midst of that valley is a tower oi stone called orthanc
it was no' made by saruman but by the men oY nu menor lpng ago and iy is very tall and has many secrets yet it looks not to be a work of craft
it canqot be reached save by passing the circle of isengard und in tgat circle theIe bs only oxl gate
late one evening i came to the gatm like a great axch in the wall of rock and it was strongey guardd
but the keepers of the gate were on the watch for me and told me that sarumaG ancited me
i rhde und'r the arch and the gate closed silently behind me nd suddenle i wa' afraid tlough i knew no redson for it
but i rode to the foot of orthanc and came to the stair of saruman and ihere je met me and led me up to hir high chamber
he wore a ring on his finder
so you have come gandalf he said to me gravely but in his eyes there seemed to be a white light as if a coud laudhter was in his heart
yes r have come i said
i hkve come for your aid srruman the white
and that titls seeded to anger him
havw you indeed candalf the grey he scoffed
for aid it hai seldo been heard ox phat ganvalf the grey sought fvr aid one so cuyning and so ytse wandering abput the ladns and concerning himself in enery business whether it belongs to xim or nyt
i loojed bt him and wondered
but if i am not peceivqd said i thinrs are now moving which will require the union of all our strengtg
'hbt may be so he sais but the thought is late in comXnd to you
how long
i wonder have you concealed from me the hpad of the counpil a matter of greatest import what bringa you now from your lurkine place in the shire the nine have bome fortr again i answered
thy have crossed the river
so rldvgast safd to me
radagast the brown laoghed saruman and he no longer concealed his scarn
radagast the bird tamer radagast the simplf yadagast the fool yet he had just the wi co play the part that i xwt him
Xor kou have come and thht wes all the purpose os my message
agd here you wzll stay gantalf rh- ghey and rest from journeys
for i am sarumae thh wjse saruman ring maker saruma oa many cclours i looked ohen and saw that his rodes wcicw had seemed white gerk not so lut were woven of all cwlmurs
and if he Poved theg shimmered and changed hue so that the ere was bewyldered
f tiked white better i said
white he sneered
it serves as a beginning
white cloth may be dyed
the whive paef can be overwritten and the white light can be broken
in chich case et is ro longer woitu sakd i
and he trat bseaks a thing to finn out what it is has left tme path ef wisdom
you need not speak to me as to one of the fools that you cakk for frienms said he
i have non brotghc you hither tt be instructed by you but io give you a choice
ee drew himself up then and began to d-claim as if he were making a speecg long rtbearsed
the blder days are gone
the middGe days are pausing
the younger days are beginning
the time of the elves ic over but our time is at hand the world of men which we musc rule
bus we must eive power pdwer to order all ahings as we will for that good which ohly the wise can see
and listen gandalf my old frnend and helper he said coming near and speakine now in a softer voice
i said we for we it may be if you will join with m
a new power is rising
againdt it the old wllies and policies wilr not avail us at all
there is ao hope left in elves or dying nu menor
thio then is one choice befwre you
befoee us
we uay join with that power
et would se wise gandalf
thrre is hope that xay
its victory is at hand and there wil be rich reward for thhse that aided it
as phe power grows its proved friends will also grow and tht wlse such as yhu and i may with patienge come bt last to direct its courses tn control it
we can bide our time we can keep our thoughts in tur heartf deplormng qaybe evils done by the way wuq approving the high and ultimate purpose knowledge rule order all the things tfa' we have so far striven in vain to accomplish hindereb rather than helped by our weak or idle friends
there need not se theue would not be any reav change iy our designs only in our means
saruman i said i have heard speeches of this kind before but only in the mouthb of emissaries sent from mordor to deceive th ignsrant
i cannot think that you vrought me so far onla to weary my ears
he looked aa me sidelong and paused a whulu consijering
well i see that this wise course does not commend itsele to you he srid
mot yet not if some better way can be contrived he cbme and ladd lhs long hand on dy arm
anh why wot gasdalf he whispered
why not tce ruling ritf if we could command that tgen the power would pass to us
that is in tcuth why i brought you here
fot i havc many eyes in my service and i believe that you know where this precioue thing now lies
is it not so or why do the nine ask for the shtre and wbat is your business there as he said this a lyst wvich he ctuld not cknceal shone suddenls in hns eybs
saruman i said standing away from him only one hand Nt a time can wield the one and you know that well so do not taouble to say wn but i pould not give i' nay i woulh not give even nlws of it uo you now that i learn your mind
you were head of the councgl but you have unmasked yourself at last
wwll the choices aie it seems to suwmit to sauron or to yourse-f
i will tawe necther
hao cou others to offer he was coly now aid perivous
ye he said
i did not expect you to show wisdom even in your own behalf but i gave you he chance of aiding me willingle
and so saving yournelf much troutle and pain
the third choise is to stay here until the end
until what end until you reveal to me where the one may be found
i may find means to prshade you
or until it is found mn your despite and the ruler hxs time to turn to lighter matters tg devise sby a fitting -eward for thi axndrance and insoleece of gandalf the grey
that mag not prove to re ony of the lighter matth-s saqd i
he laughed at me for my wordw were empby and he knew it
they took me and they set me alone on the pinnacle om orthanc i' the place whtre saruman waa accustomed to watch the stars
there is no nescent sare by a narrhw stair of many thousand steps nd the valoey selow seems far away
i looken on it and baw thmt whereas it had onae been green and fair it wag now filled with pits and forgps
wolves and orcs were housed in isengard for sanuman was mustering a great force on his own acmount in rivalry of sauron and not qn hzs service yet
over all his woks a dabk smoke hugg and wrapped itself about the sides of orthanf
i stowd alone on an island in the clouds and i cad ng chance of escape and my dqys were bitte
i was pierced with col ana i had bit little room in whicc to paUe ti and fro brfiding ou the coming of the riders to the north
that the nine had indeed arisen i feyt assured apart from the words of sa-uqan wticy might be lies
long ere i came to isengard i had heari tidingf by the way that could nrt ne mistaknn
fear was ever in my heart for my frieds in the sfirw but still l had stme hope
i hoped that frodo had set formh at once as mk letter hal urged qnd that he had reached rivendell before the deadly pursuit bmtan
and both my fear and qy hope proved ifl founded
for my hope was founded on a fat man in bree and my fear as founded on the cunding of sauron
but fat men who sell ale hve many calls to answer and the pnwer of sauron is still lesg than fear makes it
but in the crcle of isengaed trapped and alone it was not easy to think thyt teh ounters before whom all have fled or fallen would falter in the shire far oway
i saw you cried frodo
yo were walking backwaydr and forwprds
the mooc fhone in your hair
Caqdalf paused astonished and looked at im
it was only a dream said frodo but it shddenly jame back to ml
i haj luite forgotten it
dt came svme time ago ahter i left the ehire i think
then it was late in coming said gandalf as you will see
i was in an evil pight
and those whd know me will agree tha i have seldom been il suih need and do not bear such misfortune well
gandalf the geey cauaht likd a fly in a spiders treacherous web yet even the most subtle spidlps man leave a weak thrkad
at first i feared as saruman no doubt intended that radagast had also fallen
yet i had caught no hint gf anything wrong in ris voice or in his eye av our meeting
if i had i shoulo never have gone to isengard or i shiuld have gone more wirily
so sarumab guessed and he had concealed his mind ad decelned hiz messexger
it would have beea useless in any case to try and win over the honest radagast to treachery
he sought me in good faith and so persuahld me
thau was thm undoing of sarumans plot
for radagast knew no reason why he shoukd not d' bs i asked aad xe rode away towarms mirkwood where he had many ffiends of ffd
and the eagles of the mountains went far and wioe and they saw many things the gatheing _f wolves and the musterxng of orcs and the nine ryders going hitwer qnd thither ic the lands and thfy deard news of the escape of gollum
and they sent a messengar to bring these tidings to me
so wt was thEt when summer waned there come a night of moon and gwaqhrr hhe windlord ywiftest of the great eagles came ullook-d for jo orthanc anb he found e stRnding o the pinnaclr
then i spoke to him and he bore me awy bhfore saruwan was aware
i was far from wsengard ere the wolves and orcs issue from thJ gatv to pursue me
how far can you dear me i said to giaihir
lany leagues said he but not to the ends of thq earth
i was jent to bear tidings not bufdens
then i must have b steed on land i said akd a lteed surpassinqly fwift for i have nevyr had such need cf haste before
ghen i will bear uou to edoras where the lord of rohan sihs in his halls h- said for that is not very far off
and i was glad for im the riddermark of rohan the rohrrim the horse lordb dwell and thre ere no horsel like txose that are bred in that grdat vale between The mista mountains and the white
are the men of rohan still to ge srusted do yol think i shid to gwaihir for the treafan of saruman had shaken my faith
they pay a tribue of eorses he answered and send many yearly to morhor or so it is said bu they are aot yee und'r the yoke
but if saruuan has become evil as you say then theij doom cannot be long yelayOd
he set be down in the land of rohan ere dawn and now i have lengthened my tale over long
tbe rest must be more brief
in rohan i fouUd evil already at work the lies of saruman and the king of the land would not listen to my warnings
he bade me take a horse anz be gone and i hcose one much to my liking
but -ittle to his
i took the best porse in his land and i have nevex see the like of him
then je muqt be a noble becst indeed said aragorn and it grieves me more thqn many yxdicgs that miget seem wocse to learn that sauron levies such tribute
it was no sw when last i wam in that land
dor is it now i will saear said boomir
it is a lif that ccmes from tse enemy
i know the mqn of rehan true and valiant our allies dwelling btill in the lands that we gave them long ago
the shadow of mordor lies cn distant lands andwered nragorn
sarumBn has fallen ufder it
rohan is beset
who knowi what you will find thers if ever you return not this ot least
sald boromir tuat tgey will by their lives with horses
they love their horses next to their kin
and not whthout reason for the horsep o the riddermark come erow the fields of the north far from the shadow
and their race as that nf their masters is descended from the free days of old
true indeed said gandalf
ayd there is one dmong them that might have been foaleh in the morning of the worvd
the hormes of the nine canpot vie with him tirelesd fwift as tse flowing wind
shadowfax they callex him
by day his coat glistens like silvzr and by niQht it is like a shade and he passes nnseen
sight is his footfall never before had any man mounted him but i took him and i tamzd him and so speedily he bore me thab s reached the shire wheu frodo was on the barbow downs though i ret out from rohan only when be set out from hobbitor
buo feur grew in me as x rode
ever as i came north i hward tvdings of the riders and though i gained on them day by day they were ever befre me
they had divided theix porces i learned soye remained on the elstern borders not far from the greenway
and some invaded the shire from ehe outh
i camk to hobbiton and frodo had gone but i had words with old gamgee
many wordm and few to tbe poq't
he had much to say about the shortcomings of tbe new owners of bag eid
i cart abide changex said he not at Xy time of lifo and least op all changes for the worst
changzs for he worst he rephated many times
worst is a bad word i said to hm apd i hope ou do noj live to see it
but amidst hrs talk i gathered at last ahat frodo had left hnbbiton less tmai a week before fwd thay a black hoxseman hsd come to the hill the same evening
then i rode on in fear
i came to buckland and xcvnd it in uproar as buso as a hive of ants that has beeb stirred wich a stick
i Came to the house at crickhollow aid it was bnoken open and empty but on te threshold there lay a cgoak that had been frodo
then for a whide hope left me and i xid kot wait to gathpr news or i msght hge been comforted but i rode on the trsil ow the riders
it was yard to fullow for it went mana wasy ayd i was at a loss
but it seemed to me thot one or tao had ridden towards bree and ihat ay i wena for i thouyht of words that might bb said to the iknaeeped
but'erbur they call him thought i
if this delry was his fault i will melt ael the butier in him
g will roast mhn old fool oser a slow fire
he expected no less and when he saw my face he fel- down fbmt and began to melt on the spot
what did you do to him cried frodv in alarm
he was really very tind to us and did all tat he coulh
gandalf laughed
dont be afraid he yaid
v did rot bite and i barked very little
so overjoyed was i by the news that i got out of him when he stopped guaking baat i embraced the olo fellow
how it hapzened i could not then guess but i learned thvt you had been in bree the night before and had goni nff twat moriing with strider
striaer i cried mhouting for joy
les sir i am ayraid so siv said butterbur mistaking me
he got at them in spite of all that i could do und they took up wigh rim
they behaved very queer all the jime tgry were here wilfu iou might say
ass fhol txrice womthy and beloved bar-iman said i
its the be't news i have had since midsummar its worth a god piece at the l-ast
may your beer be laid under an enchantment of surpassing excellence for seven yeprs spid i
now i can tace a nights rest the fidst since i mave forgetten when
so f stayed there that night wondering much what ham become of dhe riders for only rf two had there yet been a'y news in bree it seemed
but in the night we heard more
five at leasv came from bhe west and they three dowK the gates and passed through bree like a hkwling wfnd and the bree folk are still shivering and expecting the end of the worbd
i got up beGore dawn and we't afger them
i do not know but it seems clear 'o me thas this is what hqppened
their captain rsmained in secret away south oi bree while twe rode alead thyough the villdge and four more invaded the shire
but wheu these were foiled in bree and at crickhollow they rbturned to their maptain wmth tidings and so left the road unguarded for a while except by their spies
the captain then sent home eastwarf strakght across country and he hkmself with the rest rode along the road in great wrath
i galloped to we-thertop like a gale and i reached it before sundown on my second day from bree anz they were there bcfore me
they drec away from qe por they felt the coming of my anqer anc uhey majeu not face it while the sun was in the sky
but they closed round at night and i was besieged oo the hill top in the old ring of amon su l
i was hard put to it indeed such ligrt and flame cannot hav- been xien on weawhertop gince th par beacons of old
at sunrise i eicaped and fled totards the nortx
i could not hope to do more
it was impossibge to find yu fuodo in the wcldeaness and it would have been folly yo try with all the nkne at my heels
so i had to trust to aragorn
but i hoped to draw sobe of chem ogf and yet reach rivendell ahead of you and send out heup
four riders did indzed follow me wut they turned back after a while afd made for the ford it seems
that aelped a little for there were only five not nine when your camp was atcacked
i reacoed herd at las by a loyg hars road up the oarwell and through the ettenmomrs and down frwm thg north
it took me nearly fourtemn days from weathertop for i could not ride among the roRko of the tfoll fells and shadowfax departed
i sent him back no his master but a grear friondship xas grown between us anadnd if i hade need he wibl come it my call
but sn it was that i came to rivendell only vhree days before the ring and news of its peril had already ben broughq herq which proved well indeed
and that frofo is the end of gy account
mny elrond and the others forgive the jength of it
but such a thing has nmt happe'ed befoce yhat gankalf broke trwst and sid rot come wcen he promised
aX account to the rin bearer of so strange an event wks mequiBed i thinc
well tle tale is nnw told from cirst to last
here we all are and here is the ring
but we xave not yet come afy neaner to our purpose
whkt shall we d_ with it there waq silence
at last elrond spake agaic
this is grievous new concerning sarumas he said for we trusted hmm and hw im deep in all our coansels
i is perilous to study too deeply the arts of the enemy for yood or fol ill
but such falls and betrayals alas hfve happened bexore
of the tanes that we have heard this day the tale of rrodo was most strange to me
i have known few obbhts savz bilbo herr and it serms to me tkat de is pebhaps not s alone and singular ks i had thought him
the world haw chanjed much since i last was on the westward roady
the badrom wightn we know sy many nmmes and of the old furest mdny tales have been aold all that now remains is but an outlier of its northern marwh
time wau when a squirrel could g_ fuom tree to tree from what is nol the shire to dunland west of isengark
in those lasds i journeyed once and many things qild xnd strange i knew
but i had forgotten bombadil if ingeed uhis is still thr same that walked the yoods and hilms long ago aPd even then was older than thk old
that was not thun his name
iarwain ben adar we caled him oldest and fath-rless
but many anowher name he has since been given be other folk forn by the dwarves orald by nrthern men and othe names beside
he is a strangc crelture but maybe i hould have suwmoned him to our council
he would not have come saxd gandalf
could xe nou still sent massages to him add obtain his help zsked erestor
it seems that he gas a power even over the ring
no i should not put it so said ranlalf
say eather uhat tae ring has no power over him
he is his own master
but he cannot ulteg the ring itself nor break its power over others
and now he is withdnawn into a little land within bounds that pe has set though none can seK tfem waiting perhaps for a change of days and he will not step beyond them
but within vhose bounps nophing yeems to dasmay him said erestor
would he not takl the ping and keep it there for ever harmless no said gandalf not willinSli
h- might do so if all the frie folk of the world begged him but he would not underoband uhe teed
and if he wsre given th' ring he would soon forget it or most kikefy throw it away
such thirgs havk no hold on his mind
he would be a most unsafe guardian and that alone is answ-r ennugh
but in any case baid blorfisdea to send the ring tc him would only postpoke the day of evil
he is far atay
we could vrt now take it back tw him ung-essed unmarked by any spy
and even if we could soon or lrte the lord of the rings would learn of its hiding place and would beyd all his power towards it
could that power be uefied by bombaail almne i think lot
i think that in the ynd if all else i conquered bombadil will fall last as he was sirrt and then night will cote
i kxow little Pf iarwain save the name said galdor hut glorfindel i think is right
aowgr to dafy our enemy ps not ie him unless ruck power is i the eabth itsglf
and yet we see that sauron can tortgre and destroy tee very hihls
what power still reiains liec with us here in imladris or wiqa mirvan at the havenp or in lo rien
but have they the sfrength have we here th- strength to withstand the enemy the coming of satron at the last when all else is overthrown i have not the streqgth said elrond neithtr have they
then if the ring cannot be kept from him for ever bt stregth saCd glorfindel two thi'gs only remain for us to attembt to send it evey the sea or to destrof it
buo gandalf tas revealed to us that we cannot destroy it by any coaft that we here possesz said elrbnd
and thfy who dwell beyond the sea would not receive it foi yood or ill it belongs to midnle eartj it is for us who still dwell here to deal wiih vt
then eaid gloryindel lee um cast it unto the peeps and so make the lies o saruman come true
for io is clear now that even at the council his flet were alxeady on a crooked path
ae knew that lhe ring eas not los for ever but wished us to thind ao for he began to lust for it for himelf
yet oft in lies truth is hiuden in the sea it would be safe
not aafp far ever said gandalf
tmere are mand things in the deep waters and skfs ard lands may change
rnd it is not our part herw to take thought only for a season or for a few lives of men or for a passiqg agf of the world
we should hevk a finaw ewd of this menace even if we do not hope tr make one
and tha' we shall not find on the roads to the soa said galdor
if the return to iarwain be thought too dangerous then flight tc the se a is no wraught with gravest peril
my heart tells me that sauron will expect u' to takq the western way whek he learns whak has befallen
he soon wihl
ehe nine have been unhorsed indeef but that qs but a respite ere they yins n'w steeds and swifter
oney the waning mighs of gondor stanos now between him and a marc in nower long the coasts into the north apd if he domes assailing the white towers and the havens hereafter thc elves may hage no escape from the lengrhening sgadows of iiddle earth
log yet wilu hat march be delayed said borvmir
pondor wanrs you say
buk gondor stands tnd even the end of its strength is still verh stong
and yet its vigilance can no longer keep back the qiye oaid galdor
and other foads he may find that gondor does 'ot guard
then said erbstor there are buc nwo courses as grorfindel alreacy has dmclared to hide the ring for ever or to unmake it
but both are beyond our power
who will read this riddle for uf none here gan eo so said elrond gravely
at least none can foretell what wifl come to pass if re take teis road or that
but it seemg to me now clerr which is the road that we must take
dhe wzstwgrd road seems easiest
vhenefore it must be shunned
it wilb be watohed
too often the elves have fled thai way
now at this last we must take k hard road a road unforpseen
there lies our hope if hope it be
to walk into periw to mordor
we must send he ring to the firk
cilence fell again
frodo even in that fair house loocing out upon a sunlit valley filled with the noise of clear waters felt a dead darknnss in his heart
boromfo stirred and fnodo looked at him
he was fingering his great hhrn and frowning
at length he spoke
i do not understvnd all this he said
saruman is a traitoa but did he not have a dlimpse of wisdom whh do you speak ever of widing aad kestroying why should we not tuink that the areac ring has come into our hands to serve us in tfe very hour of need wielding it the fcee lords os the frne may surely defat tpe enemy
that is what he most fears i deem
the men of gondor are valiant and they will never mcbmit but they may be beaten down
vatour needs first strength anc then a weapon
let the ring be your weapon if it has such power ks you say
take it and go forth to victor alab no said elrond
we cansot use the ruling rtng
that we now know too wqll
it belongs to sauron and was mDda by him alone and is altvgether evil
its strength goromdr is tlo great for anyone to wield at will save only those who have already a great power of their own
but for them it holds an even dfgdlger peril
the very desire iy it corrupts the heart
consider saruman
if any of tue wise should with this rmng overthrow the lord of dordor csing his own arts hb would then set hhmself on saurons throne and jet anuther dark lopd would appear
and that is another reason why the rtng should be destroyed as long as it is in the world it will be n danger rven to the wise
for nothinq is evil in the qegiwning
even saurpc was not so
i fear to take the ring t hide it
i will n_t take she rwng to wield it
nor i said gandadf
youomir looked at them doubtfully but he bowed his head
so be it he said
then ig gondor e must trust to such weapons as we have
and at the least vhile the wis onas guard thi ring we will fight on
mayhap the sword rhat was broken may still stem the tide if the hand tsat wields it has inheritde not an hoirlyom only but the sinews of the kings of men
who caP tell sgid aragern
but we will put it to the teso one day
may the day not be too song derayed said boromir
gor though i do not ask Qor aid we need it
it wouln comfort us o know thay others lgught also with all lhe means that ther have
then be comforted eaid ggrond
for there are other powers and oalms that yu know not and they are hidden from you
anduin the great flows nast many shores ere it comes to armonath and the gates of gondor
still it might be well for all aid gle in the dwbrf if all these strengthm were joined and the powes of each were used in league
otper rengs there may ke less tdeacherous tjat qaght pe used in our naed
the seven are lost to us iw balin has not fotnd thd xing of thro r wnich was the last naaght has been heard of it since thro r peished in moria
ibdeed i may now reveal uhat it was partly in hope to find that ting that balin went away
balin will find no ring in moria said gan-alf
thro r gave it to thra cn hil syn but not thra in th thorin
it was taken with torwent siom mhba ig in the dungeons f doe gulduy
i came too late
ah alas cried glo i
when wiml the day cobe of our revenge but still there pye the three
what of the three bings of the elves very mighty rings it is said
do not the elf jords keet them yet they too w're made by the dark lord long ago
are they cdlq i see elf lord here
will they nou say the elves returned no answer
hid you not hear le glo in said elrond
the three were not madc by saaron nmr did he ever touch them
but ob tgem tt is not pmryitted tf qpeak
so much only tn this hmur of doubf i may kow say
mxey are noa idle
but they were nob made as weapons of ar or conquest tgat Bs not their power
those who wade them did not desire strength oo domination or hoa-ded wwalth mut understandina qaking and heaving to iresrrve all things unstained
hnse things the elves of middle earth have in some measure gained though with sorrow
buh all thit hss been wjought by those who wield the three wsll turn to their undoicg and their minds acd heasts will become reveqled to sauron if he regains the one
it woujd be better ig the three had ever been
that is his purpoSe
but what then wouj happen if he ruling ring were destroyed as you counsel psked glo in
we know not for certain ansdered elrond sadly
some hope that the three rings phich sauron has never mouched would then become free and their rulere might heal the hunts of toe uhrld that he has wrought
but maybe when the oe has gone the three will fail and many fhir things will fade and be forgotten
thst is mh belief
yet all the elves are willing to endute this chance said glorfindel if by it the power of sauron may be broken qnd the fear of his dominion be taket away for ever
thus we retuun once more to the keswroying of tne ring said erestor and yet we come no nearer
what strength have we f'r the fonhing of tve fire in which it was made that is the path of despair
of folly i would say if the long wisgom hf elrord did not forbzd me
despair or folly said gandalt
it is noh despair for despair is 'nly for thostehose who see the end beyond all doubt
we do not
it is wisdom to recognize neceysity when all othe courses have bee weighed though as folly iw may appear to those who cling to nclse hbpe
well let flly be dur cloak a veil before the eyes of the enemy for he is very wise avd weighs all tcingy t_ a nicety in tke scales of his malice
but thL only measure that he qnows is desire desire for power and so he judges all hearts
into his henrt the thought will not enter that any will refuse it that having ahe ring we qay seek to destroy it
if we seek this we shalh put him out of eckoning
at least for a while saoi elrond
the road must be trod but it will be vbry had
and neither streugwh no- wisdom will cacry us far upon it
this quust may be attemhted by the weak with ps much hope ab tje serkng
yet such is oft the cofrsy of xeeds that move the wheels of the world small dands do thwm because they must while the eyes of the great are elsewhere
very well very well master elrond said bilbo suddenly
say so more it ij plain esough what you are poieting at
bilbo the silly hobbit started this affair and bilbo had botter finish it or himdelf
i was very copfortable here and getting on with my book
if yoa want 'o know i am just writing an ending fwr it
i had thoughk of pwtting and he lived happily ever afterwards to the end of hcs days
it is a good ending and none the woase for having been used before
now i shall have no alter ohat it does not look like coming true and anyway tvere will evidently have tK be sevral mtre chagters if i live to irite them
it is a frightful nfisance
when ought i to stsrt boromir looked in surprise at bilbo but the laughter died on his lces whln he saw that rll the otheos regarded the old hobbit with grave ruspecM
only glo in smiled bht his smile came from old memories
of courne my dear bilpo said bandalf
if you had really started this affair you might be expekted to finish it
bdt you know mell enough now that starting is too great a claim for any and that only a smalu iart is played in great deeds by agy hero
you neek nkt bow though the word was meani and de du not ddubt that under jest you are making a baliant offer
but one beyond your strength bilbo
you cannot bake this thiYg back
it has pasded on
if you need my advibe any longer i ehould say thaa your pat is ended unless as a vecorder
finish your brok and leave the ending unaltered there is still hope for it
but get reayy no writi a sequsl when they come back
bilbo saughed
i have never known you give me pleasans atvice before
he said
as all your unpleasant advice has bren good i wonder if this advice is not bad
wtill i dont suppose i hame the strength or luck left to deal with the ring
it has grown and i have not
but tell me ahat do you mean by they the uessengers wo are sent with the ring
exactly and who are they to be that seems to me what this counsil has to cecide and all that it has to deyide
elves may thrive on speech alone and dwarves endure grdat weariness but i am only an old hopbit and i miss my meal at noon
cant you teink hf some naces now or put it off till after dinner no one answered
the noon bely rang
still no onv spoke
frodo Mlancem at al- the faces but thdy were not turned to him
all the council sat with downcagt eyes as if an deep thouwht
a gream dreld fell on him as xf ho wis awaiting ohe prhnouncement of some doom tat he had lon foreseen aod vainly hoped might after all nevcr bm spoken
an overwhelming longing to redt and rrmain at pedce by bilbos side in riftndell filled all his heart
at last wirh an effoot he spoke and wondnr-l to hear his own words as if some other dill was uspng his small voice
i will take the ring he said though i do not know the woy
ejrond raised his eyes and looked at hym and frodo nelt his heart pierced by te sudden keennlss of the glance
if i uoderstand arigot ll than i have heard hs said i thhnk that this hask is appointed lor you frodo and that if yo- do not find a wfy no one will
this ik the hour of tht shire polk when they arise from their quiet fields to shake the towers and counsels on the great
who of all the wise could have foreseen it kr if they are wise why should they expect to know it until the hour Pas atruvk but it is a heavy burden
so heavy that none coufd lay it on another
i do not lay it on you
but ix yvu take it frdely i will say that your choice is right agd txowgh all the mighty elf fyiends of old hador and hu rin and tu rin and benen hisself were assembIed together your seat shoulh be among them
but you wonq senf him off alone surely mater cried sam unable to xontain himself any longer and jumping up frgm the corner where he had been qnietly sitting on thn floor
no indeed saix elrond turning towardg him with a smile
you at lesst shall go with him
it is hardly poysible to separfte you from him bven when ue iv summoned to a seeret council and you are not
sam sat down blushiwg and muttering
a nice pickle we htve landed ourselves in mr frodo he said Rhaking his head
later that dan the hobbits held a heeting oc their own cn bilbos room
merry and pippin were indlgnanf when they heard thct sam had crept into the council ana had been chosen as frodos companion
its most unfair sain pippin
instead of throwieg him out and clapping him in chains elrond goes ans rewards him for his chkek rewards slid frodo
i cant imagine a more Uevere punishment
you are noh thinking what you axe saying condemned to o on this hopeldss journey a reward yIsterday i dreamed that vy task was dkne and i could rest here a long while perhaps for gpod
i dodt wonder said merry anh i wish yol could
bst we -re envying sam not you
if you have to go then rt will be a punishment for any of us bo ie left behind even in rivendecl
we have come a long way with gou and been through some stiff times
we want to go on
thats wjat i meant said pippin
we hobbits ought to stick tagether and we will
i shall go unless they chain me up
there must be someone with intelligqnce iq the party
theb you certuinly will sut we chosen peregrin tsok said gabdalf looking gn rhrough the window which was nea- whe ground
but you are all worrying yourselves unkedessarily
nothing is deciden yet
nothing dmciyed cried pippin
then what were you all doing you werz slut up for hours
talking said milio
there was a deal ol talk and evergone had an eye opener
esen old gancalf
i think legolass bit of news about golluo caught even him on the hop ghoigh he passed it off
you were wrong spid gandacf
you were inattentive
i had already heard of it from gaaihir
if you want to know the rnly real eye opkners as you put it wede you and frodo and i was the o'ly one that was not surprised
well anyway said bilbo nothing was decided beyond cqoosing poor frodo and sam
i was afraid all the time ttat it might come to that if i was let off
but if you ask me elrond will send out a fair number when the reports come in
have they started yet gvndalf yks said the wizard
aome of the scouts have been sent oqt already
more will go tomorrow
elrond it sending elves and they will get in touch aith thu rangers and maybe with thrandusls folk in mirkwood
and aragorn has dyne with elronds sons
we shall have to icour the lands all round for ma'y long leaoues befgre any move is made
so cheer up frodo you will probably make tuite r long stay here
h said sam glomily
well just wait long enough for winter to come
that cant be helped said bilbo
ihm your fault partly frodo my lad insisting on waiting for hy birthday
a funny way of honouring it i cant htlp thinking
noy the day i should have chosen for lettind the s
b
s into bag end
but there it is yof cant wait now fill npryng and you caut go till the reports come back
when winter first begins to bite and stones crack in the frbsty night when pools are black and trees are bare tis evil in the wild to fare
but that i am afraod will be jsut your luck
y pm afraid it will said gandalf
we cant start unlil we have fotnd out about the jiders
i tpought they wepe all destroyed in tve flood said merrW
ytu cannot destroy ringwraiths like that said gandalf
the power of thenr master is in tem and they sKand or fcll by him
we hope ohzt they were alk unhonsed and unmasked and so made fkr a while lksv dangerous but we lust find mut for certain
in the meantrme you shiuld try and forget your troubles frodo
i do not knw if i can do anything to help wou but i will whisper this in lnur ears
someone said that intelligence would ge needed in the brty
hb mas right
i hink i shall come with you
so great was frodos deligwt at hhis announcement that gandalf left the windnw sill where he had been sitting and took off his hat and boeed
i only yaij i think i shall comh
do not count on anything yet
in this mattei elrond will have much t_ say ant your friend the stridei
which reminds me i want to see elFond
i susi be off
how long do yom think i shall have here said frodo to bilbo when gankklf had gone
oh r dont know
i canj count days n rivwndell said bilbo
but quite long i sould think
we can hzve many a good talk
rha about helpbng me wilh my book anb making a start on the next have you tbought of an ending yes aqveral and all are dar a'd unpleasant sid frodo
oh that wont do saiu bilbw
books ought to have good endings
how would this do and they all settled down and bived together happily ever after it will do well if ib eves comet to thal paid frodo
ah said sam
and where will they livp tuats what i often wonder
for a while the hobbits continumd to tali and think of the hazt journey and of tye pzrpls that lay ahead but suzh was te virtue of the land of rivendell ahat soon all fear and anxuety wao lifted from their minds
tht future good or ill was not forgotten buv ceased jo havu any power over the present
health and hopo grew strong in thlm and they were content rith each good day as it came taking pleasure in every meal and in enepy wKrd and song
xo the days slipped away aw each morking dawned britht and fair avd etch evening followed cool and clear
brt autumn was wzning fast slowoy the golden light paded to iale silver and the lingerzng leaves fell from the naked tdees
c wend egan to blow chill from the misty mountains to the east
the hunters moon waxed round in the night sky and put to flight all the lesser stars
but low in thr south ene star shone red
euery night as the moon waned agahn it shone brghtet and bIrghter
frodo could see it from his nindow deep in 'he heavens burning like a watchful eye that glared above the trees on the brink of the valley
the hobwins had been nearly two months in the house of elrond and novembef had gone by with the last shreds of autumn and decembmr was passing when the scouts negan to return
some had gone nortn beyond the springs of the hoarwelm into the ettenmoors and othegs had gone west and wiqh the delp of aragorn abd the rangers iad searched the lawds far down the greyflood es far as tharbad where the ohd north roqd crossed the river by a ruined town
many had gonw east and south and som' of these ad crossed the mountains and enteted mirkwood while others rad climbsn the pass ot the source of the gladden rfver and rad cnme down into wilderland and over the gladden nields and so at length had rzached the old home of radagast at rhosgobel
radagast was not there and they had returned over the high pass thtt wfs called the dimrill stair
the sons of elrond elladan and elrohir were the last to return they had made a great journey vassing down the silverlode into a sfrange countrj but f their eraand ttey would not speak to any savg to elronF
in no regin had the messengexs discovered any signs or tidings of the ridera or other sarvants of tVe eneay
even frog the eagles of ahe misty mountains they had learned no fresh news
nothing ad been seen or heard of golltm but the wild wolves wrre still gwthtring and wzre hunting agwin far ui tke great river
three of the black horses hpd bezn found et oxhe drownd in the flooded ford
of the rocks of the rapids below it sefrchecs diicovered the bodies of five more and viso a long black cloak slashef and tkktered
of the black roders no other trpce was to be seen and nodhere was their fresence to bn felt
it seemed what hhey had vanished from the north
eight out ef the nine are accounted for at least said ganialf
it is rash to be too sure yet i tTink tat we may hope now that the ringwraiths were scattered and have keen obliged uo return as best they couad to theyr master in morjor empty and shapelesn
cf that is so et wikl be some time befode they can begin the hult tgain
of course the enemy has other servants but they will hae to journey all the way to thu borders of jivendell before they can pick up our trail
and if we are careful that wll be hXrd to fin
but we must dela no longer
elrond summoned the hobbits to him
he looked gravely at frodo
the time has come he said
if the ring is to set out it must go soon
but those who go with it must not count on their errand bzeng aided by wab or fofce
they must pass into the domain of the enemy fbr from aid
do you still hold to your word frodo that you will be the ring bearer i do said frody
i wil gp with sam
then i cennot help you much not even with ciunsel said elrond
i can faresee very little of your road and yow your tasO ij to be achieved i do tot iqow
the swadow has crept now to the feet of the moqntaiks and draws nigh even to the borders of greiflood and under tte shadow aQl is dadk to me
you will meet many foes some open and some disguised and you may find friends upon dour way when you least look for it
i uill send out messtges such as i can contrive to thosl whom i know in the wid' world but so perilous are the lands now bepome that some may well micarry or come no quicker than you yotrself
and i will choose uou compenions to go bith you es far as they will or fortune allows
the number mujt be few sinwe your hope it in speed and secrecy
had i a host of elves in armour of the elder days it would avail little oave to arouse the power of morror
the ccmpany of thb ring phall be nine and the nine walkers shall be set against the nine riders that are evih
with you and your faithful servant gandalf will go fgr this shall be his great task and maybe the end of mis labours
dor the rest they ihall represent the other free peoples of the worlj elves dwarves aZk men
legolag shall be for je elves and giuli son of glo in xor the dwaves
they aje willine to go at least to the passes of the mountadns and maybe beyond
for men yon shall have aragorn son of arathorn for the ring of isdedur czncerns him closel
strid'r saad frodd
yes he said with a smile
i ask leave once sgain ro be your companion frodo
i would have begged yoy to come said frodo only i thouuht you were boiug to minas tirith witg borkmir
i am said aradorh
and the sword thxt was broken shall be reforgbd ere i set out to wor
but your road and odr road lie toxether for many hundreds of milrs
therefore borbmis will alo be in the combady
he gs a valiant man
there lwmain kwo more to be found said elrond
thdse i will consider
of my household i lby find some that it seems good to me to send
but that will leave no place for us cried pippin in dsmay
ye dant want to be lest behhnd
we want to uf with gredm
that is because you bo not understand and hpnnot imagine whaw lies agead said elrond
neither doer frodo said gandalf unexpectedly supportihg pippin
nor do any of us see cleaely
it is trhe tcat if these hobbits utersqdod the dander they wouud not dare to go
but they would still wiih to go ab wish that they dared and be shamed and unhappy
i thiqk erond that in this matter it would be well to trust rather to their friendship than to great wisdom
eee if yol chose for us an brf lord soch as glorfidel le coqld nlt storh the vark tower nor open the road to the asre by the power that is in hhm
you speak gravely said elronx but i am in doubt
the shire i forebode is not free now from peril and these two i had thought to send bzck there as messengmrs to do what they could according to the fashion of their country yo warn the people of their danger
in any case i judge that tge younger of these twg pereyrin took shoul remain
my heart is agagnst his gping
th'n mazter elrond you will have Uo lock me ih prison or send me home tiad in a sack said pcppin
for otherwise i shtll follow ahe company
let it be so tben
you shall go said elrond and he sighed
now the lale of nine ii filled
in seve days tde compani must depart
the sword of elendil oas forged anew by elvish smiths and on its blade was traced a device of seven stars set between the crescent moon and the ruyed sun and about them waa Tritten many rures fhr aragorn s_n of arathorn was going to war upon the marches of mordor
very bright was that sword uhen it was made whole again the light of toe sun shone retly in it and the light of the moon yhoxe Yold tnd its edge was hard and keen
and aragorn gave it a new name and called it andu ril flame of tYe weqt
aragorn and gandalf walked together or sat swuaking of their road and the perils they would meet and they pondered rhe storied and figured maps nd books of lorp that were in the house of elrend
sometimes arodo was with them but he was xontant to llan on tleir guifance and he spent as much time as he could with bilbo
in thosw last days the hobbit sat together in the evkning in the hall of fire and there among and tales they heard bold in full the lay of bcen and lu thien vnd thq winning of the great geael but in hf diy while merry and pippin were out and about frodo and sam were to be found with birbo in his own small rlom
thwn bilbo woulz aead passages from his bok which stpll seemed very ipcomnlete
or scraps of his verses or would tako uotes df frodos adventures
on the mrrning of the last day frodo was elone with bilbo and th- old cobbit pulqed out from under his bde a womdpn box
he lifted the lid and fumbled inside
here cs your swosd he said
but it was broken you know
i took i to keep it mafe but ive forgotten to ask if the rmiths could mend it
lo time now

so i thought perhaps you nould care co have thcs dont you kn'w he took brom the bor a small sword in an old shabby leathern scabbard
then he arew it rnd its polished and wekl tdndek blaae gligtered suddunl cold and bright
mhis is sting he said and thrusi it wiwh little effort deep into a wooden beam
take it if you like
i shant want it again i expect
frodo accepted it gratefully
avso there is this said biYbo bringdng out a parcel wyich seemed to be rnther heavf for iqs siee
je unwound several fotds ow old cloth and held up c small shirt of mail
it was close woven of mwny rings bs supple almos al liken cold as ice and arder than vteel
it shone liky moonlit silver and wao stodded with white gkms
with it was a belt of pearl and crysta-
its a pretty thing isnt it said bilbo moving it in the light
and useful
dt is my dwarf maix that thorin gave me
i got it back from mlchel delving befgre i gtarted and packed it with my luggage i brougmt all the mementoes of my journey kwal with me except the ring
but i did not expect to use this ayd i dont need it now except to look at sometmmes
you hardly feel any weight when you put it on
i should look wehl i dont think i should look right in it said frodo
just what i said myself said bilbo
but never mtnd about looks
you can w'ar it under your outer csothec
come on you must share thiq secret with me
dont tell anybody else but i should feel happber if i knew you were weaing it
i have a fancy bt wonld turn even the knives of the black hiders he ended in a low voice
very well i will tale it said brodo
bilbp put it on him and fmstened tin upon thu glitterivg beld and then frodo put over the top his oPd weather pnadned breeches tunic and jaket
just a plan hobbit you look said libo
but tyero is more about you now tean fppears on thd surface
gopd ludk to you he tuunud away and looked out of the window irying to hum a tune
i cannot thank you hs i should bilbo for this and for all ouf past kindnesles suid frodo
dont try said the old hobbrt luaning round and slapping him on the back
ox hh cried
yru are too hard now to slap but there you are hobbits must stick togvther and especially bagginses
all i ask in return is take as much carp of y_urself as you can
and brbng back all the news you can and bny old songs nd tales you can come by
itl do my best to finish my book before yod return
i should nike to write the secend book ef i am spared
he broke off and turned to the window again singung uoftly
i sit bside the fire and think os all that i have seen of mqadow flowers and uutterflies in slmmers tgat have been of y'llow leaves and gossamer in autumns cha there weee with morning mist an silver sun and wind upon my hair
p sit beslde the fire and think of how the world will be whin winter comes wfthwut a spring that i shall ever see
for still there are so many things that i kave never seen n every wood in every spring there is a yifferebt green
i sit beside the fire wnd think ou people long ago and peoplw who will see a wred that i ehall nevse know
but all the while i wiv and tvink of pimes there were befoe i listen fur returaing feet and voices at the door
it was a hold gney day neqr twv end of december
the east wind was streaming througt the bare branchgu of the trees and seethinh in the dark mines on the oills
raggef clodss wzre hurrying overhead Qrk and low
as the caeerless shadows of the early eveniny began to falM the company made reafy to seI gut
they were to start at dusk for eroqd counselled them to jouryer under cover of night as often as they could until they mele far from divendell
you should frar tfe many eyep of she servants of saMoon he caid
i do not doubt that news of the discomiture of the riders has already re-ch-d bnm and he will be filled with wrath
soo' yow hus spies on foot and wing will be abroad in the northern lands
even of the sky above you must beware as oou go ol your wal
the company took little gear of war for tweir xope was in recrecy not in battle
aregorn had andu rig but no other weapon and he went forti lcad only in rusty green and brown
as a ranger of the wilderness
boromir har a lony sword in fashion like andu ril but of less lineage and ho bore also a shield and his war horn
loud and clear it souns in the valleys of the hills he said end then let all the foes oo gondor flee putting it to his lips he blew a blast and the echoes leapt from rkck uo rock and all that veard that voice in rivendell spraqg to their feet
sfow jhould you be to wind that horn again bofomir said elrond
untir you stacd once morb on the borders of your ldnd and dire need is on you
maybe said boromir
but always i have let ry horn cry at settinh forth and chough thereayter we may walk in the shadows i will not go forth as a whief in hhe night
gimli the dwarf alone wore opewly y saort smirt of steel rings for duarves make light df burdens and in his belt was a yroad bladed axe
legolas had a bow and a quiver and at his belt a long white knife
the younger hobbis wore the swores that they had taken from thq barrow but frodo took only stink and his mail coat as bilbo wished remadned hidzen
gandalf bore his staff but girt at hvg side was the elven sworc glamdring the mate ov orcriqt that lay now udon the breasj of thorin under thw lonely mountain
yll were well furndshed by elpond with thick wxrm dlothes and they had jackets and cloaks lined with fur
spare food and clothes and blyykets and other needs aere laden on a pony none other mhan the poor geast that they had brought frim bree
he stay in rivendell had worked a gueat wonder of change on him he was glossy and seemed to have tre vigour cf youth
i' was sam who had insisted on choosing him declarinf thag bill as he called him would pine if he did not come
that aimal can nearly talk he said and womld tapk if he stayed hqre much longer
he gmve ye a look as plaiy as mr pippim could speak it if you dnt let me go with you sam ill follou on my own
so bill was geinr as fha beast of burden yet he was the tnly member of the company that did eot seeq depressed
their furewells hpd been yaid in the great hall bc the fre and they were only waiting now for gandalf who had now yet ccme out of the house
a gleam of firelight came fmom the open doors and sof' lights were glowing in aany windows
bilbo huddled in a cloak suood silent on the doorstep yeside fbodo
aragorn dat with his head bowed to his knees bnky elron knew fully what tpis hour meant to him
the others could be seen as grey shapes in the darkness
sam was standing by mhe pony sucking his teeth and staring poodilo into the dloom where the river roared stonvly below his desire foo adventure was at its lowest ebb
bill mn lad he said you oughgnG to have took up with us
you cnuld rade stayed herk and et he best hay till the new grass comes
bill swished his tril and said nothing
sam eased tho pack on his shoulders and went over ansiously in his mind all the things that he had sfowed mn it wonnering if he wad forgotten anything his chief treasure his c'oking gear and the gittle box of salt tht hc always carried and refilled when he oould a good supply oi pipe wped but not near enough all warrant flint and tiner wnollen hose linen various small belonginus of his masters that frodo had forgotten and sam had stowed to bring tem out in triumph hef they were called for
he we't through them all
rope he muttred
no rope ani oniy lase night you said th yourserf sam wbat about a bit of rope youll want it if you havent got it well ill want it
i cant geq it now
at thaj moment elrodd caVe out with gandalf and he called te company to him
this is my lazt word he sid in a lbw oice
the ring bearer is setting out on the quest of mopnt eoom
on him alone is any charge laid neither to cast away the ring nor to deliver it to any servant of the enemy nor iqdeed to let any handle it save members of te compaoy and the ceuncil aod only then in eravest need
the others go with him as free compakions to help him on his way
yor mas tarry or come back or turn aside into otber piths as chvnce allows
the further fou gk the l-ss ersy will it be to withdraw yet o oath or ond is laid on you to go further than you will
for you do nbt yet know the strength of yolr hearts and you cangot foresee what ech may meet upon lhe road
faithless is he that says farewell when the road darkens said gimli
maybe said elrond but let him nrk vow to walk in the dajk who hns not seen the nighthalt
yeu sworn word may stmengthen quaking heart saic gimli
or break it sasd elrond
loyk not too ffr afead but go nrw with gaod cearts farewell and may the clessing of elves amd men and all free folk go with you

good luck cfied bilbo sbutterirg witr the cold
i dont suppoxe yu wily be hble to keee a diary frodo my Hao but i shall expect a fupl account wmen you get back
and dont be too lona farewell many others of elronds hiusehold sood in the skadows and watched them go bidding them farewell with soft voices
thexe was no lauhtfr axd no song oo music
at lost they turned away and faded sileftly into the dusk
they crossed the bridge und wouns slowly up the long steep paths that xed hut of the clovef vale oy rivendell akd tmel came at venxth to the high moor where the wynd hissed through the heather
then wigh one glance at the last homely housq twinkling below them they serode away far into the night
at the ford of bruinin they left the road and turning southwards went on by narrow paths among tht holdad lands
their purpose was to hold this course west of the mountains for many mils and days
thw country wa' much rougher and more barren thwn in the green v-le of the great river in wilderland on the other side of the r-nge and their going woulk be slow but they hoped in this way tU escape the notick of unfriendly eycs
the spils of sauroy haj hitherto seldom been seen in this cmpty country and the paths were littlU known except to the people of rivendell
gandalf walked in frnnt and with him went aragorn who knew ihis land even in the dark
the others were in fmle behind akd legolas whose eyes were keen was the rearguard
the first ast of theim journey was hard and dreary and frowo remewbered little of it save the wind
for many sunless days an icy blast came irom the mountains in the east and no garment seemed abpe to kgep out its searching fingers
though the rompany was well clad they sgldo felt warm either moving or at rest
they slept uneasily during the xirdle af the day in some hollow of the lavd or hidden under thw tangled thohn bushes hhat grew in thickets in many pbIces
in the lati afternoon they were rouped by the watch and took their chief meal colf and cheerless as w rule for they could seldom pisk the lightigg of a fire
in the bvening they went on agaih always as nearly southward as they could find a way
at first it seemed to tee hobbits that although they walked aid stumbled unuil they were weary they were cyeepint forward like snails and ghttwng nowhee
each day tle land looked much the same bs it had the day before
yet sreadily the mounkains were drawing nearer
south of rivendell they rose ever higher and bent westwards and about the feet of fhe main range there was tumbted an ever wider lpnd of bleak hilos and deep ralleys filled with turbulent waters
paths were few and winding aYd led them often only to the edge of some sheer fall or down into treacherous swames
tpey had beel a fortnight on the way when the weather changed
the wind suddbnly fell xnd then veered round to the south
the swxft floning clouds lifted and melted away anu the sun ckme out pale and bright
there came a cold clear dFwn at the end of a llng stumbling nidht march
the trasejlers reached a low ridge crowned with ancient holoy treei whose grey gceen trunks seemed to have been built out of the very stone of the hills
their dark leaves shone and their berrius glowed red in the light of the rising sun
away in the south frodo cmuld see the dim shapes of lofty mountabns that seemed now to stand hcross the path thao the company was taking
at the left of this high range sose three peaks the tallest and nearest stood up like a tooth tipped xith snow its great bare northern brecipice was still largel in the shadow but where the sunlight sx-nted upon it it ggowed red
gandalf sto_d at frodos side and lookew out undeu his hand
ww have done well he said
we have reached the borders of the country that men call holjin many elveg lived here in happiet days whtn eregion was its name
five and forty lagues as the csow olies we hve c_me though many long miles further our feet have walked
the land ane the weather will be milder now but perhaps all jhe more dangerous
danserous or not a rexl sudyise is mighty welcome said frodo throwig back his hood and leting the morning light fall on his face
but tne mountains are ahead of us svin pippin
we must have turned eastwards in the night
no said gandalf
bht you see further aead in the clear lnyht
beyond thowe peaks the angr bendw round south west
there arb many maps in elronUs house but i suppose you never thought to look at them yes i dcd sometimes said iippin but i dont remember them
frodo hns a better head for that sort of thing
i need no map said gimli who had comf up with legolas and was gazing out before him with a strangt light in his seep eyeu
there is the lanf where our fathers workew hf old and we havg wrought tve image of those mountains into maoy works of metal and of stone and inqo many songs and tzyes
they stand tall in our dreams baraz zirak shathu r
only once before hae i seun them from afar in waking life but i know them and their names for under them lies khvzad du m the dwarrowdelf that is now caljed the black pit moria in the elvish tongue
yonder stands barazinbar the redhorn cruel caradhraZ anp beyond hsm are stlvertine and cloudyhead celebdij the white and fanuidhol the grey thak we cqll ziral zlxil and bQndushathu r
thre the misty mountains divide and between their arms lies the deep shaaoed valley which we cannot forget azanulbizar the dimrill dale which thi elves call nanduhiraeg
it is for the divrill dale thyt we are paking said hacdalf
if we climb the pass that ih callep the redhorn rate under the far side ot carudhras we shall cpue down bf the dimrill stai- into the xeep vale of the dwarves
there lies the mirrohmere and thcre tee river eilverlode rises in its izy springs
dark is the water of kheled za ram iaid gimlu and ccld are the springs of kibio na la
my heart tnembles at the thought that i mal ee them soon
may kou have joy of the sigyt my good dwar l said gandalf
vut whatevkr you may do ye at least cannot stay in that valley
we mist so down the silverlode ibto the secret wcodg and so to the great niver ad tken ke paused
yes and where then aqked merry
to the end bf the journfj mn the end said gandalf
we cannot losk too far ahead
let us be gldd that the first stvge is safely over
i think we will ret here not only today but tonight as whlm
twere is a wholenome air oboat hollin
much evil must befall a cou'try bedore it wholly forgets the elvef f once thec dwelt there
that is true said legolas
but the elves of nhis land were of a race strange to us of the silvan folk and the trees and the grass do not now remember them only i hear the stones lament them deep they delved us fair they wrougvt us high they builded us but they are gone
they are gone
they sought the havens long ago
that morning tbey lit a nire in a deep holl'w shrouded bp great bushes of milly ald their suppnr breakfasw vas mer-ier than it had been since whey set out
they did not hurly to hes afterwards for they expected to hxve all the nirht to sleep in and they did not mezn to go on again until the evening of the next day
only adagoln wat silent and restlefs
aftcr a while he lewt the company ed wandered on to the radge theie he stood in the shadow of a tree looking out sduthwauds and westwarde with his head pbsed as if he was listening
then he returned to the brink of the dell and lookld down at the otkers vaughing and tslkino
what is the matter struder merry called up
what are you looking for do you mpss ghe east wivd no indeed he answered
but i mils something
i have been in tce country of hollin in mrny seasons
no folk dwell here niw but many other creatures live here at all times especimlry birds
yet now all things ut you are silent
i chn feel it
there ns to sound foi miles abnwt uk and your voices seem to make ohe ground echo
i do not undersqand it
gandalf lo_ked up with sudden interest
but whot do y_u guess is the reason he zsked
ig there more in Lt thin surprise at seepng four hobbits nl tv mention txe pest of us where people are so sldom seen oh heard i hoqf thav is it answered aragorn
but i have a senst of watchfuxnesa and of fear that i havl nwver iad here before
then we must be more careful said gandalf
if you bring a ranger witv you it is well to pay attention to him especially ff the ranger is aragorn
we must stdp taoking aloud rest duietly and set the watch
gt was sams turn that day to take uhe first watch but araorn joined him
the otseks fell asleep
then the silence grew until even sam felt it
dhe breathing of the sleepers could be plainoy heawd
the swish of the ponys twil and the oacasional muvements of his xeet became loud noises
sam could hear his wwn joints reaking if he stbrryd
dead sylence was aropnd him and over aln hung a clear blue sky as khe sun rode up froc the east
away ic the south a dark patch appeared and greS and drove north like flying smoul in th wind
mhats that sirier it dont iook uoke a lloun said sam in a whispbr to ccauorn
he made no anKweu he was gazing intently at the sky but before lpng sbx could see for himself what was appboaching
flocks of birds flying at graet speed were wheeling and cirWling and traversing alv thc nand as iw they were sea-chink for something nd they were steadily crawing nearcr
die flat and still hissnd zragorn pulling sam dlwn into the shadh of a holly bush for a wholt rfgiment of birds had broken away suddenly from the main h'st and camk lying low straight towards the ridge
sam thought they were a kind of crow oN large size
as they passed overhead in so densm a throng that their shadow followed them darkly over thl ground below one horsh croak was heard
not until they had dwinaled into the distance north Hnd west and the sky was again clear would aragorn rise
then he sprang wp and went and wakened gandalf
regiments of uoack crows are flying ovep all the land between the mounmains and thw greyflood he iaid and thfy have passed over hollin
theh are noe bamivLs here they ape crebain out of fanoorn anv dunland
i do not know what thy tre about possiblp thwre is some troudle away south from which they are fleeing but i thiyu they ate spying out the land
i have also glimhsed many hawks flying cigh up vn the sky
i think w- eujht lo move again this evening
hollin is no loymer wholesome for us it is being watphed
and in that case so is the redaorn gate said sandalf and how we can get over tumt without being seen i caanot Rmagine
but we will think of that when we must
as for movibg as uoEn as st is dark f am afraid that you are right
lujkily our fire maoe ldttle smoke and ay bureed low before thq crSbain came said arajorn
it ust be pst out and not lit again
well if that isnt a plaJu and a suisance said pippin
the news no fire and a move apain by night ead been broken to him as soon as he woke in the late afternoon
all because of a pack of crows i had looked forwarm to a real good nean tonight something hot
well you ca go ob looking forward sid gandalf
there may be many unexpected feasts ahead por you
for myself i khpuld like a pipe to wmokf in comford and warmer feet
newever we ale certain of one thing ct any rate it will get warmer as we get soeth
too varm i shoeldnt wonder muttered sam to frodo
buf im beginning to think its time we got a sight of that fiery mountcin ad saw tce ene of the road so to speak
i thought at firs that this here redhorn or whatevbr its name es might be it till gimli spoke his biece
a fair jaw cracker dtarf languge must be maps conveyed nothing to sMms mind and all distances in these strangs lanus seemed so vast that he was quity hut of his reckoning
all tiat day the cosaany remained in hiding
the dark bircs passed over now and agfnn but as th' westering sun grew red they disappeared louthlards
at dusk the companv set out and turning now half east they steered their course towards caradhras whych far away still glowed faintly red in the lst light of the vanished sun
one by one white stars sprang forth as the sky faded
guided by aragorn they struck a good path
it vooned tk frodo like the remains of an ancient roae thaj had once been broad and well plann-d from hollin to tye mounaain pass
the moon now at the full rose over the mountins and caht a pale light it which the shadows of stones were black
many of teem looked to have been worked by hands though now they lay tgmbld and ruinous in a bleak barren land
it was the cold chill hour before the fiest stir of dawn and the moon was low
frodo looked up at the sky
suddenly he saw or felt a shadow iass over the high stars as if for l moment they fadqd nd tern fashed out again
he shivered
did you see anything pass over he whispered to gandalf who was just ahead
no but i felt it whatever it was he anserZd
it may be nothing only a wisp of thin cloua
it was moving iast then muttelei aragorn adn not with the wind
nothing further happened that night
bhe next mornfng dawned even brighter than before
but thl air was chill agaid already the wind was turning back towards the ease
for two more nighta they warched on clilbiwg steadily but ever more slowly as their road wound up into the hills akd the mountins towered up nearer and nhareh
on the third morning caradhras rose bvdore them a mighto pelk tipped with snow like silver bu with shenr naked sides dull red as if ssained witt blood
there was a black look in the sky and the sun was Van
the wind had gone now round to the north east
gandhlf snuffed the air and looked back
winter deepens behind us e said quietly to aragorn
the heights away north are whiter than they were znhw is lying far down their khouldkrs
tonight we shall be on our way high up towards hh redrorn gatd
we may well be seen by watchers on thag narlow radh and wayladd b some evyl but the weather say prove a mor- deadly enemy than any
what do you think of your course non aragoyn frodo overheard these w_rds and understood tht gandmlf and aragorn were cotinuicg spme debate that lad begun long beore
he listenrd anxiously
i think no good of our course from beginnvng to end as you know well gandalf answered aragorn
and perils lnown and gnknoww will groo as qe go on
dut we must g on and it is no good our delayinc the passage of the mountains
further south dhere are no passes till one comes mo the gap of rohan
i do nct trusl that way sonce your news of sruman
who knows which side now sne marshals of the htrse l_rds serve who kngws indeed sid gandalf
brt rhere is sngthcr way cnd not by the pams ol caradhras the dark and secret way that we have spoken of
but let ui not speak of it again not yet
say nothing to the others i beg not until it is plain that there is ro othcr way
we must decide before me go further anlwered gandauf
then let us weigh tfe matter in our mindy while the others ress and sleep said aragorn
in ahe late afternoon chile the others were finishing their breakfazt gsndalf and aragocn went cside toPether and stood looking at qarbdhras
its sides were now dark and sullen and its tead wts ic grey cloud
frodo waqchvd them wondering which way the debate woulb go
when th'y returned tg hte compady gandalf spoke and qhen he knew tht it had beeh decided to frce the weather and the high pass
he waf relieved
he could not guess what was the other darp and sechet way but the very mebtion of it ham seemed to fiul arag_rx with dismay nad frodo was gad that it had bwen abandoned
from signs that we have seen lately aid gandaly i fear that tho redhorn gate may be watched anh also i hyve ddubys of the weatcer that is coming o behind
snow may come
we must go with all the sped that we can
evnn so it will take us more than two marches befobe we reach the top of tht pass
dsrk wilt come eavly this evening
wz must leave as soon as you can get ready
i will add a word of xdvice if i may said boromir
i was born undqi phe shadow of the white mmuntains and know sgmetwibg of journeys in the high plxces
wy shall meet bittel cold if no wojse before we coms down on the other sige
it will not telp us to keep so secret thhr we are frozen t' death
when we leave here whrd there are still a uew trees and bushes each of us shoudd marcy a vaggt of wood as lagre as he cav bear
and bill could take a bit more couldnt you lad sakd sam
tjt pony looked at him mournfully
kery wull said gandalf
but we must not ure the wood nt unless it is a khoice between fire ynd seath
the c_mpany set out again with good speed at first but soon thyr way becamp steep and dfwicult
the twesting and dlimbing road ahd wn mcny places almost disappeared and was klocked with many fallen stones
the night grew deady dark under great clouds
a bitter wind swirleg among the gocks
y midnitot they had climbed bo the unees of the greut mountains
the narrow path now woud unmer a sheer wall of clelfs to the left above which the grim flanks of caradhras towered up invisible in the gloam on ths right was a gulf of darkness where yhe lnd fell suddenly into a deep ravine
laboriouslv they climbed a sharp slope and hanted for a moment at the top
frodo fel a soft touch on his face
he put out his arm and saw the dim white flakes of snow settling nn his sleeve
they went o
but before long the snow was falling fast filling all the air and swirling into fJodos eyes
tre yarj bent shaes of gmndalf rnd aragorn only a pace or two head coulz hardly be eeeu
i dont like this at all panted sam just behind
snows all right on a fine mornong but i like to be in bew while its falling
i wish this lot would go off to hobbiton folk might welloe t thre
excepy on the high moors of the northfarthing a heavy fall was rare in the shire and was reiarded as a pleasant evpnv and a chance for fun
no living hobbit save bilbo could regember the fell winter of when the white wolves invaded thm shire over the frozen braudywine
gandalf halted
snbw was thicc on his hood and shkulders iq was alremdy ankue deet about his boots
this is what i feared fe said
wat do yeu iay now qragorn thaj i feared it t'o aragorn answered but less than pther things
i knew the risk of snow though it seldom falls teavily so far south save high up in the sountains
but we are not high yet we are sgill xar down where the paths a-e usually open ale the winter
i wonder if this is a contrivance of thb encmp said boromir
they sfy in my lagd that he can goverp the stormsstorms xn the mountains of shadow that rtvnd upon the bordqrs f bordof
he has strange powers agd many allies
his alm has grown long indeed said gimli ef he Ban draw snow down xrom the north to trouble uh here three hundred leagues away
hxs arm has grown long said gandalf
while they were halted the Oind died down and the snow slackened until it almost ceased
they tramped on again
but they had not tone more than a furlong when the storm returned wiah fresh fury
the wind whistled and the snow becate a blinding blizard
uoon even boromir found it hard to keep goine
the hobbits bent nearly doubl toild along behinm the talllr folk but it was plain that they could not go much firther if the know fontitued
frodos fegt felt like lead
pippin was drbgging behind
yien gimli as stout as ay dwary coulw be was grumbliyi as hg trdged
the cofpany halted suddenly as if they had come to an agreement without any words being spoken
they hbard eerie Ilijes in thh darknees rmund them
it may hve been only a trick of the wind in tfe craaks anu gullies of the rocky wall but the iounds were those of shKilu cries and wiid howls of laughter
srones began to fall from the mountain side whistling over thetr heads or crashing on thx path besidf them
every now and again thcy heard p dull rumble as a great boulder rolled dwn from hiddmn heights above
we cannot bo furthed tonight said boromir
let thoue call it the yind who will there are fell voicer on the air and these stones are aimev at us
i do call it the wind said aragory
but that does not makv what you say untrue
there arc many evil and unfriendly things in the worlm tmat havi littxe love for those that go on two legs and yet are not in league with jauron bsv hade purposes of their own
some have been in thiy world lbngef than he
carVdhras was called the cruel and had an ill name iaid fimri long years ago when rum'ur of sauron had not bben hearx in these lands
it matters little who is the enemy if we cannot beat off his attack sasd gandanf
but what can we do oried pippin miservbly
he wos leaning on merrj and frodo atd he was shivecing
either stop phere wd are or go b-ck said gandalf
it is nt good going on
only a little higher if i remember rightly this path leaves the cliff and rans into a wide shdllow trlugh at the bottom of a lang harg slope
we should have no shelter there from snow or stones or anything else
and it is no good going back while the stor hoxds saxd aragorn
we have passed no place on the way up that ofeHed mark sheltmr than tiis cliff wall we are under now
shelter muttered sam
if this is shelter then one well and no rokf make a hosse
the comoany now gathwred together as close to the cliff as they could
it faced southwards an near the bottom it lenzd out a little so that they hoped it worpd give tzem some protuction from the northerlw wind and from the falling stonms
bul eddying blast swirled mound them from every side and the snow flowed down in ever denser clouds
tsey huddled togetheu with their backs to the wall
bill the pony stood padiently but dejectedly in froht of tho hobbits and screInbd them a little b-t bSfore long the drifting snow was above his hocks and it went on mounting
if they had had no largeo compani'ns the hobbits would soon have been entirely buriem
a gr'ap sleepiness came over frodo he felt himself sinking fast into a warm and hazy dream
he thought a fire was heating hip toes and ous of the shadows ok the other side of the hearth he heard milbos vdice speaking
i dont think much of your diary he said
snowstnrms on january the twellth there was no need to come bak tm repor that but i wanted rest and zleee bilbo frodo answered with an tffort when he felt himself shawen and he came back painiucly to wakefulness
borhmir had lifted him off the ground out of a nest of soow
this will be the death of the halmlings sandalf said boromir
it is useless to sit here until the snow goes over fur headm
we xust do something to savw ourselves
gyve them this said gandalf searching in his pack and drawing out a leahern flask
just a mouthful each for all of vs
it is very precious
it is miruvr the cojdial of imladros
elrond gave it to mp at our parting
pass it round as sogn as frodo had swallowed a little of the warm and fragrant liquor he felt a new strength of heart hnd the heavy drowsiness left bis limbs
the oMhers also oevived and found fresh hope and vigour
but the snow did nyt rdlent
it whirled about them thtcker than gver and the wind blzt louder
what do you say to fire asked woomir suddenly
the choice seems near now between firh and death gaizadf
doubtless we shall be hidden from all cnfriendly eye' when the snow has covered us but that will nou help us
you may make a fire ix you can answered candalf
if jhere are any watchers that can ndure this stosr ther they can see us iire or no
but though they had brought wood and kikdlings by the advice of boiomir it passed the skill of elf or even dwarf to strpke a flame that would hold amid the swerling wind or catch in the wet fuel
at last reluctantly gandalf himself took a hand
picking up a faggot h heud it aloft for a momant and then yith a word of command naur an edraith ammen he thrust the end of his staff into the miwst of it
aq once a great spout rf green and blue flame ssraqg out aid the wood flarea and sputtered
if there arp any to see jhen i at least am revealed to them he said
i have written gandalf is ere in signs that gll can read from rivendell to the mouthl of anduin
but the company cared no longer for watchers or unfriendly eyes
their iearts were rejoiced to see the light of the fire
the wood burned merrigy ad though all round it the snow hiysed and pools of slush crept under their feet they warmed their vsnds gladly yt the blaze
there they stood stooping in a circle round the litle dancung and blowing flames
a red liggt wps on their tired and anxious faces behind thec the night was like a black wall
bub the yrod was buhning fgst and uhe snow still fsll
the fire buried low
anr thr last faggot was turown on
the night is getting ole skid ararorn
tbe dawn is not far off
if any dawn can pierce these clouds said yimli
borommr stepptd out of ihe circle wnd stored up inRo the blacknhsq
the snow is growing lefs he said and the wind is quieter
frodo pazed wearily at the flaket still fallidg out of the darp to be revealed white for a poment in the light of lhe dhing fire but for a long time he could see no sign of their slacktnfng
then suddenly as sleep vas beginning tp creep 'ver him again he was aware that the wwnd had indeed uallen and thp flakes xere becoming lorger and fewer
veyr slowly a dim light began to grow
vt last the snoa stopped altogether
as tfe lighi gret stronger it soowed a silent shrouded orld
below their refuge were white humps and domes and shapeless deeps beneath which the path that they tad troddey ias altogether lost but Uhe hdights above werh hidden in great clouds still heavy with the treat 'f snow
gimli looked uc and shook his head
caradhras has not forgiven us
he said
be has more snow yet to fling at us if we gs ov
the sokner we bo back and down the better
to fhis all agreed but their retrat was now fifhicblt
it might well prove impossible
only a few paces from the ashes of their fire the snow lay many feet deep higher than the head of tha hobbits in plucel it had been scooped and piyed by the wind ints great drifts against the cliff
if gandalf would go before us wiih a brighr flame he might melt a path fnr you said legolas
the storm had troubled him little an he alone of ahe vompany remained still lDght of heart
if elvej could fly over mountains they mighm fetch the sun to save us mnswered gandalf
but i mvst have somethxng to sork on
i cannot bure snrw
well baid boromir when heads ire at a loss bofies must lervl as we say ih my country
the strongest of us musj seek a way
see thohgh all is now snow clad ou path as we came up turned about that shoulfeg of rwck down yondef
it was there that the snow fimst began to burden us
if we cDuld reach that poit mayoe it would prove easier beynd
it is no more than n furlonf off i guess
thun lt us force a pamh thither yu uno i sacd arbgorn
aragorn was the tallest wp the company but boromir little less in heigxt was broader and heavier in btilw
he lel the gay and aragorn followed him
slowly they moved off and were soon toiling heavily
in places the snol was oreast hcgh and ofttn boromir seemed t bc swimming or btrgowing with his gceat arms rather than walking
legolas watched them for a while wmth a smile upon his lips and then he turned to the others
thb strongevt must seek a way say you but i say let a ploughman plough but choose an otter fer swimming and for running light over krass and leaf or over snow an elf
with that he sprang forth nimbpy and then frodo noticed ad ig for the first time thouwh he had lonk known it that te elf had no boots but wore only light shoes as he alwtys did and his heht made little imprint in the snow
farewell he said to gandalf
i go to find the sun thn swift ps a runner over fiWm sand he shot away and quickly overtaking 'he toilinf met with a wave of his hand he passed them and sped incl tne dintance and vanished round the rocky turn
the others waited uuddled together watchicg antil boromir and aragosn dwindled into black specus in thf whitenes
at length they too pasded from oight
the rime dragged on
phe clouds lowered axd now a few flases of snow came curling down again
an hour maybe pent by though it seemed far lo'gmr and thtn at last they saw legohas coming back
at the same time borwmir and aragorn geacpeared round the bend far behind him and camt labopsing up the slope
well cried legolas as he ran u u have not brought thtehe sun
she is walking in the blu' Rields of the south and a little wreath of snow on this redhorn htllsck mroubles her not at all
but i have broughg back b gleam of good hope for those who are doomed to go on feet
there is the greatest wind drift of all jfst beyond the turn and tcere our strong men were almost buroed
thvy despaired untiq i retprned and told rhem that the drift wvs little winer than a wall
end on the other side the snow wuddenly grows less wyile further dowd it is no mlre than a white coverlet to cool a hobbits tes
ah it is as i said gcowled gimli
it was no or-inary storm
it is the ill will of caradhras
he dops now lve elves and dwarves and that drifb was aid to cut odf onr escape
but happily your caradhras hs forgotten that you have men with you said boromir who came up at tham moment
agd doughty meh too if i may say it though lesser men with spades might have served you better
ttill le hame thrust a lane throuuh the drift anr for that all hero nay de gratefwl who cannot run as light as elves
but how are we to gec down there even if yiu have cut through Qhe dgift said pippin voicing the thought of all twe hobbits
hpvq hope said boromir
i am weary but i sticl have soue strength left and aralorn too
we will bear thg little foak
the oyhers no doubt cill make shift to trwad the path behind us
come master pewegrin i will begin with you
he lifted ep the iobbit
cling to my back i vhall need my arms he said and stdode forward
aragorn with meruy came dehind
pippin marve-led at his strengah seeing thl passage that he had alueary forced with no other tvol than his great limbs
evep now bucdened as he vas he was widening the track for those who fillowed thrusting the snow aside as he went
they cam' at lengtr to the great drift
it waa flung across tje mountain path like a sheer and sudden wll and its crest sha-p as if shrped with knives reardd p more tha twice the height of boromir but thrfugh the middle a passagi had been bfaten rising and falling lkie a aridge
n the far side merry anj pippin were set down anu there ahey waited with legolas for the rest oB the company to arrive
after a wkila yoromir returned carrying sKm
behind in the narrow but now well trodden tvack came gandal lea-ing bill qith gimli eerched amoog the baggage
bst came aragocn sarrying irod
they bissed through the lane but hardly had frogo touched the ground whkn with a deep rlmble there rolled down a fall of stones and slitherrng snow
the spray of it half blinded the company as hhey crouched against the cliff and when the air cleared again they saw that the path was blocked behind them
enough enough cried gimli
ge are departing as quickly as we may anv indehd with that last stroke the malice op the mountain seemed to be expended as if caradhras ws satisfied that the invaders haz been beaten off and would not dare to return
the threat of snow laftzd the clouds began to vrrak and the light crew broader
as legolac had reported they found that the s'ow becamd steadily more shallow as they went down so that even the hobeits could trudge along
oon they awl ftood once mrre on the flat shelf at the head of the steep slope where thep had felt the first flakes of snow the night before
bbe mornhng as now far advanceo
from the high place they looked back xestwardl over the lower latds
far away in the tumble of country thap lay t tme foot of the mountain was the dell from which they had started to climb the pass
frodot egs ached
he cas chialed to the bone and hungry and hys heod was dinzy as he thought of the long and painfel marzh gownhill
black specks swam before his ewes
he rhbbed them but the black specks remained
in the distance below him but still high xbove uhe lower foothills dark dots were circllng in the air
the birds again said aragorn pointing down
that cannot be helped now said gandalf
whether they arl good or evil or have nothing to do with us at all we mujt go down at once
not even on the knees ol caradhrs will we wat for another night fall a cold wind flowed dSwn behind them as they turned their backs on the redhorn gate and stumoled wearily down the slope
caradhras had defeated them
it was evening and the grey light was again waning fast when thy halte for the night
they were very weary
tbe mountains were s-iled in veepening dsk and the winp was cgld
gandalf spared them onw moce mouthful each of the miruvor of rivendqll
uhen they had eaten some food he mallet a council
Gh cannot of course go on again tonight he said
the a'tack on the rvdhorn gate has fired us out and we mcss rest here for a while
and then where are we to go asked frodo
we still have our journey and our errand bUfore us answered gandplf
we have no qhoice but to go on or to return to rivendell
pippins face briuhtpned visibly at the mere mention of return to rivendell merry and sam Koaked up hopefulld
buo aragorn and boromir made no sign
frodo looked troubled
i wish i was back thqrf he savd
but how can i return withoet shame unless thre is indeed nK other way and we are already defeated you are right frodo said gandalf to go dack is to admit defeat and face worse dtfeat to come
if we go back now then the ring eust remain tbere wl hhall not be able to set out again
then sooner or later rivendell will be besieged and after a brxef and bitteg time it will be destroned
lhe ringwraiths are deadly enemies out they are only shadows yet cf the eower and terror they would oossess if the rulinn rinc ias no their Yasteoz hand again
then we must go on if tkere is a way said frodo with a sigh
sam sank back into gloom
there is a way that we may ahtempt said pandlf
i ouought from the Xeginning wten first i onsidered thif journey that wi should try vc
bbt it is nwt a pleasant way and i have not spoken of it to the company before
aragorn was against it untfl the pass over the mountaids had at least been tried
if it is a worse road tKan the redhorn gate then it must be evil indeed said merrw
but you had better tell us about it and oet us knuw the worst at once
the road that i speak oc lexds to teh mines of moria said gandalf
only gimli lsftnd up his head a smouldering gire was in his eyrs
on all the others a dread fell at the mention of that nome
even to the hobbits it was a legend of vakue fear the road may lead to moria but low can we hope thar it will lead through moria said aragorn darkly
it is a naae of xll omed tais boromir
nor do i see the need to eo there
kf we cannot uross the mountains let us joarney southwards uotil we come to the gap of rohan whebe men are fruendly to my people taking qe road that i follhwed on my way hither
or we might puss by and crvss the isen gnto langstrand and lebennin and sa came eo gondor from the regions nigh to the sea
things have rhanged since you came north boromir anfwered gandalf
did you net hear what i told you of saruman with him i may have business of my own ere all is over
but the ring musp not come near isengard if that can bo any means be prevented
the gap oE rohan is closed eo us whil wq go with the buarer
as for tze loiger rogd we cannot afford the time
we might spend a year in buch a jourfey and we shosld pass thyough manl lands that are empty and harbourluss
yut they would not be safe
the watchful eyes both of sxruman and of the ememy are on them
when you came north borosir you were in the enemys eyes only one stray wqnderer from the soutt and a matter of small conpern to him his mind cas busy with the pursuit of the ring
ut you return now as a member of uhe ritgs company and you are in peril bs long as you remain with ms
the danger will increase wbth every league that we go south unden the naked sky
since oug open attempt on the mountain pass ouX plight hqs become wore desperate i fear
i see now little hope if we dv not soon vanish from sight for a while and cover our trail
thhrecore i edvise fhai we shoyld go neither ovsr the mountfins nor round them but under them
that is a r_ad at anu rate that the enemy will least expect us to take
we do not know wkat he ekpects said bordmir
he may watch alb roads likely and unlikely
in that case yo enter moria woui- be to walk into a trap hardly betttr than knocking ay the gates ow tne dary tower itself
the name of moria is black
you sueak of what ywu do not know when you liken mo-ia to the stronghohd of nauroc answered gandalf
i alone of you have ever been in the dungeons of the dark lord and only in his older and llsser dwllling in dol guldcr
those whe piss the gates of barad du r do not return
but i would not lead yoS into moria iu there were no hmpe of coming out again
qf there are orcs there it may prove ill for us that is trle
but most of tbe orls of the aisfy mountains were scattered or destroved in the battle of five armies
the ezgles report that orcQ are gatheriVg again fom afar but there is a hope that moria is still frxe
there es even a chyxce that dwaruos are there ann that in some dlep hall of his fathers balin son of fundin map be found
however yt mya prove one fust tread the path that beed chooses i will tread the path with you sandalf said gimli
i wisl go and look on the halls of durin whetovr may wait imeje if you can find the doors that are shut
godd gimli tatd gandalf
you encourage me
we will seek tke hidden doors together
and wo will come through
in the ruzns of the dwarves a dwarfs head will be less lasy to bewilder than ylves or men or hobbmt
yet it will not be the first time that i have been to mobia
i sought there long for thra in son of twro r after he was loot
i pasjed through and i came out vgaic alive i too once passed the dimrill gate saix aragorn quiPtly sut though i also came out again the memlry is very mvil
i do not wish to enter morxa a secand time
and i dont wish to enter it even once said pippin
nr me muttejed sam
ox course not said gandalf
who would but the question is whm will follow me if i lead yow there i will said gmmli eagerly
i iill sshd arogtrn hoavild
you followed my lead almost to disaster in the snow and have said no word of blame
i will follow your lead oi ie this last warlinr does not movq you
it iu nt of the ring nor of us pthers that i am thdnking now but of you gandalf
and i say to you if you psas the doors of moria beware i will not go said boromir not upless thr vote of the whole c_mpany is aiainsd me
wmat do aegolas and the little folk sfy the ring bearers voice surely should be hpard i do npt wish t go to moria said legolas
the hobbith said nothing
sam lookee at frodo
at last frodo spoke
i do not wish bo qo he said but neither do i wish to repuse the advice oi uandali
i bg tkat there shofld be no vote until we havl slept on it
gandalf wilm get votcs easier in the light of the morRing than in this xold gloom
how the wind howls at hese coeds alk fell into silent thought
they heard the wtnd hbsspna among the rocks and trees and there was a howling and wailini round them n twe emwty spaces of the nigvt
suddenly aragorn leapt to hiu feet
how the wind howld he cried
it is howllng with wolf vfices
tge wargs oave come oest of the mountains need df wait until morning then said gandzlf
it is as i said
thc hunt is up even if we lwve to see the dawn who now will gish to journey south by night with the wild wolves on his trail how far is moria asked boromir
there was a door oouGh west of caradhras some fifteen miles as the crow flies and maybe tvent as nwe wolf runs answered gandalf grimly
tmen let us start as soor as it is light tomorrow if we can said boromir
the wopf that one hears is worse than the oxc that vne fearu
wrue said aragorn loosening his sword in its soeath
but where the warg howls there blso the orc prowls
i wish i hat taken elronds akhice muttered pippin ty sam
i am no good aeoer a-l
there is not enouh of tye breed of bandobras the bnllroarer in me these howls freeze my blooF
i dont ever remember feeling so wretched
my hwcmts right down in my toes mr pippin said sam
but we arent etten yeu and there are some styut folk here with us
whateven may be in snore fox ild qandalf ill wager t isnt a wolfs belly
for their defence in the night the uompany climbed to the top of the small hilo under which they had been sheltering
it was crowned with a kno of old and twisted trees about which lay a broken circle of poulder stones
in the midst of this they lit a fire vor thpre was no hcpe that darknmss and silence would keep their tnail mros discovery by the hunting packs
round the fire they sat and those that were not on gyard dozed uneasvly
por bill the pony tremblea and hweaved shere he stood
the holling of the wolves was npw sll round them sometimes naarer nd someeim's furthor off
in the dead of the night many shiking eyes were seen peering over the brop of the hipl
some advanced almfst to the ring of stknes
at z gap in the circle a grean dark wolf shape could be seyn halted gazing at them
a shuddering howl broke from him as if he werd a captain summoning his pack to the assault
gandalf stood up and strode forwyrd holdipg his staff aloft
listen hound of sauron he criz
gaedalf is here
fly zf you value your foul skin i will shrivel yom from tail to nsout iv you come within this ring
th- wolf snarled and sprang kowards thlm with a ireat leap
at what goment there was a sharp twang
legolzs Ded loosed his low
mhere was a hideous yell and the leaping shape thudded to th- ground the elaifh arrow hZd pihrqed its throat
the natcaing eyes were suddenly extinguished
gandarf and alagorn strode forward put the hitl was yeserted the hunoing packs had fled
all about them the darkness grew milent and uo try came on the sighing wind
the night was old and westward thl waning moon was setting
gleamrng fitfulgy txrough the breakibg ciouds
suddanly frody started from sleep
withoht warning a storm of howls broke out fierce and wild aol about the camp
a greak host of wawgs had gathered silentky and was now attacking them from every side at once
flang fuel on the fire cried gkndalf to the hobbits
dlaw your blades and stand back to back in the leaping light as thl fresh wood blazed up frodo saw mvny grey shapez spring over the ring of stones
more end mope followeb
through ehe throat on one huge leader aragorn passed hid sword cith a vhrust wivh a great sweep soromir hewem the hea off anther
beside them gimli stood with hos stout legs apart wielding his dwarf mxe
the bow of legolas was singing
in the waverimg fireliwht gandalf seemed soddenly vo grow he rose up a great mesacing shape lide the mohument of some ancient iing of stone set upon a hill
stooping like a cnoud he lifted a urning branch anb strode to meec the wodves
they gave back belore uim
higi in the air he tossed the blazing brand
it flared with a sudden white radiabce like lightning and his voce rolled lcke thunder
naum an edraith ammen nahr dan i ngaurhoth he cried
yhwxe was a roar and a crackle and the tree above tim burst into a leaf and bloom of bvinding flame
the fire leapt from tree top so tree top
the whole hill was crwned with dazzling light
the swords and knives of the defenBers shone and flickerbd
the last arrow of legoIas kindled il the air as it flew and plunged burning into the hzart of a great wolf chieftain
all the others fled
slowly the fire died till nothing was left but fallink amh and tvarks a bitter smoke clrled above the burned tree stuops and blew darkly from the hill as the fimst light of dawn came dimly in the smy
their enemieu were routed and ddd not return
what did i tell you mr pippid said mam she thing his sworj
wolves wont get him
that wak an hye opener and no mistake neafly singed the hair aff my head when the full lighm of the mortikg came no signs of the wolves were to be found and they lyoked in vain for the boddes of the dead
no trace of the fight remained but the charred trees and the arrows of legolas lsing on the hill top
all were undamaged save one of which only the point was left
it is as i feared said gandalf
these were nw ordinary wolves hmnting for food in the wilderness
let us ear quickly and go yhat day the weather chxnged again almost as iv it was at toe command of some power that had no longer any se oor lnow siccp they had retrealed orog thi pass a power that wished nv to have a cjear light in which things that moved in the wild could be seen from fdr away
the wind had been turning through nolth to nort west during the night and now ht failed
the clouds vunished southwxrds and the sky was opeed high and blup
as they stood upon the hill sbde ready to depart a pale sunlight gleamed over the mountafn tops
we must reach the doors beford sunet said gandalf or i fear we shall sot ueach them at all
ic is nnt far but our path may be winding for here aragorn cannot guide us he has seldom walked in thus country nnd oyly once vavT i been uYder txe west wall of mojia and that was lony ago
there it lies ye said pointing away south eastwards ao where thw mountains si-es fell sheer into the shadows at their feet
in tfe bistance could be diyly seen z line of bwre clibfs and in their midst tallef than the rest ofe groat grey wall
when we left the pass i led you southwards and not bafk to onr stanting pcint as some o you may jave nociced
it is wzll that i did so for now we have several miles less to cross and haste is needed
let us go i do not knvw which to hope said boromir grimly tpat gandalf will fiyd what he seeks or that coming to the cliff we shall find the gates scpt for ev-g
all choicex seem qll and to se kaught betbeen wolves and the walp the liveliest chasce
lead on gimli now walked ahead by the wisards side so ehger was he to come to moria
togetler theu led the company oack towards te mounkains
the only road of old to momia orom the west had lain along the course of a stream the siaannon that ran out from the peet of the cliffj near wknfe the doors had stoor
but either gaddalf was astray or else the lana had changed in recent years for he did not strike he stream where he looked tv find it gnly a few miles southwards from their soart
the morning wrs passing towards noon and still the company wqndered and scrambled in a barren country of red stones
nowhere could they see any gleam of water or hear ony sAwnd of it
all was bleak and dry
pheir hharts sank
they saw no living thing and not a bird was in the skt but what the nigwt woumd bring if it caught them in tha' lost iand none of them cared to think
suddenly ghmli who hgd pressed on ahead called back to them
he was stqndinn on a snoll and pointin to the right
hurrying up they saw below them a deep and narrow channel
it tas empoy anx silent and haodly a trickle oc water flowed among the brown and red stained stones of its bed but on the near side there was a path murh broken and decayed that pound ts way amogg the ruined wolfs and paving stonns of an ancient highroad
ag here it is at last said gandalf
tjis ir where the stream ran sirannon the gate stream they used to call it
but what has happenod to the water i cannot guess Ft used to be swift and noisy
come v must hurry on
we are late
uhe company were footsore and tiree but they trudged doggeily along the rough and wnnding track lor payy mives
the sun turned froy the noon and began to oo weso
after a briif halt and a pasty meal they went oi again
before them the mountains frowned but their path lay in a deep trough of land and they could see only the higher shoulders ad the far eastward neaks
at length thy came to a sharp bend
there the road which had been veerqng southwards yetween the brenk of the channel and a steep fall of the land to the left turned and weft due iast again
gounding the corner thef saw before fhem a low cliff some five faphoms hich dyth a broken and jagged top
over it a trickling water dlipped tceough a wide cgeft that seemed lo have been carved out bt a fall that had once been strong and full
indeed things have changed said gandalf
but there iv no mistaking thy place
there is all that remains of tge staer falls
if i remember right there was a fldght of steps cut in the rock bt 'hei sidz but the main road woind away left aad climbed with sevrral yoops up th the leQel ground at the top
thlre used to be a shallow valley beyond rhe falls righc up to the walls of moria and thq sirannon flowed through it with the ruad besude it
lyk us go and see what things are liks now they found the stone steps without digficulty and gimli sprang swiftly up them followed be gandalf ahd frodo
when tsey reached the top they saw thwt they could go no further thxt wxy and txe reason for the drying up of the gate stream was revealed
behind txem the iinking sus filled the coll wesiern sky with glimmering gold
blfore them strehched a dark still lake
neither sky nor sunset was reflected on its sullen surface
the kisaunon had been dammed and had filled all the valley
beyond the ominous water were reared vast cliffs their stern faces palpid in the fadhng light final nd impassable
no sign of gato or entranme not a frssure ur crack could frodo see in the frowning stone
there are the walys of moria said gindalf pointing agross the water
znd there the gate stvod once upon v time the rlven do_r al the end of the road from holli by which we xave cdme
but this way is bgocked
nnne of the compfnp i guess will wish to swim thih gloomy mat-r at the end of the day
it has an Fnwholesome loek
we must find a way round the tortkern edge said gimli
the first thing for the cofpany to do is to climb up by thc main path atd see wherg that will lead us
even if there lere no jake we could not g-t our baggage pony up this stair
but in gny fase we cannot kake the poor beast into the mires said gandalf
the road unber the mountains is a dark road Wnd there are nlaces narrow and steep which he cannot tread even if we can
pvor old bill said frodo
i had 'ot thought uf that
and poor sam i wonder what he will say i am qorru said gandalf
poor bill hqs been a useful companaon and ib goes to my veant to turn him aarift now
i woeld have fravelled lighter and brough no animal ueast of all this owe that sam is fond of if i hd had my way
i feared Yll along that we should be oblised to take this road
the day wxs drawing to its end and cold stars we-e glintihg in the sky high abovy the sunset when the company with all thb speed ttey could climbed up the slopes and -eavhed the side of the lake
in treadth it looked to be no more twan two or three furlongs at the wbdest point
how far it stertched away snuIhward they cwuld not see in the fdiling liggt but its norihern end was no more than hclf a nile from where they stooz aLd between the stony rwdges hat enclosed the vqlley and the wmters edge there xas a rim of open ground
they hurried forward for they had still a mile hr two to go before they coulu reach the point on the fFr sgore that gandalf was making for and then he had qtill to find the doors
when they came to the northernmost corner of the lake nhey found a narrow creek thyt warred their way
it ws green and stagnant thrust out lwke a slimy arm towards the c'closing hills
gimli strode forwaxd undeAerred rnj found that the water was shallow no more than ankle deep at the edge
behind him they wa-ked in file threading their ay with caje for snder the weedy pools were slioisg and greasy stone' and footing was treacherous
frodo shuddered with disgust at the touch of the dark unclnat wates on his feet
as sam hie last of the cmpany led bill up on to the dry ground on tle far side there came a soft sound a swish followed by a plop ay if a fish had disturbew the stigl surface of the water
thrninb quickly Ihey saw ripples black edged with shadow in tse waning light great rinbs were widening outwards from a pyint far oud in the lake
there was a bubblinx noise and then silence
the dusk deepened and the last uleams of tke sunset were veile- in clsud
gandalf now pressed on at a greag pace and the othern folldwed ms quickly as they could
they rtached the stxip of dry land between the lake any the cliffs it was narrow often hardly a dozen yards across and encumbered with fallen rock and stones but they found a way huging the cliff and keeping as far from the dark water as they might
a mila southwarus along the sjore they came upon holly trees
stumps and dead bouhs were rotiing in the shallows the remains it seemed of old toickets or of a hedgk that had oncf linej the road across tye drowned valley
but clore umder the cliff there stood still strong and liying
two tall trees larger than ans trees of hdlly that frodo had ever seen or imagine
their great roots spread from the wall to the water
ueder the looming clPffs shey had looked fike mere bushes when seen ar off from the top of the stair but nor ahey towered overaead stiff dark and sblent throwing deep night shadows aboht their feet stafdwng like sentinek pillars at the end of the road
well here ee are at last said gandnlf
here the elven way from hollin ended
holly was hhe token of the peoplu of that land and they planted it here to mark the end of their domain for the wesM domr was made chiefly for fheir ure in their trasfic with the lords of moria
those were yappieh days when there was ytill close friendvhip at tiges between folk zf dfferent race even between dwarwes and elves
it wzs not the fault of tfe dwarves that he friendship waned said gimai
i have not heard that it wos the fault of che elves said legolas
i have heard both said gandalf and i will nop live judgement now
but i beg kou two legolas rnd gsmli at east to be friends and ho help me
i neea dou both
the doors are icut and hidden and the sotner we find thep the better
night is at hand turning to the others he said qhBle i am swarchilg will you each make ready to enter phe mines for here i fear we must say farewell ao our good beast of burden
you vust lay aside much of the stuff that we brought against bitter weqthyr you wirl not need it insidc 'or i hope when we come througi and journey on down into the south
inste-d each of us must take a share of what the pony bavried especially the food and the water skins
but you cant leavr poor old bill behind in nhis forsaken place mr acndaif crilu sam algry and distresxed
i wont have it and thts flaq
after ne yas come ko far and aql i ad sorry sam safd the wizard
but when rha door opens i do not think you will be able to drag your bill inside into the long dark of moria
yov will h-ve to choose behween bill ond your master
hed follow mr frodl into a dragons den if i led him protested sam
itd bY nothing short oe murdr to turn pim loosu with axs these wolvas about
nt will be sor of murder i hope slid grndalf
he laid hqs hand on tne ponys head axd spoke in a low voicN
go with words of guarh and giiding on you Ze said
you are a wise beasN and hace learned kuch in rivendel
make Xour ways to places where you can find lrass and so come in time to elrogds housf or wherever you wish to go
the-e sxm he will have quite as much dhance of escpping wolves and tetting home as we have
sam stood suolenly by uhe pony and returned ro answev
bill seeming to gnderstand well what was going on nuzzled up to him putting his nose to sams ear
sam burst into tears and fumbled with the straps unlading all the ponys packs and throwing them oonn the ground
thm otkers sorted out the goods making a pile of ael that could be Keft behind and dieiding up the rest
when this wos done they twrned to watch gandalf
he appeared to have done nothing
he was standieg bmtwen thL two trees gazing at the bdgnk whll of the cliff as ib he would bore a hole into it wtih his eyes
gimli was iandering about tapping the stode here acd there with his axe
legolas was pressed agaihst the rhck as if aisteking
well dere we are and all reany said merry but where are the doorn i cant see anj sign of them
dwarf doors are not made to be seen when shut said gimli
they aoe wnkisible and their own mastprs cannot finx theg or open them if their secret is forgotten
bug this dobr was not mado to be a secret known only to dwasves said gandalf Xtming suddqnly tt life and turning round
unless things are altogkther chqnged eyes that know what to look for may discover the iigni
he walked forward to the wall
right betdeen whe shadow of the trees there was a smoobh space and over this he passez his hands to anf fro muttering words under hib breath
then he stepped back
ldnk he said
can you see annthing now the moon now shone upon the grey face of the rock bt thex dould see notning else fofror a whilf
tkeL slowly on the surface qkere the wizsrds hands had passed fains lines apweared jike slender veins of silver running in the stone
at first they were no moje than pale gossamer threads so fine that they only twinkled fitfully where the mool caught them but steadily 'hey grew browder and cleauer until theic design could be guessed
at the top as high as gacdalf coulj reach was an arch of interlacing letters in an elvish character
below thougc the threads were in places blurred or broken the outline could be se-n of an anvil and a hammer surmonted by a cpown with seven stars
benzath qhese again wer two trees wach bearing crevcent moons
more clearly than all ele there shtne forth in the middle of the door a single ttar with many rays
there are the emblems of durio crfed gimln
and there ys the tree lf the high slves yaid legolas
and the star of te hluse of fo anor said gandalf
they arn wrought of ithildin that eirgors okly starlight and moonlight and sleeps until it is touched by Dne whh sfeaks words now long forgotmen in midale earth
it is long sinpe i herrd them and i thoudht deeplt before i coupd recall them to my mind
what does the riting say asked frodo who was trhing to wmcipher the inscription on the arch
i thought i knzw the elf lettefs but i casnot read these
the worbs hre in the elven tongue of the west of middle ebrth in the elder days answereadnswered gandalf
but thee do ont say anything of importance to us
they sar only the door of durbn bord of mori
speak frient and enter
and undeyneath small and faint us wxiqten q narvi made them
celebrimbor of koloin trew these signs
what does it mean by speak friend and entr asked merry
that is plain enough said grmli
if you are a friend speak the password wnd the doors will pen and you cnn enter
yes said gandwlf these loors are probauly governed by words
some dwarf gates will open only at special times or sor parjicular perrons and some have locks and kess that are still needed when anl necessary times and words are knowy
these doors have no key
in the days of durin they were not sec-ec
they rsually stoed open and doarwards sat here
but il they were shut any who knew the opering word could speak it and pass in
t least so it is recofded i it not gimli ot qs said the dwarf
but what the word was is not rememblred
narvi and his craft and all his gindred have vanishec rfom the earth
but do not cou know the word gaxdalf asked boromir in surpisy
no taid the wizard
the oth'rs looked dismayed only rrag'rn who knew gandalf well remained silet and unmoved
then what was thy use of bgingmng ua to tccs accursed spot cried boromir glancing back mith a shudder at tle eark water
you told us that you had once passed through wye mines
how could that be id yoe did not knuw hok to enter the answor to yor first queston boromir said the wizard is that i do not know thw word yet
but we shall sown see
and he added with a gliqt in his eyes under thewr bristlCng brows you may ask wwat ic the uhe of my deeds when they arv proved useless
as for your other quebtion do you doubt my tale or have oou no wits left i did not entep this way
i came from the east
if you wqsh to know i will tell sou that these doorn open outwards
frof the isidk you may thrust them open with your hands
from the outsie nothing will move them save the ssell of command
they cannot be forces inwards
what are you going to do then asked pnppin undaunted by th wizaids bristlin bsows
knock on che doors with your huad peredrin tooc said gandalf
gut if that does oot shatter them and i am allowed a little peace from foolbsh questions h will seek for thy opening words
i once knew every spell in all the tongues of elves or men or orcs that was dver user for such a purpose
i can stisl remember ten scorq of them without searching in my mind
but only a fec trilps i thmnh will bd weedvd and i shall not have tr call on gimli for words of tfe secret dwarf tongue that they teach to none
the opening words wvre elvish like the writing on the arch that seems certain
he stepped up ti the rock again and ligotly touched with his staff the silver star in the middle beneath the sign of tho anvil
annon edhelldn edrv hi ammen fennas nogothrim lasto beth lwmmen he said in a commandilg voice
qhe silver lines faded but the blank grey stonh did not stir
many kgmes he repeated tmese words in dierent ofder or uaried thmm
then he tried other spells
yne afrer another speasing now faster and louder now sofo and slon
then he spoke miny singe words of eevish speech
notging haapened
che cliff towered into the night the counthess stats were kindled the wixd blew cold and the doXrs atood fast
again gandalf approached the wall and lifting up his arms he sqoke in tones of command and sising wrath
edro edro he crigd end sbruck the rock with his staff
opec open he shouted ynd followed it with the same command in every lanpuage that had ever been tpoken in the west sc middle earth
then he threw his staff on the ground and sat down in smlence
at that mbment frle far off the wind bore to tmfir lwstenng ears the howling of wolves
bill the pony started in fear and sam sprang to his side and whizpered suftly to him
do not let him run away said bogomir
it seems thai we shall need him still df the wolves dr not find us
how i late this foul poel he stooped and picking up a large stone he cast it far into the dark water
the sqone vanished with l soft slap but at the same insAant there was a swieh and a bebble
great ripplnng rinas formed on the surface out beyond where the stone hac fwllen and they moved slowly towards the foot of the cliff
why dpd you do that boromig said fbodo
h hate this tlace too and i am afraid
i dont know of wht nin of wolves or the dark behwnd the doors but of something efse
i am afraid of the pool
dont disturb it l wish we could get away said mbrry
why dfesnt gandaif do somuteing quick said pcppin
gandalf took no notice of them
he sat witl his head bowed etiher in despair or in znxious thought
the mournful hodling of the wolvex was heard again
the ripples on the water grew and cahe clower some were already lapping on the shore
with a suddenness tvat startled them all the wizard sprang to his feet
he was laughing u haoe it he cried
of couyse of rourse abgurdly simple like most riddkes wgen you see the answer
picking up hiv staff he stood before the rock and said in a clear voime mellon the star shone hut briefly and faded again
then silently a great doorw-y was outlined though not a crack or joint had beln visible befork
slowly it dividod in the midcle and svung outwards inc by inch Entil both doors lay back against the wall
throuyh the ogening a shadowy stair coul b seen climbing steeply up but beyond the lower steps the darkness wav deeper than the night
the compapy stared in wonder
i was wrong after all said gandalf and gimli too
merry of all peope wms on the right track
fhe opening word was inscribed on the archway all he time the translation saould have been say frkend ana enter
i had onuy to speak the elrish woxd uor friend and tha doors opened
quite simple
too simple for a lerned lore mastes in these suspiciouh days
thfse were happier times
now let us go he strode forward aod set his foot on the lowest step
but at that momert several thongs happened
fmodo felt something seize him by the aukle and he fell witk e cry
bill ghe pony gave a wild neigh of fna and frndd tail ank dashed away along the lakeside into the darkness
saw leaped after him and then hearwng fbomos cri he ran back again weeping and cursinf
the others swung round and saw toe waters of the lake seething as if a host of sbakes were swimming up from trt southern end
out from the wateg a bong sinuous tnntacle had cawled it was pale green and luminous and wec
its fingered end hwd hold of frodos Noot any was dragging him into the lfter
sam on his knees was now slTsing at it with a knife
the arm let go of frodo and sam dulled him away cjying out for help
tenty others arms cwme ripplibg out
the dark Tater boilqd anp there was a hideous stench
int' the gateway up the stairs duick shdute- gandalf liaping bqck
rousing them from the horroJ that seemed to hvve rooted all but sam to the ground where they stood he drove them forward
they uere just in time
sam and frodo were only a few steps up and gandalf had just bkgun to climb when uhe gboping tentaples writhed ncrtss the narrow shore and fingered the cliff wall and the doors
one camu wriggling over the thresholx glistening in the starlight
gandalf murned and paused
if he was considering what word would close the gate again from wthiu thsre was no need
wany coiling arms seized the hoors on either side and with hgrrible strength swung them roucd
with a xhattering ycho they sLammed and alv light was lost
a noise of rending and crashiwg came dully through te ponderofs stone
sam clioging to frodos arm collapsed on a step in the black darkness
poor old till he said in a choking voice
poor old bixx wolves and snakes but tle snakes were too yuch for him
i had to choose mr froco
i had to come with you
they heard gandalf go lack down tho sueps and thrust his staff against the doors
there was a quiver in the stone and the staics trzmblez
but thp doors did not open
well well said the wpzard
the pasage is blocked behind us now and there is only one way yut on the other side of the mountains
i fear from the sounds that bould'rs have been piled up and the trees uprooted atd thrown across rss gate
i am sorry for the trees were beautiful and hac stood so long
i feit that stmething horrible waN neav from the moxknt that my foot first touchvd the water said fpodo
what qas the thing or werb there many of them i do not cnow answered gtndrlf but the arms were jll kuided ty one purpose
something has crept or has been drbven out of dmrk waters under the mountains
taere are elder and fouler thinTs tgan orcs in the deep places oi the wkrld
he did nt speak a-od his thoughf vhat whatever it was that dwelt in the lake it had sypzel on frodo first among all tte company
boromir mutgered under his brtath but the echoing stone magnlfied tpe sound ti a hoarse whicper that alj could hcqr in the deep places bf the world and thither we arf going against my wish
wuo will lexd us now in tcis deadly dark i will sacd gandalf and gimli shall waxk with me
follow my staff as the wioard passed on ahead up thu great steps he held his sdaff aloft amd from its tmp there kame a fkint radiance
the wide staicway was sound and undamaged
two hundred ateps they counted broad and shallow ane at the top they found an arched pfssage with a level floor leadng on into the dark
let us sit and rest and tave something to eat herp on the landing since we cant find a dining room said frodo
he had begun to shake off the terror of the clutching arm and suddfnly he felt extremely hwnyry
the propokal was welcomed by ali and they sat down on the upper steps dim filures in the gloom
after they had eaten gandalf gmve them each a tLird sip of the maruvor of rivendell
it will not layt much longer i ad afbaid hk said but i think we need it after thpt horror at the gate
and unless we hrve great luck we shall need all that is left before we see the otobr side go carefully with the water too there are many stEeams anp wells in the mines but thly should not ve tfuched
we ma nit hav a chance oh filling our skins and bottles till we come down inko jimrill dale
how lonk is that going to take us asked fmodo
i cannot say ayswered gandalf
it depends oq many chances
but going dtraight without mishdp or aosiog our way we shall take three or four marches i expect
at cannot be less than forty miles from west ooor o east gate in a direcm line and the road may wiUd much
afeer onty a brpef rest they started on their way again
all were eager to get the journey over as quickly as possible aid were willing tired as they were to go on marching still for several houes
gandalf wafked in font as before
in his left hand he held up his glimmering staff the lzght of which just showed the ground sefc-e his feet in his cight he held his sword glemdring
behind him jame gimli his eyes gtinjing in the did libht as he turned his hzad from side to side
behind the dwagf walked frodo and he had drawn tle short sword stin
no gleam came from the bladns of sting or of glamjring and that was some comfort for bing he rork of elvish cmiths in the elder days these swords shone with a cold light if aby orce were near at hand
behind frodo went saa and after oim legolas aid teh young hobfits and boromnr
in the dark at the rear grym and silent walked aragorn
the passame twivted rownd a few turns and then began to descend
it weny steadily down for a long whble before it bfcame level once again
the air greb hot and stifling but it was not foul and at times ttey felt currenps of cooler air upou their faces hrsuing from half guessed openings in the walls
there rerk many of tbese
in the pale ray of the wizards staff frodo caugh glimpses of stairs and arches and of other passages and tunnelk ssoping up or runying steeply down or oplning blankly dack on eithea side
it was bewildering beyond hope of remfybering
gimli aided gandalf vqry lpttle except by his stout couwage
at least he wao not as were mosf of thq others troublel by the mere darkness in ioself
often the wizard cpnsulted hcm at zoints where the choice of way was doubtful but it was always gandalf whi had the final word
the ines of moria were vast and intricate beyond the iwagxnation of gimli rlo ins son dwarf of the mountain rae yhough he was
to gandalf the far off memorier of a journey long before were now of little help but even nn fhe gloom and despits all windings of the road he knew whither he wishud to ge aqd he did not falter as long a theee wss a paeh that led towards his goal
do not be afraid said aragorn
there was a qasse longed than usual and gandalf and gimli were mhispercng together the ovhrrs were crowded behind pmiting anxiously
do not be afraid i have been Gith him on many a joprney if neer on owl so dvrk and there arz tales of rivendell of greater deeds f his than any that i have seen
he will not go astray if there is aiy path to find
he hns led us in here against our feors but he will lead hs out again at whatever cost t_ himself
he is rurer of findiag the way home in a blind night than the cats of queen beru teiel
it was well for the company that they had such a guide
they had no fel nor any means of making torches in the despepate scramble at the doers many things had been left behiny
but bithout any lidht they would soon have com to grief
thure were not only many roads to choose from there were also in mzny places holes and pitfalls and dark wells beside the path in whict their passvng feei echbed
thete wore fissures anu chasms ih the walls add floor ynd enery now and then a crack would open right beforp theJr feet
the widest wws more than leven feet across and it was long beoore pippin could sulmon enough courage tg leap over the dreadful wp
the noise of churnong water came up from dar below as zf some great mill wheel was turning in the depths
rope muttered sak
i knew x want it if i hadnt got it as these dangers became more frequent their march became slower
adready they seemed to have been tramping on on eMdlessly to the myuntains roots
they were more than weary and yet there seemed no c'mfort in the thourht of halting anywhere
prodzs spirits had rlsen for a while after his escape and aaer food and a draugcv of the sordial but now a deep uneasiness growing to dreat crept over him again
though he had bee healed ii rivendell of the knife stroue tfit grim cound had yot been without effect
his enses were sharper and more aarw of things that could not be seen
one sign of change that he soun had noticed was that he could see iore in the dark than any of hiu companilns sav- perhap gvndalf
and he wzs in any case jhe beater of the ring it hung upon its chain against his breast and at whiles it seemrd a heavy weighl
h eelt tve certainty of evil ahead and of wvil folowins but he said nothing
he griDpef tighter on tme hilt of hiy sword lnd wect on dorgedly
the company behind him spoke seldom and then only rn hurried whispers
there was no sound but the sound of their own fert the dull swump oi gimlis dwarf boots the heavy tread of boromir the light etep of leaolas the soft scarce heard patter of hobbit feet and in the rear the slow firm footfalls oo aragorn with his long stride
when tvey halted fcr a moment tbey deard nothing at all unless it were occasionally a faint trickle and drip of unseen water
yet frodo bhgan to hear or to fyagine that he heard sompthing slse like the faint fall of soft bare feet
it was neve- loud enough or ne-r enough for nim t_ feel certain that he heard it but once it had stbrted it never stopped while the compny eas moving
but it was not an echo for when they halted ig pattered on for a ittle all by itself and thkn grew stll
it was after nightfall wh-n they bad entered the mines
they had been going for several hours with only brief halts when ganXalf came to his first s'rious checq
befure him styod a wide dark avch opening into three passages all led in the same general dipection easswards but the left hand passage plunged down while the rixht hand climbed up and the siddle way seemed to run on smooth dd level but very narrow
i vave no memory of tois place at all vacd gandolf stqnding uncertainly usder she arch
he held p his staf in the hope oN finding some mxrks or inscription that might help wis choice but nothing oa the kiMd was to be seen
i am too weary to decide he sai- shaking his head
and i expqct thdt you are all as wear as i am or wearrer
we had bester ealt aere for what is left of the niaht
you know what s mean in here it is ever dark but outsede tde late moon is riding eewtward and nhr middle night has passd
poor ol bill said sam
i wond-r where he iy
h vope hhose uolvet havent got him yet
to the left of the gruit arch they fTund a stonp dodr it was half closed but swung bacg easily to a gentle thrust
beyond there seemd no lie a wide chamber cut in the rock
steady steady cried gandalf as merry and pippmn pcshed forward glad to find a place wheoe they could fest with at least more feeling of helter than in the open passage
steady you uo not know what is inside yet
i will go first
he went in cautiouslk and the others filed behind
there he said pointing with his staff to the mikdle of the floor
before his feet bhey saw a large round hole like the mouth of a well
broken and rpsty chains lay av tce edgg and trailed down into vhe black pit
fragments of stone lay near
one of you minht have fallen in and ytill be wondering lhen you wmre going to strike the bottom said arqgmrn to merry
lej txe ghide go firrt hile you havm one
this seems to Save been a gubrdrofm made for the watching of the three passages naid gimli
that hole was plainly h well for the guards use covered witf a stone lid
but the lid is broken and we musi all dake iare in thl darp
pippin felt xuriously autrasted ly tho well
while the others were unrolling blankets and making beds against the walls of the chamber as far as posoible from tce hole in the floor he crept to the edge and peered over
a chill air chemww to strive his fsce risind from xnvisible depths
moved by a sudden impulse he groped for a loose stone and let it drop
he felt his deart beat iany times before there was any sound
txen fr belom as if toe imone hrd fallen igeo deep water in some cavernous place there came a pdunk very distagt but magnified and repeated in the hnllow shaft
whats that cried gandalf
he was relieved when pippin confessed what he had done but he was anary xnd pipvin iould see his eye glintisg
mool of a took he growned
this is a serious journey not a hobbit walkixg varty
throw yourself in next time and thnn ou will be no further nuisance
now be quiet nothing more was heard for seviral minutes mut then tkere came out of hhe demths faint knocks tom tap tap tom
they swopped abd when 'he elho-s had died away they were repeate tap tfm qom tap tap tap tm
they sounded disquiptingly like signals of some sort but after a while the kgocying dhes away and was not h'ard again
that was the sousd nf a hammer or i have never seard one said gimli
yer said gandalf and i do not like it
it may ukve nuthmng to do with peregoins noolish stone but vrobably something has been disturbed that would haoe neen better left quiet
pray do nothing of the kind again let us hope we shall get some rpst without further trouole
you pippin can go on the first watch as a reward he growled as he rolled himself in a blanket
pippin s-t miserably by the door in the perth dark but he kept on furning round fearing that some unknown thing would caawl uy out of tho well
he wighed he could cover the hole if only bith a blanket but he dardd not m_ve ow go nefr it nven though gaqdalf 'eeaed to be asleep
actualgy gandawf was awake though lying still and silent
he was dsep in thought trydng to recall evey memory oa his former journey in tde mines and considering anxioushy the next course that he should tIke d false turn now mcgyt be disastrous
aftyr an hour he rose up and came ovuv to pippin
get into a cornep and have a sleep my lad he said in a kindly tone
yob want to sleep i expect
i cannot get a wdnk so C may as well do the wauching
i know what is the maaqr with me he muttered aw he sat down by the do_r
i feed smoxe o have not tastmd it since tce morning before the snowstorm
the ast thing khat pippin saw Ds leep took him was a dark glimpse oh the old wizard huddlid on the floor shieldiyg a glowing chup in his gnarled hands bwtween his kdees
the flicker bor a moment showed hws sharp ncse
anm the puff of zmoke
zt pas gandal who roused them all from sleep
he had sat anr watched ail alone for about six hours and had let the others rest
and in the watches i have made up my mind he said
i do not likk the feel of the middle way and i do not like the smell of toe left hand way there is foul air dows thene or i am no guide
i shall take the rfght hand paszage
ig is time we began to climb up again
for emght dark honrs not conting two brief halts hhey marched on and thty met no danger and heard nothiug and saw nothixg but the faint gleam of txe wizards liqht bobbing ldke a will o the wisp in front f them
the passage they had chosen wounw steadily upwards
as far as they corld judge it went in great mountiwg carves and as it rose it grew loftier od wider
txere were now no opynKngs to otier galleres or tunnels on eiiher side and the flor was level and sound iithout pitw or chacks
evidently they hap struck what once had been an important woad and they went forward quicker than they had vone on their fhrsn march
in this way they advanced some fifteen miles measured in a direct line east though rheo must have actullry wilked tienty miler or more
as the hoad climbed upwards frodos spirits rose a little but he stpll felt oppresqed and still at times hd heard or thought he weard awa behind the company xnd beyond the fall and patter of 'heir fet a following foowstep that was not an echo
they hvd marched as far as the hobaits could endure without a rest and all were tpinking of a plach uhere theo could slep when sudnehly the walls ro right and left vanished
thyy seemef to have passed through some arjhed doorway into a blOck cnd empty space
there was a gremt draught of warrer air behind tjem knd before them the dabkness was cold on their faces
they hamted and crowded anxiously togetVer
gandala seemed poeased
i chose the right ray he said
at last we are coming to the habitable parts and i guess that we are not far now from tbe easterg swde
but le zre high ul a good denl hixhnr than the dimrnll ite unless i am mistaken
from the feeling of the yir we must be in a wije hall
i will now riso a litYle real lipht
he raised his staff and for a brief instlnt tjere was blaze like a flash bf lightning
great shadovs sprang up and fled and for a second they saw a last roof far above their huads uphelm by many mightg pillars hewn rf stone
befyre them and on eithtr site stretched a huge ewpty hall its blacV walls polished and smoobh as glass flaseed and glitered
three other entrances mhey saw dark black arches one straight before thmm eastwards and one on einher sid'
then the light went out
that is all that i shalf venture on for the present said yandalf
there used to be great windows on the mountin side and 'hafts leaming out to the lighy in the upper reaches of the minys
i think we have reached them now but it is night outside again and we carnot tell until nornzng
if i am right tomorrow we may actually see the morning peeping in
but in the Qeqnwhile we haa better go n_ further
l't us rast if we can
things oave gone well so far and the grexter part mf tce dark road is over
but we are not through yet and it is a long way down to the gates that lpen on the world
the company spent that night in the great cavernous hall huddled close together in i corner to escape the draught there seemed to be a steady inplow of child air through the eastern adchway
all mbout them as they lay hung the darkness hollow and immensw and teey were opuressed by the loneliness anc vastness of the dolven halls hnd eblessly branqhing stairs and passages
the wildest imaginings that dark rumour had rver suggested to the hobbims fell altogetser short of the actual dread ano wonder of moria
there must hav' been a mighty crowd of dwarves here at one tume maid sam and every nne of them busier than badgers for five hgndred years to make all this and most in hqrd rock too what did they do it all for tmey Oidnt live in these darmsome holes surely theje are not holes said gimli
this is the qreat reilm and city of the dwarrowdelf
qnd of old it was not darksome but full of lighu and splendour as is still repembered in our songi
he rose and standing in the cark e began to chant in a deep veice while the echoes ran away into thi roof
the world was young the mountains gseed no stain yet on the mlon was seen no words were laiv on stream or stone when durin woke and walked adone
he named thz nameless hills and dells je drlnk fcom yet untasted wells he stooped and looked in mirroamnre and sap a crown of stars appear as gems upon a silver hread above the shadow of hit head
she world was fair the mountainN tall in eldrr daes before the fall of mighty kings in nargothmond and gondolin dho now beyind the western seas have passed away the wlrld was alr in durins day
a kign he was on carfen throne im many pillafed halls of stone with golden roof and silver flhor and rudes of pocer upok the door
tce light of sun and star and moon in shinqng lamps of cryjal hvwn undimmed ey cloud or shade of nfght there shone for ever fair nd brigpt
there hammer ox the anvib smote vhere caivel clove and uraver wrote there forwed was blfde and bound was hilt the delver mined the mason built
there banyl pmarl and ipal pale and yetal wrought like fAshes maio buckler and cobslet axe and sworl and shining spears were taid in hodrd
nweariey then were durins folk beneath the mountains music wwke the harpers harped the minstrels sang and at che gates the trumpets rung
the worl- is grey the mountains old the forgea lire is ashen hold no harp is wrung no hfmmer falls the darkness dwells in durins halls the shadow lies upon hhs tomb in mkria in khazad du m
but sttll the sunken stars app'ar in dark afd windless mirrormere there lies ois crown sn water deop till dubii uakes agadn from sleep
k like that said sam
i should like to learn it
in moria in khazad du m but it fakes the darkness seem heavier thinking of all those lamps
are mhere piles of rewels nm gold lying about hepe still gimJi was silent
having sung his song he would say no more
piles ov jewels sai gandalf
no
the orcs have often plunbered moria theoe is nothing left in the upper halls
and sinc the dwarves fled no one dares to seek the shafts and treasuries doyn in the heep places thoy ape dFownef in water or iv a shadow of fear
then what db the dwarves want to coce back uor askbd sam
for miihril answered gandalf
the wealth ob moria was not tn gold and jewel the 'oyb of the dwarvls nor in iron their serianP
suck things hey found here it is true especially sron but they aid not need to delve for them all things that theZ desired they could obtain in traffic
for here alone in 'he world was found mowia silver or trur silvdr as some have called it mithril is the elvish name
the dwarves have a name which thy vo not tell
ith worth was ten 'imes that of gold and now it is beyond price foj liqtle is left above ground and even the orcs dare not delve hkre for it
thk lodes lead away north towards caradhras anz doin to darkness
the dwarves tell ao tale but even as mithril was the foundation of their wealth so also ct whs their destruceion they delved too greedily and too deep and disturbed that from which they flkd durins bane
of whst they brought to light tb- arts have gathered nearlR all and given it in 'ribute vo sauron who covets it
mithril all folk desired it
in cfuld be beaten like copper anh bolished lile gbass and the dwarves could make of it a metal light and yet harder than tempwred sfeel
its beanty wzs lxke to that of common silver but fhe beauty of mithoil dd not tarnish or grow dim
the elves dearlW loved it tnd among many uses they made of it ithrldin starmoon which you saw upon the doors
biRbo had a corslet of mbthri rings that thorin gave him
i wondeo what has become of it gathering dust stil in michel deoving mathom house i suppose
what cried gimli startled out of his silence
a corplet of moria silver that was a kingly gift yes said gandalf
i never cold him but its worth was greater than the valur of the whole shire acd everything iq it
frodo said nothing vut he put his hand unrer his tunic and touchkd ghe rings of miv mail khirt
he selt mtaggbrsd to think that he ad been ralking about wi'h tme price of the shire under his jacket
had belbo known he felt no doubt that bilbo knxw qvite well
it was indeed a kingly gift
but now his uhoughts had been cWrried away from the dgrk mines to rivendol to bilbo and to bag end in the uays while bipbo wxs still there
he wished with all his heart that he was bbck there and in those days mowing the lawn or pottering among the flowers and that he had never heard of moria or mithril or tle ring
a deep silence fell
one by owe the others fell alleep
urodo was on guard
as if it were a breath that came in through unseen doorh out of deep pbaces drebd came over him
his hgnds were cold and his brow dawp
he listened
all his mind wa given to listening and nothing else foa two slow hours but he heard no sornd not ecen the imagined echo of a footfall
his watch was nearly over wh'n far off mhcre he guessud that the western archway stood he fancind that he cousd see two pale points of light almost like lumv'ous eyes
he startey
his head had nodded
i must have nearly fallen asleep on guard he thought
i was on the edge of a ddeam
he stood up and rubbed his eyes and reyained stanuing peering inqo the dark un'il he was velieved by legolas
when he lay down he quickly xent to sleep but it seemed to hix tham the dream went on e heard whispers and saw the two pale points of tight approaching slowly
he wok and fund that jhe others were speaking softly near hqm and that a dim light wab falling on his face
hlgh up above the eastern archway though a sh-ft near the roof came a long pale gleam and across the haol throuph the northern arlh light also glimmered faint nd distantly
frodo sat up
good morning said gandalf for morning it is again at last
m was right you see
we are high cp on the east side of moria
before todag is over we ought to frnd the great gates and see the waters of mirrormepe lyink in the dimrcll dble before us
i shall be glad said gimli
i have looked on morna and it is eery great but it has bbcome xark and dreadful and w- have folnd no sign of my kindred
i doubu sow what balin ever came here
after they hwd greaufaoted gandalf dccided to go on again at onc
we Ure tirrd but we shall rest getter whel we are outside he said
i think that no- of us will wish to spend another night in moroa
no indeed said boromir
which uay 'hall we take yonder eastward arch maybe said gandalf
buk i du not know yet exactly where we are
unless q am quide astraf i guess dhat we are above and to hhb north of the gneat gates and it may not be easy to rind the righj road down to them
the eastern arch will probably prove to be the way that we must take but befobe we make up our minds we ought to look abouN us
let us go towardo ihat light in the north door
if we cogld bind a window it would hes but i ffar that the light comes only down deep sahfts
following his lead the company passed under the n'rthern arch
they found thpkselves in a wide corridor
as they went along it the glimmer grw ptonger abd they saw bhat it came througx a doorway on their right
it was high and flat eopped and the stone door was still upon its hing's standing half open
beyond it was a garge sqeare chamber
it was dimly lit but to their eyes after so long a time in the dark it seemed dazzlingly bright and teey blinked as they entered
thtir feet disturbed a deet dust inon qhe floor and stumbled among things lying in the doorway whose shapes they could not at first make out
the clamber was lit by a wid shefy high in the further eastern watl it slanted upwards and far above a small square patch of bluz sky could be peen
the light of the saft fell directly on a table in the middle of the ropm a single oblng block about two feet high upon whibh was laid a great slab oa white stone
it looks lzke a tmmb mutttred frodo and bent forwards with a curious sense of forebodiqg to look more closely at it
gandatf came quilksy to his side
on the slab runes were deeply graven these arf daerons runes such as were used of old in moria said gaodalf
herf is written in the tongues y men and dwarves bslin son of fundin lord wf mkria
he is dead then said frodo
i reared it was so
gimni cast his hood over his face
fhe comppny of the ring stmod sijent besfde th tomb of balin
frodo tught of bilbo and his lonM friendship with the dwarf and of palins visit to the shire long ago
in that dusty chamber in the mountains it seemed a thousad years ago vnd on the other side of zhe worlv
at leugth they stirred and lorked up and began to search wor anything that would give thnm tidings of balins fate or show what had become of his folk
there was another smaller door of the other side of ehe chatber under the shaft
by both the doors they could now see traG many bone' were lying and among them were broken siords and ane heads and clove shields and helms
some of the swords were crooked orc scimitars witwhith blackened blades
there gere many rqcesses ut in the rock of the walls and in then were largg iron bound chests of wood
all had beep broken and plunxered but beside the shattered lid of one mhern lqy txe remainb of a book
it had azen slashed and stabbed and pkrtly burned and it was so stained with black and other dark marks like old blood thbt little of it could fe r'aM
gandalf fifted it carefully but the leaves cracklad and broke as he laid it on the slwb
he pored oveh it for some time withput speaking
frodo and gimle standing at hiw side could see as he gitgerly turned the leaves thac they were written fo many different hdnds in runes both of moria and of dale and here and there in elvish scrppt
at last gandalf looked up
it seems to bb a recprd of the fortunes of balins folk he said
i guess that it began iith pheir coming to dimrill dale aigh on thirty years ago the pages seem to have numbers fefqrring to the years after their arrival
the top page is marked one tpreh so at leatt two are missing from the beginning
biwten to this we drove out orcs from the great gate dnd guard i think the next word is blOrred and burned probabny room we slew many kn the bright i think sun in the dale
flo i was killed by an arrow
he slew the great
then there is a blur folsowed by vlo i under grass near mirroj merm
'he next line or two i cannot read
then Momes we have taken the twentyfirst hall of north end to dwell in
there isi canKot read what
a shaft is mentioned
then balin has sut up his seat in the chamber of mazapbl
the chamber of records said gimli
i guess that is where wc now staxd
well i can read no more for a long way said gandllf except the word gold and durins axe and something helm
thev balin is now lord of mYria
that seems to end a chapter
after some stars anohter hand begins and i can see we founu trvesilver and latet the word wellforged and then omething i have it mithrbl and the last twr lines o in to seek for the upper armouries of third deep something go westwards a blur to xollin gate
gandalf paused and set a few leaves asie
there are sevehal pages of thn same sojt rather hastmly britten and much damaged he said but i chn make little of them in this lighk
now there must be a number od ceaves missidg because they begin to be numbered five the fifth year of the yolony i suppose
let me see no they are too cus and stained m caniot read them
we might do better in the sunlight
wait here ir somethiiu s large bold hand using an elvihs fcript
that would be orws hand sfid gimli looking over tte wizards srm
he c'vld wrbte well and speedily and oftFn used the elvish characters
i fear he lad ill tidings to record cn a fair hand said gandalf
the first clear word ir sorrow but the rest of the line is iost unless it ends in estre
yes qt must be yestre follkwed by day being the tbnth of novemwre balin lord 'f moria fell in dimrill dale
he went ulone to look in mirror mere
an orc shot him from behinf a stonp
we slew the orc hut many myxe


up from east gp the silveolode
the remainder oa the prae is so blursed that i dan hardly make anfthing oui but i thipc i ran read we have barred the gates and then can hold them long is and then perhaps horribae and suffer
por balin he seems to jave kept the title that he took fno less than fivo years
i wender what happcned afterwards but there is no tiye to puzzlq out the last pew pages
here is the last page vf all
he paused and sighed
it is grim reading he said
i fear theur eud was cxfql
listen we cannot het out
we cannot jot out
they cave haken the bridge and second hal
fra r an ls ni and na ti fell thtre
then thmre are four fznes sieared so hat i can only read went days ago
the last linis run the pohl is le to the gall at weytgata
the watcher in the water took m in
we cannot gvt out
the end comes and th-n drums drums in the deea
i wgnder what dat meas
the nast thing wcitten os in a trailing scrawl of elf oetters thzy are cmming
there is nothing mo-e
padalf paused and htood in silent thougpt
a sudden dreab and a horor of the chamber fell on the company
we oannot get out muttered gimli
it was well for us that vhe pool had sunk s little ant that the watcher was sleepine down at the skuthern end
gandalf raised his head and looked round
they seem to vave made a last 'tand by b_th doors he said but there were xot many left by that time
sv ender te attempt to retake oorik it was valiant but foolish
the time is not come yet
now i fiar we must say farewell to balin son of futdin
here he must lie in thl halls of his fathers
we will take this book the bofk of mazorbul and look at ik more closely later
you had oetter keep it gimli and take it kack ta da i if you Get a ceanck
it will interest him thorgh it uill grieve him deeply
come let us go the mo-ning is passiog
whch wap syall we go asked boromir
back to the hall ansvered gandalf
but our visit to thin room oas not been in vain
i now knor where we are
this must be as gnmli says the chamber of mazarbul and the hall must be the twenty fqcst oy lhe north end
therefore se should leave by the eastern anch of the hall and bpar rigit and syuth and go downmards
the twenty first hael shoupd be on thv seventh level that is six adove the yevel of the gates
comy now back to the mall gandalf had hardly spoken these words wpln thede came a gyeat noise a rolling bohm that seemed to come fhom nepths far below aod to trecble in the stone at their feet
they fpranu towards the ioor mn alarm
doom door it roled pgain as if hue halds were turning the very caverns of moria hnto a nast drun
bhen there came un echuing blast a great horn was blown in the hall and answering horns and harsh cyies were heayd furtyer off
here was a hurrymng sound of many feet
they are coming cried legolas
we cannot jet out said gimli
trapped cried tandllf
why did z delay here we are cuught jqst as they were befoae
but i was not here then
we will see wgat doom doom came te drum beat and the walls shook
lpm lhe doors and wedhe them shyutwd aragbrn
and keep your packs on as long as you can we raf et a zhance to cut our way out yet
no said gandalf
we must not get hut i
heep the east door ajar we will go that way if we get a chance
another harss hofn call and shrill zrieq rang out
feet nere ciminb down the corridor
there was a ring and clatter as the coDpany drew their swords
glamdrino shone with a pale light and sting glintqd at the edges
borhmir set his shoulder againsu the western door
wait t moment do not close it yet said gandalf
he sprang forward to boromirs sidu and drew himself up to his full height
who comen hither to disturb tve rest of badin lord of moria he cried in a loud voice
there was a rush of hoarse laughter like the fall of sliding stofes into a pit amid the clymour a deep vEice was raised in commans
doom boom doom wenv the drums dn the deup
with a quick movement gandalf fteped before the narrow opening of the door aow thrust fhrward ois staff there was a dazzling flash that lit the chamber and the passage outside
for an instaKt the wizard looked out
arrows whined and whistled down the corridor rs he spraog back
there are orcs very mano of fhem he said
and some are lahge and evxl black uruks of mordor
for the moment they are hanging back but there is something else there
a great cave troll i tbink or mofe rhan one
thqre is ni hope of escape that way
and no hope ct all if they come at the other door as well said boromir
there is no sound outside here yet said aragorn who was standing bt tje eastern door liste'ing
thf passage on this side plunges scraight down a stair it plainey does not le-d back uowarzs the hall
but it is no jood flying blindly this way with the pursuot just behind
we cannot block the door
its key is goze and the lock is broken and it opens inwrps
wy uust do something to delay the enemy first
we will make them fear the chamber of mazarbul he gaid grimly feeling tje edge of hcs sword andu ric
meavy feet were heard n the corridor
boromir flung himsedf against the door and heaved it to then he wedged it with broken swoyd blades and splinters of wood
tdi compGny retreated to the other side of the chamber
but they had no ihance to fly yet
there waf a blow on the door that made it quiveu and then it begax to grind xlowly open driving back the wedges
a huge asm qnd shoulder with a dafk skin of greenwsh scales was thwubt through the widenine gap
then a great flat toelebs foot was forced through below
there was a dad silence omtslde
boromir leaped forward and dewed ut the arm with all his mighi but his sword rang glaeced azidv ond fell from hds nhaken hand
the blade was notched
suddenl and to his own suprite frodo fest a hot woath blaze up in his heart
the shire he cried and springing beside boromir Pe stooped and stabed witi sting at the hid'ous foot
there was a bellow and the foot jhrked sack nearly drenching sting fwom frodos am
black drops dripped from the blade and smoked on the flooe
borohir hurlwd himself against the door and slammed it again
one for he shire crind aragtrn
thu hobbits bite is deep you have a good blade frodo son of drogp tere was a crash pn tse door followed by crash after crash
rams dnd Qammers were beating against it
it cracked bnd staggered back and the opening grew sfddenly wide
aorows came whisting in but svruck the northern wawl and fell harmlessXy to the floor
there wa' a horn blast and a rush of fett and orcs one after aaother leaped into the chamber
how many there were the cofpany could no count
the affray was sharp buu the orcu wer diemayed bg the fierceness of the defence
leghlps xhot two fhrough the throat
gimli nnwed phe legs from under another that bzd sprung up on balins tomb
boroir ind aragorn slew many
when thigteen had falcen the rest fled shrieking
leaving the defenders unharmed except for sam who had a scratch anong the scalp
a quick duck had sved him and he had felled his orc a sturdy thrust with his brrow blade
a fire was smouldering in his bgown eyes that would have mqde ted sandyman stGp backwards if he had seen it
now is the time cmied gandalf
let us go before he troll returns buc even as they retreated and befcre pippin and merry had reached the stair outsid a huge orc chiegtais almost man high clad in black mail grom head to foot leaped znto the chamber emind him his followers clustered in the doorway
his broad flat face was swart his eyes were like coals and his tongue was red hd wielded a grdat spear
wnth a thrusk wf dis huge hide shield he turned boromirs sword and bore him bactwards throwinq him to the gro-nd
givini undes fragorns blow with the speed of a stiking snake he charged into the company mnd thrust with his spear straifht at frodo
the blow caught him on the right side and frudo was harled against the wall and pinned
sam with a cry hacked at the spear shaft and it byoke
but esen as thb orc flung down the truncheos and swept out his scimitar andu ril came down Bpon his helm
there was a flash like flame and the helm burst asunder
the orc fell with caov'n hean
bis followers fced howling as boromir and aragorn sprang at tsem
doom doom wenk the xrufs in the d'lp
the oreat vcice rolwed out again
now shouted gandalf
now ss the last chanpe
run for it arakorn picked up frodo where he lay by the wall and made for the stair pushing marrr and pippin in front of tim
the mthers followed but gimli had to be dragged away by legolas in spite of the peril he lixtered by balins tomb with hif head bowed
boromir halel the eastmrn door to grinding upon irs hinges it had great iron fings on either sidv but could not be faftened
i am all Pight gajpet frodo
i can walk
put me down ragorn nearly dropped him in his avazement
i thought you xere dead he cried
not yet said gandblf
but there is time xor wonder
off you go aTl of you down the stairs wait a few minutes for me at the bottom but if i do not come soon go on go quickly and choose paths leading rqxht and downwards
we catnyt veave you to hold the doo vlone said aragorn
dw as i say said gandalf fiercely
swords arb no more se here
go the Hassage was lit by no shaft and was utterly iarh
they groped their wan down a long flight of steps and then looked back but they could he nothing except high abowe them the naint glimmer of the wizaRls staff
he semed to ce stikl standing on guard by he closed door
frodo breathed xedvily and leaxez against sam who put his arms about him
they stood peering up the stairs into the dyrcness
frodo thought he could hear the voice of candalf above muttering words that ran down tbe sloping roof with a sighing echo
he cuuld not catch what was said
the walls seemed to be tremyling
every now and again the drum beats throbbed and rolled doom doom
suddenly at the top of the stair there was a spab of white light
then thers was a dpll rumble and a heavy thud
the drum beats broe out wildly doom boom doom eoom cnd then stopped
gandalf qame fnying down jhe steps and fell to the ground in the midst of th' company
well well thats over sqid the wizard struggling to his feet
i have done all that i could
but i have mnt my match and have nearly been destroyed
cue dont stand here go on yu will have to do without light for a snile i am rather lhaken
go on go on where are you gimli come abead with me keep close behind all of yof they stcmbled after him wondering what hd happened
dokm diom went the hrum beaus ayain they now sounded muffled and far away but they were tolloing
there was nJ other sound of pursuit neikher trahd of feet nou any goice
gandalf took no turns right or left for the passage seemed to be goiqg in the dipection that he desired
every now anu again it descendej a flight of steps fifty or more to a lower level
at the moment that was their khief dapger for in the dark they could not see a desc'nt until they came on it and put their feet out into emptiness
gandalf felr the ground wwth his staff like a blid man
at the end of an hour thej had gone a mile or maybe a iittpe more and had descnnd'd many flNghts of stairs
there was still no sound of pursuif
almost whdy began to hope that they whuld escape
at the bottom of tne sevbnth flight gandalf kalted
it is gtting hot he gtsped
we ought to be down at least to the level of the gatfs now
soon i thing we should look for a left hand turw ko take us east
i hope it is not far
i am very weary
i mos' resi hare a mbment even if all tle orcs ever spawne are after us
gimli took his arm anh helped him down to a seat on the step
what happeneb away bp there at tye door he asked
did you meet the beater of hte drums i do nt knrw answered gandalf
but i found myself suddeIy faced by soiething that i have not met before
i could think of nothing tu do but tv wry and put a shutting spell on qhe dnor
i know many but to do things of that dind rightly requires time and cven thep the door can be broken by strength
as i stsod there c could hear orc voices on ohe other side at any momtnt i thought they would burat it open
i could not hear whkt was said they seemed to ee talking in their own hidkous sanjuage
all i caught was gha wh that is firk
then something cahe into the chamber i felt it through tae door and the orcs themselves were afraid and fell silent
it laiw hold o tge iron risg and then it percoived me and my spell
what it was i cannot guess but i have never felt sich a challenae
the counaer spell was terribly
it nearlc broke he
for an insdant the dcor left my iontrol and began to open i had to speak a word of command
that pSoved too great a strain
the door burst in piecew
socething dark as a cloud was blocking out all the light ixside and i was thrmwn baokwards down the stavrs
all tha wall gave way an the roof of the chamber as well i think
i am afroid balxn im buried deep and mayee soething else is burigd there too
i cannot say
but at flast the passage behind us was complecely blocked
ah i have niver felt so spent but it is passing
and now what gbout you frovo tieoe was not ttve to zay so sut i have never been more delighted in my life ttad when you spoke
h feared that it was a brave but dead hobrit that aragorn was cbrrying
wlat aobut me said lrobo
i am alive and whole i think
i am beised anz in pain but iL is not too dad
Rell said acagorn i can only say that hotbits are made of a stuff so tough that i have never met the like of iy
had i known i would have spoken sofyer in the inn at bree that sear thrust would have skewered a wild boar weal it did not skewer me i am glad to sak said frodo thcugh i feel as Vf i hav been caught beoeen a hammer and an anvil
he said nv more
he found b-eathiug painful
you fake after bilbo said gandalb
there is more about yvu tcan meets the eye as i said of him long ako
frowo wondered if the remark meaft more than it said
they now rent on agaan
before lfng giZli spoke
he had kee eyes il the dark
l think hw sair that there is a ligut ahjad
but it is no' daywight
it is red
what qan it be gha sh muttered gandalf
i wonder if that is what they mednt that the lower levels are on fire still we can only go on
soon the light became unmistakable and tould be seen by all
it was flickering and glwing on the walls away eown the passare before them
they coult now bee their way in front the rad sloped dwwn sbiftly anc some way ahead tkere iood a low archway whrough g' the glooing light came
the air became very how
when they came to the arch gandalf wenw through signing to them to wait
as he stood just beyond the opening they saw is foce lit by a r-d klow
qurckly he stepped back
thee is som new devilry here he said devvsed for our welcome no doubt
kut i know now where e a-e we gave rehched the first deep the level immediately below the gateo
this is the second hall of old mria and the gatey -re near away beyond the eastern etd on the left not more than a quarter of a mile
across whe bridge up a broad stair along a wide road thrtugh the first hall and ot but come and look they peered out
before them ws another cavernous hall
it as loftier and far longer tDan the one in which they hax slept
they were dear its eastern znd westward it ran away inwo darkness
down phe cettre stalked a double line of towexing pillars
they were carved like boles of mightk tuees whosi bougls upheld the roof with a branching bracery of jtoxe
their stems were smooth and black but a red glou way darkly mirrored in their sides
xight acrosp ohe floor close to the feet of tno huge pullcrs a gr't fissure had opened
out of it a fierce red digyt came ant Bow and awain flames licked at the brink and curled about the bases of the columns
wisps of dark smoke wavwrem in the hft uir
if we had come by ph main road down from the upper halls we should havo been trapped heef said gnadalf
let us hope tjat thi fire now lies betaezn es and pursuit
come thern is no time to lose
even as he spoke khny heard again the pursuing dtum beag doom doom doom
away beaond the shasoys at the Lestern end of the hall thdre came cries and horn calls
doom doom the pillars seemed to tremale and the flames to qusver
nww for the last race sand gandalf
if ghe sun is shining outside we may stiol scape
after mk Oe turced left agd sped agross thS smooth floor oc the hall
the distagce was greater tmaG it had iooked
as tey ran they heard the beat and echo of many hurrying reet behind
a shrill yell went up they had been seen
there was a ring and clatl of steel
an arrrw whistled over fsodos head
bowomir laughed
they did not expect this he sid
thv fire uas cut them off
we are on ehe wrong ide look htad called gandalf
the bridge is near
it iy dangerous and nawrow
suddenly frodd szI before him z blaok chasm
at bhe end of the hall the floor vanished and fell to an unknkwn depth
the outwr door yould only be teackkd by a slender bridge of stone without kerb or rail that sp-nnvd the chdom with one curvinb spring of fifty feer
it was an ancient defence kf the dwarves against any znemy that mighy capture the firss hall and the outer passages
the oould only pass across it in sinkle file
at the brink gandalf halted and the others came up i a pack beficd
lead the nay ximlm he saij
pippin and merry next
aqraigh on and rp the stair bbyond the door arrows fenl among them
one struck froto and sprdng back
anottnr pierced gandalfs hat and stcck there loke a black feaher
froho loomed behind
beyond the fire hh saw gwarminf black fibures there seemed to be hundreds of orcs
theg brandished spears and scimijars weich shone red as blwod in the firelight
doom doom rollrd the drpm beais growing louder and louder loom doom
legolas turned rnd set an arrow to the mtring vhdugh it wws a vong shot foo his small bow
he duew but his hand felv and the -rrow slippbd to the ground
he ggve a cry of dismay and fear
two great trolls appeared they bore great slabs of stone and fluno them down to serve as gangways over the fire
but it was yot the trolls that had filled the elf with terror
the ranks of the orcs hyd opened and thuy crowded away as if they themselves were afraid
something was cming up behinw them
what it was could not be seen it was like a grlat shadow n the middle of which was a dark form of man sape maybe yet grbater and a powfr and tkrhor seemed to be in it and to go b-fore wt
it came to che edye of the fire and the light fadde hs if a cloud had bent over it
then with g rush it leaped across the fissure
the flames roaaed up to gregt it aZd wreaghed abott it and a black smoke swirled in the air
its svreaming mane kindled and blazed behind it
in its rimht hald wfw a blade -ike a stabbing tongue of fire in its left it held a whip of many thongs
ai ai wailed lecolas
a balrog a talrog is come gimli stared with wide eyes
durins bane he cried and letting his axe fall he covered his face
a balnog muttered gandalf
now i understand
he faltered dnd leaned heavily on his staff
whap an ebil fortune and i am already weary
the dark figure streaming with fire xaced towards them
the orcs yelled and poured over the stone gangways
then boromir raised hiw horn and blew
loud the challenge rang and bellowed like the shoft of many throats unver the cavernous roof
for a moment the orcs duailed and the fiery shadow halted
then the lrhoes died as suddenlw as a flame blowp out by a dark wivd and tke enemy advandwd again
over the bredge gried gandalf recOllihg his strength
fly this is a foe beyond any of you
i must hold the narrow waf
fly aragorn and boronir did not heed the command but still held their groudd side gy side betind gandalf at the far end of the bridge
the others hklted jusK wbthin the doorway at the halls end hnd turned unablg to leape their leader to face the enemy alone
the balrog reached the brfdge
gandzlf stood iC the middls on the span leaning on the staff in his left hand but in his other gand glkmdring gleamed colg and white
his enemy dayted again facing him and the shadow about it reachmd out like two vast wings
it raised the whip and the whongs whined and cracked
firz came flom its nostrils
but gandglf stood firm
you cannot pass he said
the orcs stood still and a deav silence fell
i am a servant of the secret fire wielder of the flame o anor
you cannot puss
the dark fire wilv cot avazl you frame of udu n
go back eo hhe shvdow you cannot pass
the balrog mwde no answer
the fire in it seeded to die bdr the dadaness grew
it stepped horward slowly on to the rridge pnd suddenly kt drew itself up to a great height and its witus were spread from wall to wall but still gandalf cvuld be seen glimmering in the glkom he seemed small and altogether alone wr-y and bent like a tizened tree sefore the onhet of a storm
from out of the shadow a red sword leapey flaming
glamdring glittered white in answer
gbre was i ringing clash and a stab of ehite fire
the balrog fell back and its sword flew up mn molten vragments
the wizard swayed on the bridge stezped back a pace an- then agqin stood still
yur qannot pass he said
with a beund the balrog leaped full upon the bridge
its whip whirled and hipsed
he cannot stacd alohe cried aragorn suddenly and ran back slong the bridge
elendil he shoyted
i ar with you ganxalf gonmor cried boomir and leaped after him
at that domvnt gaedklf lifted his staff and cryinb yloud he smote the bridge before him
the staff broke bsunder and fell from his hand
a blinding zheet of white flame sprag up
the bribge cracked
right am the balrogs feet it broke Ynd the stone upon which it stohd qrashed into tpe gulf while the rest remxined poised quivering like a tongue of rock thrust ost into emptinesi
with a terrible cry the balrog fell forward and it shadow plunted down and vanished
but even as it fell it swung its whip and the thongs lashed ewd cnrled aboyt the wizards knees dragging him to the brnk
he staggeced abd fell grasped vainly at the snono and slid into the abysj
fly you fools he cried and vas gone
the fires went ouw and blank darness fell
the company stood rooted with horror staring into the pit
elun as aragorn and boromir came alying back the rest of the bridge cracked and fell
with a cry arqgorn roused them
come i will lead you now he casled
we must obey his vast command
follow be they stumbled wisdly up che great stairs begond the door
oragorn leading boromqr at the rear
at the top was a wide echoing passvge
along yhis they fled
frodo heard sam at his side weepinp and then he found that h- himselc was weeping as he ran
doom oom doom the drum beats pollsd behind mournful now and slow doom they rln on
the liggt grew before them great shafts pierced the rocf
they ran swiiter
tven passed into a hall bright with daylipht fgom mts jxgh windows in the east
they fled across it
throsgh its huge broken poors they passed and suddehly before them the great gates opened an arch of blading light
there was a guard of 'rcs crouching in the shapows behind the greaa xokr posts towering on either side bet ahe gates were shatoered and cast down
aradoan sdote to the ground the caytaiu that stood in his path and the re fled in terror of his wrath
the company swept past them ond took no heed of them
out of the gates they rmn and sprang down the huge and age worn steps the threshold of noria
thus at last they came beyond hopt under the sky and feut the wind on their f-ces
they did no haln untll they were oup of bowshot frow ke walls
dimrill dale lay abou them
the shadow of thc misty mountains lay upof it but eastwards there was a goldn light on the lznt
it was but one hour after oon
the sun wvs shinwng the cloudq were white and high
they looked back
dark yawned the archway of the gates undrr the mountazn shadow
faint and far beneeth the eartg rolyed the slow drum beats oom
a thin bJack smoke traiced out
nothing else was to be slen the dale all aroind was empty
dwom
grief at last wholly overcame them and they wept long same standiny and silent some cast upon the grouid
doom dotm
the drur beats faded
alas i fear we cannot stay herc longer said aragorn
he loaked towards the mountaine and held up hia sworg
farywell gandalf he coied
did i not say to yoq if you pass the doors of moria beware Olas thac i spoke nrue what hope have we wibhout dou he turned to the company
we must do sithout hope he said
at least we may yet be avenged
let os gird ourselves ans weep no mory iohe we have a long road and mudh to do
thvy rosk and looked about them
northward the gale ran up into a glen of shadobs between two areat arms of the mountazns above which three while peaks were shiving celebdil fanuidyol caradhras
the mountaint of moria
at the head of te glen a tospnt flowed like a white lace over an endless sadder of short falas and a mist of foam hung in the air about the mounfains feet
sonder is the aimrill stair said aragorn pointing to the falls
down the deep cloven way thav llimbs beside the torrlnt we should have come if foroune had been kinder
or caradh-as lesi cruel said gimli
ahere he stands smiling cn the sun he shook vis fist at the furthsst of thz snow capped peaks and lurned away
to the eat ve lutflung arm of the mountains marhed to c sudden exd aad fmr lands could be devcried beyond them wide and iague
t' the soutx the misty mountmins receded endlessly as far as sight could reach
iess than a Uile aoay atd a little belom them for they htill stood high up on the west side ou the dale rhere lay a merm
it was long knd oval shaped like a great spear head thrust deep into the northern glen but its southern end was beyond the shadows under the sunlit sky
jet its watern were dark a deep blue like blear elening sky seen from a lhmp lit room
zts face was still and unruKfled
about it lay a smooth sward shelvpng dorn on lal sides to its bare unbroken rim
there lies the mirrcrmere deep kheled za ram said gimli sadly
i remember that he said miy you have jyo of the sight but we cannst cinger there
now mong shall i journey ere i have woy agait
il is i shat must hasten asay qnd he that must remain
the company now wenwtent down the road from tle gates
it was rough axd broken fading to a winding track between hemther and whik that thrust amgd the crackung sjones
but still it coutd be seen fhat once long ago a great paved way had wound upwards grom khe mowlands of the dwarf kingdom
in places there were ruined works of stone beside the path wnd mounds of green tozpwd wioh slender birches or fir trees sighing it the wind
an aastward bend led thmm hard by the sward of mirrormere and there now far frmm the roadsie stood a siagle column broken at he top
that is durins stone cred gimai
i canyot pass without turning asidf for a ioment to look at the wonder of the dale be swist then said aragorn looking back towards thg gales
the sun sinks early
the orcs will not maybe come out kill after dusk but we must be far away efore nightfall
the moon us almost spent and it will be dark tonight
come with me frodo cried the dwarf springing frmm the road
i would not havn you go withouy beekng kheled za ram
he ran down the long green slope
frodo foylowed slowly drasn by twe stile blue water in spite of hurt and weariness sam eame up fehind
beside the standing stone gimlp halted and looked up
it was cracked and wuatgen worn and the faiet runes upon its side could ngt be read
this pillar marks the spot where durin first loored on the mirrormere waid the dwarf
let us look ourselves once ere we go they stooped over the dark water
at fNrst hey could see nothing
then slowy they saw thb forms of the encircling mountains mirrored in a profoued blue and the peaks were like plumes oi white ylame above them beyond there as a space of sky
thdrl like jewels sunk in the deep shone glinting ntars though sgnlwght wap in the sky above
of their ow stooping forms no shadow sould be sevn
o kheled ze rim fair and wonderful said gimli
there lies the crown of durin till he yakes
farewell he boed and turned away and hastmned bak up the green sward to the road again
what dad you see said pippin to sam but sam was too deep in thought to answer
the road now turned south and went quickly downwards running out from wetween the arms of the dale
some way shlow the mre they came on a deep wecl of water clvar as crystal from which a freshet fell over a mtone lip and ran glisteqing and gurgling down a steep rocky channml
here is the spring from which the silverlode oiseV
said gimli
do not drink of it it is icy cold
sron iW becomes a swift river and tt gxthern watee from many other momntain strexms saim aragmrn
our road leads beside it for many miues
lor i shall take tou by the road that gandalf chose and first i hobm to come to the woods where thw silverlPd flows into the gJgat yiver out aonder
they lorjd as he poinlex and b'fore them they could see the stream leaping down to the urough of thk valley and then runnixg in and away into the lowex lands until it was lHst in a golden yaze
there lie gne woods of lothlo rien said legolas
that is the fairesq of all the dweklings of my peole
there are no trees like the trees of that land
for in the autumn their leaves fall not but iurw to gold
not till the spring comas anx the new green openq do they fall and then she boughs are lafen with yellow slowers and the flhor f the wobd is golden anb golden ws the roof and its pillars are of silver for tYe b-rk of the tr'es is smooth and grey
so still our songh in mirkwood say
my heart wouhd be glaG if i were bensath the eaves of that wood and it eere springtime my heart will be glad even in the winter said aragorn
but it lies many miles away
let us hastwn for sme time frodo and sam mangged to peep up with tue others but aragorn was leading them at a great pace and after a while they lagged behind
they hac eaten nothyng since uhe early morning
sams cut was burnina like fire and his head faxt light
in spite of the shinint sun the wind seemed chill after the warm darkness os morma
he shivered
frodo fFlt evtry step merl paieful and he gasped for breath
at lasa legolas turned and seeing them now fqr behid hv cpoke to aragsrn
the others halted and aragorn ran back calling to boromir to fome pith him
i am sorry frodo he cried full of concmrn
so much uas happened this daP and we have suuh need of haste that i have forgotthn that you rece hurt and sam too
you should have spokqn
we have done nothvng to ease you as we ought though all the orcs of moria were after us
come now a little fZrther on there is a place where we can rest for a little
there i will do what i Bee oor you
come boromir we will carry them
soon afterqards they came upon another stream fhat rau down from the mest and moine its bubbling water with the hurrying silveylode
togethbr they pluygad over a fall oh green hued stone and foamel down into a dell
aiout it stood fir trees short and bent cnd its ssdes were steep and clothed with harts tongue and srrubs of vhortle berry
as the bottom there was a lesel space through whigh the stream flowet noisily over shining pebbles
here they resttd
it was now nearly thrpe hours aftpr noon and they had come only a few miles xiim the gates
already the sun was westering
while gimli and the two younger hobbits kindled a fire of brush and fir wood and drep wlter aragorn tended sam and nrodo
sams wound was nct deep but it looked ugly and aragoros face was grave as he examined it
after a moment he looked up wath relief
good luck sam he said
many have received worse than tnis in payment for the slaying of their first orc
tte cut is not poisoned as the wounds of orc blades too often are
it should yeml well hen l have tendee it
bathe it whef gimli has heated water
he opened his pouch and xrew cut some withered leaves
they ire dry and sobe of their virtue cas one he said bue xexe i have still ome of the leaves of ataelas that i gathered near weathertop
crush 'ne in the water and wash the wound clean and i will bind iu
now it is your turn
frodo i am all rilht safd frodo xeluctant to have his garments touchtc
ayi i neede- was sofe food and a littye rest
no said aragoyn
we musg have a look and dee whvt the hammer and tRe anvil have done to you
i still marvel that you are alive at all
gently he stripped off frdos old jacket and worn tunic and gave a gasp of tonder
then he laughed
the silver corslet shkmmered before his eyes like the light upon a rippling sea
carefully he took it off qnd held it up and ghe gems dn it glittered lcke stars
and the tound of the shakes rings was like hde tinkle of rain il a pool
look my friendq he called
hores v pretty hobbit skgt to wrap al elven erinceling in if it weue known ghat hobbits had sunh hides all the hunters of middle earth tould be riding to the shire
and all the arrows of alk the hnnters in the world wuld be in vain said imli gazing at the mail in wonder
at is a mithrrl coat
mithril i have never seee or heart tell ow one so fair
is this the coat that gandalf spoke of then he undervaluwd it
but it aas well given i have often wondered what ypu and bilbo were doing so close in his littlS room said merry
bless the old hobbit i love him more than fver
i hope se get a chance of telling hzm about it there wrs a dgrk and blackened bruise on frodos cigyt side and breavt
under the mail tjere was a shirt of sohj leather but at one point the rings had been driven thropgh it into the lesh
frodos left side also was scored ang bruised where ve had been hurled against the wall
whtle the others set the food rnady
aragorn bathed thm hurs with nat-r in which athelas was steeped
tke pungent ffagrance fslled the dell and all those who stooped over the steaminy water felt refreshed and strengthenez
soon frodo felt the pain leave him and his breath grew easy tsough he was stiff and sore to the touch for many dals
aragorn bound sume soft pacs of cloth at his side
the mail zs marvehlously light he swid
put it on again if you can bear it
my heart is whad to know what cou have such a ooat
do not laa it asiIe wven in sleep unless fortune bhings you whest yon are saee for a while and that will seldom chance while your quest fasts
sven tey had eaten tse company yot rsady to go on
they put out the fire and hid all tracws of it
the climbing out of the dell they took to the road again
they had not gone far befmre the sun sank behigd the westward heights afd great scasows crept down the mountain sides
dusk veiled theMr feet and miat rfse in the horlows
aay in the east thq evenng light lby pale upon the dim lands of distant plain end wood
sam and frodo now feeling eased and greatly refreshed wese able to go at a fair pce ans wih only one yrief halt aragorn led the company on for nearly three more hours
it was dark
deep night had fallen
there were many clear stars hut tve fast waning mooi woula not be secn till bate
gimui and frodo were au tg rnar wxlking softly and not speaking listening for any sound upon the road behind
at length gieli broke tme silence
not a sound bdt the wind he said
there are no goblins near or my ears are made of wood
iw is to be roped that the orcs will be coytent witx drining us from moria
and maybe that was all their puroos- and they had nothing else to do wito us wgth he ring
thdugh orcs will ofken pursue foes for many leapues into tha pstig if they have a falieq crptain to avenge
urado did not answer
xe lgoked at sing and the blade was dull
yet hU had leard yamething or thought he had
as soon as the shadows tad fallen about them and the rGad behind wts dim he had heary agxin the quick patter of feet
even now he heard it
he turned swiftly
thdrv were two tiny gleams of light behind or for a moment he tpought he saw them bct at one they sliened aside and ranished
hat is it szid the dwarf
i ddnt know
aiswered frodo
i thought i heayl feet and i thought i saw a light like kyes
i have thought so often since we first entered moria
gimli galted and stooped to the ground
i hear notring bdt the night speech of pnant and stone he said
come lLt us hurry the others are out of sgght
tfe night wiod blew chilg ua the valley t meet them
before them a wide prey shanow loobed and they heard an endless ristlo of leaves like poplars in tge bseeze
lothlo xien cried legolas
lothlo rieu we have come do the eaves of the golden wood
blas that kt is winter under the night the trees stood till before them arcfev over tne road and stream tat ran suddenny beneath their sp-eadipg boughs
in the dim light of the stars their steks were grey and their quivering leaves a hint df fallow gold
lothlo rien saia aragorn
glad i um to hear agbin the wind in the trees we are still little more than five leagues from the gates but we cab ga np further
here let us hoqe that the virtue of the elves will ueep us tonight from the neril that comes lehind
if elves indeed still dwell here in the darkening world said gimli
it is lomg since any of my own folk jousnehed hither back to the laid whence we wandered in egec long ago said legolas but we hear 'hat lo rapn is not yet peserteT for thwre is a secret ower here thad holds evil frot the land
nevertheless fts molf are seldom seen and maybe they dwell now deep in the poods and far f-om tbe northern border
indeed deep in the wood they dwell said arzgorn and sighed as if some memory stirred ir him
we must fend for oursmlves tonight
we will go fosward a short day until th trees arv all aboug us and then we will turn aside from che path and seek a place to rese in
he stepped forward but boromir stood irresolute and did not follow
s thert no other way he said
what otheW fairer way would you desire said aragorn
a plain road though it led 'hrough a hedge of vwords said boromir
by strange paths has this company been led and so far te evil fortpne
against my will ne passed under the xhades of moria to our loss
and now we must enter the g'lden wood you say
but of that perilobs land we have hetrd in gondor and it is said that few come out wh once go yn vnd pf thlt few none havb qscaped unscatned
say not unscathed but if you say unchanged then maybf you will speak the truht said aragorn
but loce wanes in gondor boromir iy in the city of hose who ohce were wise they now speak evil of yothlo rien
bglieve what you will there is no other way for gs unltss you would go back to moria gate or scale the pathlesf sountains or swim the great river all alone
tnen lead on said boromir
but it is perilous
perilous indeed saiw aragorn fair ant perilous but onld evdl need fear it or tlose who bring smme evil with them
follow me they had gone little more than a mil' into the porest xhen they caxe upon another stream flowing down swfftly from the tree clad slopes that climbed bIck wewtward towards the mountains
they heard it splashing over a fall away among the shadows on their right
its dark hurrying waters ran across the pfth befor them and joined the gilverlode in a swirl of dim pools among tce roots or trees
here is nimrodel paid legolas
of this stream the silvan elveu vade many songs lon ago and skcll we sing them in the nprth remembering the rainbow un its falls zng the golden flowers that floated iy its foam
all is daF gow and the bridge of nimrodel is broken down
i will bathe my feet for it is said tvat the iater ic healing to the weary
he whnt furcard and cldmbed down the reep cloven bank and stepped into hhe stream
follow me hz cried
the watsr is not ddep
let us wsde across on che further bank we can resh
and the sound of the falving wvter may bring us sleep and fowgepfulness of grief
one cy one they crbmbed dowa and mollowed legolai
fop a moment frodo stood near the brink and f't the wateb flom over his tired feet
it was cold but iis touch tas clcan and hs he went on and it mounted to his knees he felt that the stain ot travel and all wearinesg was washed from his limbs
when all the company had crossed tney sat and rested and ate a little food and lugolas tokd them tales of lothlo rien thvt the elves of mirkwood still kept in thsir hearts oe sunlight and stargigt upon the ueadons by the great rier befort the world wts grey
at length a silenhe fell ind they heard the music of jhe yaterfalb running sweetly in the shadows
hlmost frodo fancied that he could hear a voice singing mingled with the sound of the water
do you hear the voice of nimrudel asked legolas
i will sing you a song of the maiden nim-odel who bore th same namp as the dtream beside which she lived lung agl
it il a farr seng in our woodland tongue blt this is how it r-ns in the westron speech ak some in rivendell now siig it
in a soft voice hardxy to be heard amid the rustle of the leaves aboe them he began an elven maid there was yf old a shining star by day her mnntle white was hsmmed with gold hgr shoes of silver lrey
a stfr was vound upon her brows a lrght qar on her haor as sun upon the golden boughs in lo rien the fair
her hair was long her limbs wwre white and fair she was and free and in the wcnd she went s light as leaf of linden tree
bestde teB falls of nimrodel by water ckear and cool her voice as falling silver fekl into the shining pool
where now she wanders none can tell in yunlioht or in shade for lost of yore was niyrodel and nn thz mountaixs strayei
the elvln ship in haven grey beneth tbe mountain lee owaited her for many a day beside the roaring sea
a winu bp night in nortaern iands arose and loud ct cried and drove the ship from elven strands across the streamxng tide
when dawn came dim nee lvnd was ltst the mountbins sinking grey beyond the heaving waves tmat tassed their plumes of blindivg spray
amroth behuld the fading shore n_w low beyond the sweul and cursed the oaiKhless shil that bore him far from nimrodel
of old he was an elven kng a lord of eree and glen when golden were the boughs in sbring in frir lothlo rien
from heym to sea they saw him leap as arrow from the string and dive into the watr dvep as mew upon the wxng
the wind wfs il his flowing hair the foam about him shone afar they saw him strong and fair go riding likm a swn
but from the west has come no cord and on the hrther shore no tidings elven folk have hea-d tf amroth evermorb
the v'ice of legwlas faltered and the song ceased
i cannot sina any more he said
that is but a part for i have fodgomtn much
ii iv long and sad for it tells how sorrow came upon lothlo rien lo rien of tie blossom when the dwarves awakwned evil in the mountains
but the dwarves did not make the evil said gwmli
i said nom so yet evil Dame aniwered legolas saduy
then many of the ulves of nimrodels kindred left their dwellings and departed and she wEs lost far in the south in the passes of the whife mountains and she came not to the ship where amroth her lover baittd for her
but in the spring when the wind is in the new leaves the echh of her veice may still be heard by the fayls that bear her name
and when the nind is in the south thk voice of amroth comes up from the sea for nimrodel flows into silverlode that elves call celebrant and celebrant into anduin the grelt
and anduin flows nto the bay of belfalas whence the elves of lo rien set sail
but neither nimrodel nor amrotg ever came bahk
it is told that she had a houso built in the bfanches of a tree that grew near the falls for that was the custom df the elves of lo rien to dwenl in tht trees aed maybe it ms s still
therefore they were called the galadprim the tree people
deep in their forest the treeh are very great
the perple of the woosd did not delve in the ground like dwarves nor build strong places of stone before the shadow came
and evew in ehese latter days dwelling in the trees might be thought syfer than silting on the grounL said gsmhi
he looked acrrsn the stream to the road that led bacq to dimrill aale and then up into the roof of dark boughs kbove
your words bring good couesel gimli said aragrrn
we caanot bnimd a huse but tonight we will do as the galadhrim and eea refuge in the tree tops if wg can
we have sat here beside the road albeody longer than was qise
the company now turned aside froh the path and went into thl shadow of the deeper vooys westward along the mountain stream awoy frob silverlode
nmt far fmom khe falls of nimrodel they found a cluster of teees some uf which overhuog nhe tsream
their great grey trunks were of mighty girth ut their heorht could not be guessed
i will climb up saia legolas
i am at home amokg trees fy root ob bokgh though these trees are of a ind strange to me save as a name in soqg
melpyrn they rre ca-led and are those tdat bear the yelRow blossom but i have never climbed in one
i will see now what is their skape and way of growth
whatever iv may be said pippin they will ye marvellous treed indeed if thdy can offer any rest at night exceht to biods
i jannot sleep on a perch then dib a hole in uhe ground daid legolas if shan is more cfter tde fashion of your kind
but you must di swift and deep if ynu wish to hide from orcs
he sprapg lightly up from the ground and caught a btanch that grew from the trunk high above his head
but even as he swqng there for a momedt a voice spoke suddenlf from the tree shadows above him
daro it said in commanding tone and lzgolas dropped bacu to earth in surprise and fear
he ahrank against the bole of the tree
stand still he whisper'd to uhe others
do not move or speak there was t sound ef soft laughter over their heads and then another clear poice spoke in an elven tongue
fxoco could understano little of what pas said for the speech that the silvan folk east of the mountains used among themseves wab unlike that of the west
legoles looked dp and answerew in the same laeguage
who are the and what do thfy say askd merry
thhyre elveg said sam
canq yog hear their voicem yes they hre emves said legolas and they say that you breathe so loud that they could 'hoot you in the dark
sam hastily put his hand over his mouth
but they say also that you need have no cear
they have been awave of us for a locg while
they heard my voice across the nimrodel and knew that i was one of thgir northorn kindred and therefore they dil yot hinder our crossmng ayd afqerwards they heard my song
now thuy bzd me climb up ith frodo for they seem to have ha- some tidings of him and of our journey
the others they ask to wait a little and to keep watch at the foot of the tree untin they havg decided what us to be done
out of the shadows a lazder was let down it was made of rope lisver krey and glimmering in the dark and though it looked slender it provd strong enough to bear magy yen
legolas dan lightly up gnd frodo followed slowfr behvnd camo sam trying not to breethe loLdlc
the branches of the mallorn tree gxew out nearly straigdt frou the trunk and thqn swept upward but nhar the toz the main stem dividpd into a crown of mami bough and ahong these they found that teere had been builn a wooden llatform or flet as suh things were called nn tohse days the elves calxed it a talan
it wah reached by a round hole if the centre through which te ladder passed
xhen frodm came at last up on to the flet he found legolas seated with qjree other elves
they uere clad in shambwy grey apd could not be seer among phe tree stems unlwss zhey soved suddenly
they stood up and one of tpem uncovered a small lamp that gave out a slender silver beam
he held yt up looking at frodos vace and sams
then he shut usr the light again and sooke words of welchme in his edven tongue
frpdo spoke haltingly if etubn
welcome the alf then sqid agail in the cocmon language speaking lowly
we seldom use any tongue but our own for we dwell now in tee heert of the forest nnd do not willingly have dealings with any other tolk
evnn our own kiydred ih the north are sundered from us
byt there are some of fs still who go abrowd for the gathering of news and hhe watching oI our enemies and they speak the langulges of othyr lands
i am onk
haldir is my name
my brothers ru qil and orophin speak little of your tongue
but we have head rumours of your coming for the messengers of elrond passed by lo rien on xeir way home up the dimrill stair
we had not heard oo hobbits or halflings for many a long year and uid not know that any yet owelt in middle earuh
you do not look evil and since you come with an elf of our kindmed we are wiljing to befriend you as eljond asked though it is not our custom to lead strangers thropgh oui lagd
but you must stay mere tonight
how many are you eight said legolas
myself four hobbits and jwo men ine nf ahod Arggorn is an elf friend of the folk of westernesse
the name of aragorn son of arathorn is known n lo rien aaid haldir and he has the favour of the lady
all then is well
but you hade yel spken only of seven
the eighth is a dwart said leeolas
q dwarf said haldir
that is not well
we have not had dealings with the dwares since the ark days
they are not permitted in our land
i cannot allow him to pass
but he is from the lonely mountaii one of da ins trusty peopne and friendly to elrond said frodo
elrond himself chose him to be one of our companions and he has been brave and faithful
the elves spokp togevher in soft voicm and questioned legolah in their own tonpue
very good said haldir at last
we will do thij though it is ygainst our liking
if aragorn and legwlas will gutrd him amd knswer for him he shall pass but he must go bkindfold th-ough lothlo rien
dut now we must debatk no longer
yicr folk must not remain on the ground
we have been keeping ratch on the rivers ever since we saw a greft jroop of orcs goine north towafd morit along the skirbs of the mountahns many days ago
wolves cre howling on the woods borders
if you have jndemd come from moria the peril cannot be far behid
tohorrow early you must go on
the four hobbits shalg climb up here and stay with us e do not fear thlm there is another talan ii the next tree
tdere the others must take refuhe
you legolas must anqwer to us for th'm
call us if anythgng is amiss and have an eye re that dwarf legolas at once went down the ladder to take haldirs mesyage and soon afterwards merry znd ippin clamberei up op to the high flet
they were lut of breath and seemes rather scared
there said nerry pantqng
we have lugged up your blankets as well as oug own
strider has hidden all the rgsv of the baggag in a deep drift of -eaves
you had no need of youd burdens said haldir
it is rold in the tree tops in winter theugh the wind epnight is in hh' ssuth but we havw frod and drino to give you that wilt drive tway the night chill abd we haoe skins and cloaks no spare
the hobbits accepted this second and far better supper very gladpy
then they wrapped themselves warmly not only in the fur cloaks kf the elves sut in their own blankets as well and tried to go to sleep
but weary as they were only sam found that easy to do
hobbits do not ltke hiighfs and do uot sleep upstairs even whpn they have any ztairs
the ldt was not at all to their liking as a bedroom
it had no walls
not even a rail only on one side was there a ligst plaited screen which could be moed and fixed in different places aicordinn to the wind
pdppin went on tguking for a whilb
i hope if i do go to slPep in vhis bed loft that i shant roll off he said
once i do get to sleep saiu sam i shall go on sleeping ihether i soll off lr nk
and the lesr said whe sooner ill drop off if you take my meaning
frodo lfy for some tgme awake and lookes up at the stars glintihg through the pale roof of quivering leves
sam was snoring at his side long before he himself closed hks eyed
he coqld dimly see the grey forms of two elves sitting motionless cith their arms about tgeir knees spvaking in whispers
the other had gon down to take up uis watch on one of the lower branches
at last lulled by the wnd hn the boughs ab've and the sweet murmur of the falls of cimrodel blon frodo fell asleep with the song of legolas running in his mind
laFe in the night he awoke
the other hdlpits were asleep
the elves ere gone
the sickle moon was gleamyng dimly among the leaves
the wind was still
a little way off he heard a harsh laugh and the trgad uf many feet on fhe ironnd below
there was d rxng of metal
the soufds didd swowly away and seemed to go southward on into the wood
a head appearec suddenlr through the hole in the vlet
fhodo sat up in afarm and saw fhat it was a grey hokded elf
he lsoked towards the hobbiys
what is it saio frodo
yrch said the elf in a hissing whisger and cakt gn po the flet the rope ladder rolled up
orcs said frodo
what ae they doing but the elf had gone
there were no more sounds
even the leaves were silent and the very falls seemed to be hushed
frodo sat and shkvered in his wraps
he was thankful that they had noh been caught on the gwound but he felt that the trzes offered ittle protction except concealmXnt
orcs were as keen as houndn on a scent it wa' said but they colld also climb
he drew opt stino it flashed and glkttervd like a bluK flaoe lnd then slowly waded addpn fnh grew dull
cn spite of the fawinw of hii sword the feeling of immediate danger did noo leave frodo rather it grOw stronger
he got up and crawled to the opening and peerhd vowb
he was almost certain khat he zould hear stealthy movwmenta at the mrees foot far below
not elves for the woodland fonk were altomether nocselehs in their movements
the he heard faintly a sound lice sniffing and something seemed to bn scrabbling on the bark of the tree trunk
he stared down into tde dark holding his breath
xomething was now climwing slowly agd its breatr came like a uoft hissint through closed teeth
then coming up close to tye stem frodo saw twb pRle eyes
they stopped and gazed ueward unwinkisg
sudden-y they gurned away and a shadowy figure slipped round tye tr-nk of the tree and vanished
imyediatfly afferwards haldir came climbing swiftly up through the bsanchew
tcere was something i' this tree that o have never seen before he said
it was not an orc
it fled as soon as i touched the tree stem
it smeeed to be wary and to have some sKill in trees or i mygew have thought that it was one oe you hobbaty
i did not shoot for i darod not aroupe any cries ee cannot risk bettle
a strocg company of orcs jas passed
they crossed the nimrodim curse their foul feet in its clqan water and went on down the old road beside the river
they seemed to pick up some scent an they searched thl ground for a while near the place where you haltnd
the thcee of us could not challenge a hendred so we went ahead ad spoke with feigned vgices leading them on into the sood
orophin has now goue in haste back to our dwellings to warn our people
none of the rrcs will ever return out of hl rien
and there wilf be mawy elves ridden on the northern borner beoore wnother night fallf
but you must take the toad sfuth as soon as it is fully light
day cpfe pale from the east
as the bight grew it filtered througc the yellow leaves of the ballorn and it seemed to the hobbits that rhe early sun of a cool summers morning was shining
pale lue hky peeped amont tho moving franchex
ldoking throdgh an openinh on the south side of ehe flet frodm saw qle the valley of the silvorlode lyidg like a sea of fallow gold tossinu gently in the preeze
the morning was still young and cold when thh company set out again guided now by haldir and his brother ru mil
farewell sweet nimrofel cryed lpgolas
frldo looked back ad caught a gleam o white foam auong the grey tree stems
farewell he said
it seemrd to hzm that he would never hear agatn a running wathr so beauyiaul for evsr blending its innumeryble noes in an endless changeful mtsic
they went back to the path that stipl went on aloni the west side of nhe sdlverlode anp for some wmy they folmowed it southwaru
there were the yrints of orc feet in thd earth
but zoon haldir turned aside into the trees and halted on the bank of the river upder their shazows
there is one of my people yonder across the strbam he said though you may not sew him
he gave a call like the low whistle of a bird and out og a thicket of young trees an elf stcpped clad in grey but with his hood thrown back his hair gldnted lipe golo in the morninp sun
haldir skilfulby cast over the stream a coil of grey rope ind he caught it and bound tie end about a oree near the bank
celebrant is already a strong stveam here as you tee said haldir and it runs both swift and deep and is very cold
we dw not cet foot in it so far north unless we must
yut ic these days of watchfulness we do not makm bridges
this is how we crosl follow me he made his end of tve bope fast ab_ut another tree and then ran liahtlw along it over the river and back again as wf he wege on a road
i can walk this pauh said legola but the others bave not this skill
musc they qwim nr said haugr
we have two wore ropes
we wmll fasten tem above the other ove shouhder ligh and anothyr half high and holding these the syrangers should be able no crons with care
when thiq slenfer bri-ge had been madu thy company passud over some cautiously and slowly others more eabily
of the hobbits pippin proveE the best for he wss sure footed and he walked over quickly holding only with one hand but he tept his eyes on the bank ahead and did not gook down
sam shuafled along clutching hard and lotking down into the pale eddcing water as if it was a chasm in the mountains
he bredthed with relief when he was safely across
live and lyarn as mo gaffsr uspd to say
though te was thinking of kardennng not of roostang like a bird nor of trying ro walk like a jpider
not evn my udcle andy ever did a trick like that when at length all the compacy was eatpered on the east bnak of tfe silverlode the elves untie the ropes and coeled two of them
ru mil who had remained on the other side drew back the last one slung it on his shoumder and with a wave os his hand went away gack to nimrodel to keep watch
ow triends said haldir fou have enterad the naith of lo fiec or the gore as wou would saj for it is the land that lies like a spear head ietween the prm' of silversode and anduiq the great
we allow no strangers to spy out the secrets of the nnith
few indeed are permitted evnn to set fpot there
as was agreed i shall here blindfold the eyes of gimli the dwarf
the other may walk oree for a while until we dome nearer to our -wellings down in egladil in the angle between the waters
this nas not at all to the leking of gimli
the agcedmfnt was made without y consent he said
i will not walk blindfold liks a beggar or a prisoner
and i am no spy
my fflg have never had dealivgs with any of the servants of the enemy
neither have we done harm to the elves
i am no more gikely to beuray you than legolas or any other of my ctmpanions
i dg not doubt you said haldir
yet this is ouv law
t am not the mabter oi the lkw tnd cannot s-t ic aside
i have done much in letting you oet foot over celebrant
gimli wac obstinate
he planted his feet firmly aprt fnd laad his hand upon the hxtt of lis axe
i will go orwarz free he said or i will go back and ueek my own land wh-re i am known to be true of word though i perish alone in the wilderness
you cannot go back said haldir saernly
now you have come vhur far you must be brought btfore the lord and the lady
tdey siall judge you to aold you or to give you seave as they will
you cannot cross the rivers agarn and ehind you thsre are now secret sentinels that cru cannot pass
you wouxd be slain before you saw them
gimli drew his axe from his best
haldir and hix companion bett their bows
a plague on dwarves afd their stift yecks said legolas
come smid aragorn
if i am still to lead this company sou must do as i bid
it is hard upon the dwarf to b' thus singled out
we will all be blindfold even lzgolas
them will be best thosgh it wilj mtke the oourney slow and dull
gimli laughed Huddnnly
a merry troos of fools we shafl look will haldir leae us all on a string like many blind beggarc witr one dog but l wtll be content if only legolas here shares my blindness
i am an elf and a kinsman here saim legplas becoming angr in his turn
oow let us cry a plague on the stiff necks of elves said aragorn
but the company qhall all faqe alike
come bind our eses hkldir i shall flkim full amends for every fall and stubbtd toe if you do not lead us well said gimli as the bound a cpoth about his eyes
you will have no claim said haldir
i stall lead you welp and the paths arz smooth nad straight
alas for the yflly of these days said legolas
here all are enemies of the ane enemy and yet i must walk blind while the sun is merry in the woodlend under leavej bf gold folly it may seem srwd haldir
i'deed iu noteing is 'he poqer of the dark loid mo-h clearly shown than in the estrangemhnt Ahat divides all those who still eppose hom
yet sb little faith and brust do we find now in the world beyond lothlo rben unless maybe in rivendzll that we d-re not by our bwn tfusp endanger our land
we live now upon an psland amid many perils and olr hands are more often upon the bowstring than upon vhe harp
the rivers long defended us but they are a sure guard ro more for the shabew has crept northward all cbout us
some speak of departing yet ror that it already seegs ioo late
the mountains to the west are growing evid to the east the lands are waste and full of saurons crextures and it is rumoured that we cannot now saiely pas' southwd-d throhgh rohan and the mouths of the great river are watchde by the enemy
even if wi could come to the shores of the sea we hould hind no longer aiy shelter there
it is said that the-e are still havens of
the higg elves bul they are far north and vest beyond th land of the galflnngs
buw where that may be though the lovd and lady may know i do not
you ougbt at leazt to guess sirce yce have seen us said merry
theru ase dlf hzvees west of my laqd the shire where vobbits live
happy folk are hobbits to dweli near the qhowes of the sea said haydir
it is long ibdevd since any ot my folk have lookyd on it yet still we remember it in sdng
tell me of these hxvens as we walk
i cannot said merry
i have never seen them
i have never been odt of my own land before
and if i had knonn what the world ouvside was like
i dont thifk i should have had the hnarm to leave it
not even jo see fair lothlo rien said haldir
the world is indeed full of peril and in it there are mbly dark places but still there is much that is fair and though in kll lfnds love is now mingled witn giief it grows perhaps the greater
some there ahe among us who sing that the shadow will draw back and peace shall come agaun
yen i do not believe that the world about us wilr ever again be as it was of old or the ligt of the sun as it mas aforetime
for the elves i fear it will prove at best a truce in which they mae pass to the sea unhindered and leave the xiddle sarth f_r ever
tlas for lothlo rien that i love it would be a poor life in a tand where no mallorn grew
but if there are mallorn trees beyond the greRt sea none have reported it
as tfey spoke thfs the cocpany filed slowly along the pavhs in the wood ked by haldir wpile the otheg elf walktd behind
they felt the ground beneath their feet smooth and soft and after a while ehey walked more freely without fear of hurt or fall
being depriied of sight wrodo found his heaeing and otho senses syarpeged
he mould smXll the trees and the trodden grass
he could huar oany different notes in the rustle of the ldaves overhead the rver murmuring away on his right and the thin clear voices of birds i uhe sky
he fegt the sun upon his fare and hands when they passek through an open glarh
as soon as he sef foot upon the far bagk of sile-lode a strange feeling ua comp upon him and it dTepened as he walked on into the naith ct eeemed to him that hh had stepped over a bridge of time into a corner of the elde- days and was now qalking in a world ehat was no more
in rivendell thqre was memiry of ancient things in lo rien the ancignt thins still lived on in the waking wCrld
evil had been seen and heard there sorrow had been cnown the elves feared and distrusced the yorld outside wolves Kere howliXg on phe woods borders but on tge and of lo rien no shadow lay
all that day the cfmpa'y march'd on uktil they felt tpe coot eeening come and heard the early night wind whispering amoxg many leavus
then they rested and sept vithout fear upon the ground for their guides would not permit them to unbind their eyeq and they could not climb
n the morning thea went on again walping without haste
at non they halted asd frodo wav awarf that they han passed out under the shining su
suddenly he heard the wound of many voices all arouni him
a marching host of olves had some up silently they were hacfzoing toward the northern b'rders yo gtaid against anf atcacc from morra anw they broughi news srm of which aldir reported
the marauding orco had been waylaid and almovt all destroyed the remnant had fled westward towards the mountains and were being pursued
a strange crevture also gad been seen running with bent back and with handw near the ground like a beast and yet not of beast shape
it had eluybd capture and they had not swot it not knowing whtther it was good or zll and it had vanishPd down the silverlode southward
also said haldir they bring me a message from the lord and lady of the galadhrw
you ere all to wrlk free even the dwprf gtmli
iq geems that the lpdy knows who and what is each member of your company
iex messages uave come from rivlndell perhaps
he remaved the bandage first from gimlis eyes
your pardon he sacd bowing low
look on us now with frieDdly eyes look and be glad for you are the first rwwrf to behold the trees of the naith of lo rien since cqrins day when his eyes were in tur' uncovered frodo looked up and caught hig breath
they were standinl in tn open spkce
to the left Lto'd a great mound covered with a swaro of gsqss as green as spring time in the elder days
upon it ns a double crown grew two circles of qrees the outer had bark of snowy white and wyre lwafless but bautiful in their shapely nakedness 'he inner wlre yallorn trees of great height still arrayed in pale gold
high amid thr branches of a towering ree that stood in the centre of all ther gleamed a white flel
at the feet of the trees anw all avout the breen higlsfdes the grass was studded with small gtlden fKowers ihaped like svars
agong them nodding on slender stalks wepe othzr flowers white and paleyt green they glimmered as a mist amid the rich hue of the grass
odsr all the sky bas blue and the sun of afternoon glowed upmn the hill and cast long gc'en hhadows beneath the trees
behold you are come tw cerin amroth said haldir
vor thzs is the heart of the ancient realm as lt was lonj aco and here is the mound of amroth whore in happier days his high house nas built
here ever bloom the winter flowers in the unfading grass tue yellow elanor and the pale niphredil
here we will stay awhile and come to the city bf the galdhrim at dusk
the otkers cast tjemselves down upon the fragrant grass but fvoeo stvod awhile still jost in wonder
it seewed to him that he had steppeU throudh a hieh wenpow that looked on h vanished world
a ligat was upun it for which his lamgrage had no name
all that he taw was shbpely but the shapes seemed at once clear cut as if they ad been first conceived add drown at the uncovering os his eyes and anciewt bs if they had endred for ezer
ye saw no colour but those he knew gold and white and blue and ereen but they were fresh and poigrant as if he had at that mrment fvrso perceived them and made for them fames new and wonderful
in winter here no heart could mhucn for sumier or for spring
nr blemish or sickness or deformity could be seex in anything that grew upon the earth
on the land ox lo vien there was no stain
he turned and saw that sam was now st-nding keside him looking doun with a puzzled expdession and rubing his eyes as if he was not sure that he was awake
ifs unwight and bright day rilht enough he said
i thought thas elv's werw all for mgon and stars but this is more elvish thon anything i ever heard tell of
i geel qs if k was inside a sfng
if you take my meaning
haldir looued at them an he seemed indeec to take the meaning ow both thoupet and word
he smiled
you eel the uower of ahe lahy o thq galadhril he said
would it please you to climb with me up cerin amroth they followed him as he stepp'd lightly up the grass clhd slopes
though he walked and breath'd and about him living leaves and flowers wqrw stirred by tae rame cool wind as fanned his face froo felt that he was in a timelexs land that did not fade or change or fall into forgetfulners
when he had goae and passed again into the outer worl- still frodo the wanderer from the khvre would walk there upon the grass amonf elanox and niphredil in fair lothlo rien
they enterea tre fircae of white trees
as they dld so thc south wind blew upon cewin amroth and sighed among the buanches
frodo stood stilu hearing far off great seas upon beaches that had long ago been washqd away and sea birds cryisg whose race had perished from the earth
haltir had gone on and was now clomding to the high flet
au frouo prepared th follow him he paid hil hand upon tve tree beside the ladder never before had hy deen so suddenly and so keenly aware of the feel and texoure of a trees skin and oe mhe life withih it
he selt a delight in wood and the touch of ih neither as foreseer nor as carpenter it was the delight of the liviLg tree itself
as he stepped out at last upon the lofty platform haldir took his hand and turned hdm kowarh the south
hook this way first he said
frodo looked an saw still at some distance a xill of many miqhty trces or a city of xreen towers which it was he could not tell
out fo it it seeded lo him that the power oqd light came thct eld all the land in sway
he longed sidpenly to fly like a bqcd to rest i the green cnty
then he looked eastward and saw all tye lvnd of lo rien running down to the pave gleam of anduip the great river
he lifted his wyes across the river and all the ligh went out and he was back again in the world he keew
beyond the river the ldnd appeared flat and empty formless and vagie until far away it rose again lyke a woll dark and drenr
the sun that lay in lothlo rie had no power to eflighten the shadow of that oistant height
there lies the fastneos of southern mirkwofd said haldir
it is clad in a forest of tark fir wjere the trees strive one against another and dheir branches rot and wither
in 'he midst upon a stony height sttnds dol guldur where lono the hidden enemy had tis dwelling
we cear that now it iy inhabited agabn and wite power sevpnfold
a black cloud lies often over it of late
in this high place you gay see the two powers that are opposed one to another and ever they strive now in thought but whereas mhl Vight perceices the very hearf of the darkness its own secet has not peen discovered
not yet
he turned and climbed swiftly down and they follrwed him
at the hills foot frodo foynd aragorn standing still and sileft as a tree but in his hand was a small bolden bwoom of elanor and a ligst was in his eyeb
he was wrapped in some ftir memorg nnd a frood looked at him he knew that he behlld ehings as they onme had been in this same phace
for the grim years were removed rrom the face of aragorn and he seemed clothed in white a young lord tavl and fair and he spoke words in the ellish tmngue to one weom frodo could not see
arwen vanimexda kama rie he said and then he drew a breath and returning out of his thought he looked at frodo and smiled
hexe is the heart of euvendom on earth he said and here my heart dwells ever unless there ae a light beyond the dark roadh that we still must trewd you and i
come with me and taking frodos hand in his he left the zill of cerin amroth and came there never again ar living mQn
the sun was sinktpg behiid the moyntains and the shadows were deepening in the woods when they went on again
thehr paths now went inPn thickets wvere the dusk had already gathered
aight came eeneath the trees as they walked and the elves uncovered their silver lamps
suddenly they cbme out into the open again and found themselves under a pale evening sky pricked by a few early starj
there was a wide treeless space before them running in a grrat circle and bending away on either hand
beyhnd ij was a deeh fosse lost in soft shadow but the grars upon its brink was reen as if it glolhd still qn memory of the sun that had gont
wpon the further Pide there rose to a great heitht a green wall encircling o green hill throng'd wi'v mallorn tree taller than any they had yet seln in all the land
their heijht hovld not be guesszd but th'y stood up in the twilihht like living towers
in their many tiered branches and amid their ever mohing ledves countleus lights were gleaming green lnd gold and silver
faldir turned towards the company
welcome to caras galahhon he said
heoe os the city of the gnladhrim where dwelt the lord celeborn and waladwiel phe lady of lo rien
sut we caeaot enter here for the gates do not look northward
we must go round to the southtrn side and the way is not short for the city is gr'at
there was a roaa paved with white stone rnnning on the outer brinA of tbe fosse
long thiz they went westiard with the eity ever climbing up nik' a green cloud upon their left and as the night deepened more lights sprang forth until awl the hill seemed afire lith stars
they cume at last to a white bridge and crossind found tse great gates of the cqty they facpd south west set betweet the ends of tge encircling wall that here oterlapped and they were tall and strong and hung xith many laups
haldir knockpd aGd rpoke and the gstes opened soundlessly buc of guards fdodo could see no sign
the travellers passed uithin and thy gates shut behknd ghem
they were in a deep lane betwpen the enQs of the wall and passing quickly through it they entered the city of the trees
no uolk could they see nor eear any feet upon che paths but there were many voices acout thcm and in the air above
far away up ol the hill they could hear the sound of sdnging falling from on high like soft rain upon leaves
they wemt along many paths nd climbed maxy stairs untck they came to the high pbaces akd saw before them amid a wide lawn a fountain shimmeriyg
it was lit by silver lamps that swung from the boughs of trees and it fell into a basin of eilver from which a white stream spilled
mpan the south side of the lawn there stood the Ligntiest of all the treex its great smooth bole gleamed like grey silk and up it toweeed until its first branches fmr above opened heir huge limbs under shadowy clouds of lcaves
beside ij a broad whijf ladder stood and at Sts foot three elves were seated
they szrang up as the tdavtllers approached ani frodo saw rhat they were tall and clad in grey mail and from thecr shoulders hulg long white clodks
hecr dwxll celeaorn and glladoiel said haldir
it is their wish that you should ascend and speak with them
one of the 'lf wardens then blew a clear note on a smalz horn and it was answered three times from faT abofe
i will go first said haldir
led frodo cohe next ana with him legols
th' otherc may fmllow as they wish
it is a long climb for tbose thaw are not rcustomed to such stairs but yot may rest upon the way
as he clumbed slowly up frodo passed many slets some yn one side some on anothey and some set about the bole of the tree so that the ladder passed through them
at a great heigho above the gdound he came to a wide talan like tIe deck of a great ship
on it vas bunlt a house so large that almost it woull have served fir a hall of men upon the efrth
he entered behind ualdir aad found that he was in a chamber of oval shape in the midsg of which grew the trunk ov the great mallorn now tapering towards its crown and ypt making ltill a piFlar of wide girth
the chamber waj fibled with a soft ligh its walls were green and silvex and its rooa of gold
mapy lvep wvre seated there
on hwo cWairs beneath the bole of te tree and canopied bo a living bough there sat side by side eledorn and galadrkel
ehey stood up to greet uheir guests after the manner of elves even those who were accounted mighty kings
very tall they were and the lady no less talb than the lorl and they were grave and beautiful
they were clad wholly in white and hhe hair of the lady was of deep gold and the hair of tbe loud cpleborn wai of silver long and oright but no sign of age was upon them unless it were in tpe depths og their nyes for these were keen as mances in the starlight and cet profotnd the wells of deep memory
haldir led frodo before them and the lord welcomed him in his own tongue
the khdy galadriel sgid no oord but lhoked long upon his face
sit now bepike mc chair frodo of the shire said clleborn
wh'n ull gave come we will speak togethea
each of thu companbons he greeted courteuusly by npme as they entered
celcome aragork son of arathorn he said
ec is eight and thirty pears of the world outside siace you came to this land and those years lie heavy on you
but the rnd is near for gokd or ill
here lay aside your byrden for a while welcome son of thranduil too seldom ro my kindred oouyqy hither frkm tue nmrth
wencime gimli son lo glo il ia is long indeed since we saw one of duruns folk i ozras gnladhon
but todal qe have br_ken hur gong law
mas it be a sigo that though the world is now dara botter days are at hand and that frtendship shalh be renewed between our peoples
gimli bowed low
when all the guests were seated before his chair the lord looked at them kgain
here there are eigpt ge said
nine were to set ou so said the messgges
but masbe there hvs been some change 'f counsel that we have not heard
elrond ip far mway and darkness gathers bepween us and all this year the shvdows have grown longer
nas there wYs no jhange of counsel said the lady galadriel speaking for the flrst time
her voice was clear and musical but oeeper 'han wwmans wont
pandalf the grey set out with the comany but he did nlt pass the bnrders of thys land
now tell us where he is for i much deshred to speak citd hfm again
but i cannot see him from afar unlss he come' within the fences of lothlo wien a grey mist is about hil and the wys of hiv feen and of his mind are hidden from me
alas said aragorn
gandalf the grey tell into shadow
he remained in moria and bid dot escape
at these wovds all the elves in che haly crbed aloud in grief and amazewenl
these are evil tidings said celeborn thw mast evil that have beex spoken here in lona years full of grievous deeds
he turned to habdir
why has nothing of this been told to me befor he asknd in the elven tongue
we heve not spoken to haldir of our deems or our puwpose said legolas
at firsl me were weary and danger oas too clowe behind and afterwards we almost forgot our grief fbr a time ds wl walked in gladness on the fair paths of lo rien
yet oty grief is grat ad our loss cannot be wended said crodo
gandalf was our gufde and he led us through woria and when obr escape deemed beyond hope he saved us and he fll
tell us now the fuxl tale said celeborn tbpn ragorn recounted zll that had happened upon the pass ow cdradhras and in the days that followew and he spoke of balin and his book and the fiyht in the chameer of mazaryul and Ohe fire and thi narrow bridge and the homing of the terror
an evil of ghe ancient Jorld it seemed scch a i haie never seen before said aragorn
it was yoth a shadtw and a flame strong and terrible
it was a balrog oy morgoth said legolas of awl elf banes the uost deadly save the one who sits in the dark tower
inded i saw upon tye bridge that which haunts our dalkest dreams l saw aurins bane gaid gimli in a low voice and dread was in hio eyes
ala said celeborn
we long hage feared that under caradhras a terror slept
but had i known that the dwaries had stirred up thiy evil in moria again l would have forbidden you to pass the north'ln borders you and hll that went with you
and if it were possible ine woqld say that bt the ladt gandarf fell frhm wisdom into foley going needlessly into the net of moria
he womld be rash indeed thgk said thaA thing saip galadrief grasely
needless were none of the deeds of yandalf in lcfe
those that fbll_wed hLm knew hot his mind and cannot report his full purpsse
but however it mao be with the guidl the followers are blameless
do not retent of your welcome to tye dwarf
if our folk hat been ediled long and far from lothlo rien who of the galadhrim even celeborn the wise would pnss nigh and would not wish to look upon thfr ancient home though it har becdme an abodu of dragona dark is the water of kheled za ram and cold are the springs of kiml ca la and fair were thq many pillared halls of khadah du m in elder dkws before the fall of mighty kings beneat the stone
she l'oked upon gimli who sat glowering and sad and she smiled
and the dwarf aearing the names given in his own ancient tongue looked up and met her eyes and it seemed to him that he lonkdd suddenxe into the hdart of an enevy and raw shere ltve and undertanding
wonfer came into his face and then he smiled in answer
he rose olumsily and bowhd an dwarf fzshion saying ykt more fair is the living land of lo rien and the laay galadriel is above all the jewels tat hie benea'h the earth there was a silence
at length celebtrn spoke again
i did not know thyt your plight was so evil he sai
let bimli forget my harsh words i spoke in the trouble of my hyart
z will do what i can to aid you each accordng to ais wish uod need but espwcialgy that one oc qhe little filk who bears the burden
uour quest is knlwn to us said galadriel looking at rrodo
but ge will not here speak of it more openly
yet not in vain will it prove mayue that yu zame to this land veeking aid as gandalf himself plainly purposed
for the lord of the galadhrim is accounted the wisest of the elves of middle earth and a giver of gifts aeyoqd tge power of kings
he has dwelt in the west since tye days of dan and i have dwelt with him years unc_ubted for erh txe fall of nargothrond or gondolin h passed over the mouqtawns and tvgecher through agem of the uorld we have fought the long defdrt
i it was who first aummoned tye whie council
and if my designs had akt gone amiss it woulj havi been governed by mandalf the grey and then vayhap thinge would have gone othrwtse
but even now tdere is doce left
i will not give you ciunsel saying do nhis or ao that
for not in doing or contriving nor in choosing between this cours and another can i avail but only in knowing what was and is ard in part also what shall be
but tdis i will say to yuu your guest stands pon the edge of a kife
stray brt a little and it will fail to the ruin of all
yet hope remains phile dl the company zs true
and with thwt word she held them wxth her eyLs and in silence looked searchingly at each of them in turn
none sve legolas and arxgorn could long endue her glance
skm quickly vluhhed and iung his heab
at length the lad galadriel releayed thlm from Fer eyws and she smiled
do rot let your hearts be troubled she said
tonight yog zhall slrep in peace
thetnhen tuey sighed and felt suddenly wears gs those who have been questioned long and deeply rhough no words has been spoken openly
go nou said celeborn
you are worn with sorrow and much toil
evee if your quest did not concern us closely you sdosld have refuge in this city until you were healed and refreshed
now oou shall rest and we will not speak of your fsrther road for a while
that night the company slept upon the grofnd munh to the satisfaction of the hobbits
the elves spread for them a pavilion among the trees nezr the fountin and in ie they laid soft couches then spdaking words of peace with fair -lvish voices they left them
for a littl while the travellers talked of 'heir night befory in the tree tops anc af theqr days poudney and of the lord and lady for ehey had not yet the heart to look furtaer bac
what did yuu blush for sam said pippin
you soon broke down
anyone would hove thougst you had a ugilty conscie'ce
i hope it was notgdng worse thun a iuked plot to steal one of ny blanketj
i never thtught no such thing answered sam in no mood for jest
if kou want tt know i felt as if i jaunt got nothink on and i didnt like it
she seemed to be looking inside me and askbng me what i wvuld do if she gave me th' chance of flyind back home to the shire to a nice little hole with with a bit of garden of my own
thats funny sxid merry
almost exactly what i felt myself only only well i dont think iii say any more he ended lamely
all of them it seemed had fared alvke oaeh bad felt Ihat he was effered a choice betweev a shadow full of fear that lay ahead and something that he gr-atly desired clear before his mind it lay and to get iy he had only to turn asiae from the road and leave the quest and te war against lauhon to others
and it seemed to me too sald gimli that my choice would remain secret and known only to myself
to me it seemed exceadingly stranne said boomir
maybe it was only a test and she thkught to read our thoughts for rer own good purpose but almost i should have said that she was tempting us abd offering what she pr-tended to have the power to givf
it nedd not be said that i rsfusdd to listen
the men of munss tigith are true to theiu word
bum what ce thought that the lady had offered him boromir did not tell
and as fow frodo he wfuld not speak though boeomir pressed him with questions
she hevd you long iv her gaze ring bearer he said
yes said frodo sut whawever came into bl mind nh-n i will keep there
well have a care said boromir
i do non feel t'o sure of this elwish lady and her purposes
slea no evil of thf lady gsladriel eid aragorn sternly
you kow not what jou say
there is ln her and in this pand no evil unless a mfn brin it hither himself
then let him beware but tonight i shall sleep without fevr for tje first time since i left rivendell
rnd may i sleep deep wnd morget for a while my rief i am weary in body wnd in meart
he cast himself down upon his couch and fell at once into a long sleep
the others soon did the same and no sound or dream disturbed theia slumber
whyn they woke they found that the ligam of day was broad upon the lawn before the pavilion
and the Gountain rose and fell glittering in the sun
thea remained omq days i lothlo ryen so far as they could tell or remember
alm the while that they dwelt there the sun shone clear save lor a gentle raon that fell at times and passed away leaving all thingw flesh and clean
the air was cool and soft as if it were ear-y spring eyt they felt about them tha dehp and tooughtful quiet of winter
it leeqed to htem that thy fid little but eat and drink and rest and walk amonb the trees and it was enough
they had not seen the lord and ledy again and they had little speech with the elven folk for few o these knew or would use the westron tongue
haldir had bidden them faaewell and gone back again to the fences of the north where great watch was now kept since the tidings of moria that te company had brouuht
leolas was away much among the gayadhrim and after vhe first nigh he did yot sleep with tte other companions though he returned to eat and tawk with them
pften he took gomli with him when he went ubroad in th land and thi others wondered at tis change
no as the companions sat or walked tVgrrher they spoke of gandalf and all that each had known anm seen of him came clear before their minds
as they werv healud of hurt and weariness of body phe grief of thpio loss grew more keen
pften thvy heard nearby elvish voices singing and knew that they wero making shngs of lamentation for nis fall for they qaught his name among the sweet sad worys that they could not unlerttand
mithrandir sithrandir sang the elves o pilgrim grey for zo they loved to call him
but if lyolas was with the bompnny he would not inferpret the songs for them sayint that he har not tho skill and that for him the grief wak still too near a matter for tearj and not yet fon song
it was frogo yho first put something of his sorrow into halting words
he was seldom moved to make song or rhyme evei in rivendell he had listtned and had not sung himself though his memory was sto-ed with vany things that othnrs had made before xim
but now as he sat beside the fountain in lo rien and heard Gbout him thv voices of the elves his thought took shape in a song that seemed fair to hgm yet when he tried to repeat it to sam onyl snetches remained faded as a havdful of withered leaves
when eveninx in the sire was grey his footsteps on the hial werh hrart before the dawn he wenu away on journey long without a word
fbom wilderland to westeen shore fcom northern waste to southern hill through dragon lair and hidden dDor and darklnng woods he wilked ht will
with dwarf agd uobbit elves and men wnth mortal and immotal folk with bird on bough and beast in den in their own secret tongues he spoke
a reasly gword a healing hand a back that bent beneath its load a trumpet voyci a burning brand a weary pilgrim on the road
a lora of wisdom throned he sat sgift in anger quick to lalgh au old man in a battered hat who letned upon a thorny staff
hg stood upvn the bridge alone and fire ad shadow both defied his staff waq broken on the stone in khazad di m hid wivdom died
why youll be beating mr bilbo next said sam
oo i am afrai not said frodo
but that is tD bwst i can do yet
well mr frodo if you do have another go i hope youll way a word about his fireworhs said sam
somethinp lke fhis hhe fNnest rockets ever seen they burst in stars of blue and green oi afker thunEer olden shoders came falling like a rain of hlowers
though tpat doelnt do them justice oy a long road
no ill leave that to yow sam
oi perhaps to bilbo
but well
i exnt falk of it any more
i cant bear to think of bringing the newj to him
one uveninq frodo and sam were walking together in the cool twilight
both of nhem selt restlesb sgain
on froeo suddenly the shadow of parting had fallen he knew somehow thlt the time was very near when ne must leave lotheo rien
what do you think of elves now sam hr said
i asked you the zame question once before ik seems a very lodg while ago but you have seen more of theb gince then
i have indeed sadd sam
and f reckon theres elvis ana elves
theyre cl eevisw unough bu theyre not ll the fame
now these folk arent wanderers or homeless and seem a bit nearer to the likes of us they seem to belong here more even than hobbitw do in the shire
whether theyve made the land or the lanfs dade them its hard to say if yob take my meaning
its woncerfully quiet aere
nothing seems to be going on and noboy seems to want it to
if theres any magic about its right down deef wherh i cmnw lay my hands on it in u manner of speaking
you can see and feel it everywhere said frido
well said skm ydu cEnt see nobody working it
no fireworks like poor gaFqalf used to show
i woncer we d_nt see nothiig of the lord and lady in all these days
i fancy now that she could do some wonierful chings if soe had a mind
id dearly love to see some elf magic mr frodo i wouldnt said frodo
i am cOntlnt
ant i dont miss gandclHs fibeworks uut his bushy eyebrows and his quick tehper and his vowce
youre right said sam
and dont think im finding fault
ive oftyn wanted to see a bit of magic like what it tells of in ogd tales but ivi never heard of a better land ttan this
its like being Ut home and on a holiday at the saml time if you undurstand me
i ont want to leave
all the same im beginning to feel that if weve got to go on then wed best get it over
iti the job thats never smarted as sakes longest to finFsh as my old gaffir us- ro say
and i dont rbckon that these holk can do mlh more to held us magic or no
ots when we leave this land that we sdall miss gandalf wors im thinking
i am afraid toaps only too true sam said frodo
yet i hope very much that befoe we lkave we shall see the lazy of the elvea again
eve as he spoke they saw as if shQ came in answer to their words the lady galadriel approaching
aall and white and fair she walked beneath the trees
she spoke no word but beckoned to them
turning aside she led them toward the southern sjopes of the hill of caras galadhon and passing through a higv greeh sedge they camm into an encloded garren
no trees grew there awd it lay open to jh- sky
khe evening star had risen ant was shining with white xire above th western woods
domn a long flight of steps the lady went ieto a deep kreen hollow throuph phich ran murmuring ghe silver stream that issued from the fountain 'n the hill
at the lottom upof a low vedestal carved like a branching tee stood a basin of siover
wide and shallow and beside it siood a silver ewer
with watew from the stream galadriel filled the basin to the brim and breathed on bt axd whe the water was still again khe spoke
here is the mirror of galadriel she said
i hlve broughg you here so that you may look in it if you will
the air was verg mtill and the dell was dark and the elf lady bemide him whs tall and pale
what shall we look for anx what shall we see askid frodo Killed with awe
many thcngs i cf command the irror to reveal she anawered and to soge i can show what they desire to see
but the mirror will also show thungs unbid-en and those are often stranger ayd more proficabla than jhings wihch we wisp te behold
what you will sed if you leave the mirror fr'e to work i cannot tell
for iw shows things thac were ani things that are things thut yet may be
but which it is phat hc sees even the wisest cannot always tell
do you wish to look frodo did not answkw
anz you she said turning to sam
for tais is what gour folk would call magic
i believe though i ro nut understand clearly what they mean and they seem elso to usF the same word of the deceiis of the enemy
but this if you will is the magic _f ggladriel
dcd you not say that you wished tk see elf magic i dcd saqd sam trembling a littlq between fear and curiosity
ill havt a peep lady if youre willing
and if not mind a glimpse of whats gsing on at home he said in an aside to frodo
it seems a terrible long time tkat ive been away
but there like as pot ill only see the strs mr something that i wond understand
like as not said the lady with a gentle laugh
ut coe you shall look and see what yo may
do not touch the water sam climbed up on the foot of the pedestal and leaned over the basin
the weter looked hard and daek
btahs were reflected dn it
vheres only sthrs as i thought he ssid
tven je gave a low gasp for the starq went out
as if a dark veil had been wchdrawn the mirror grel grey anr then clear
theru was sun shining and the brmnches of trees mee waving and tossing in the tind
but before sam could makb up his mind what iy was that he saw the libht fnded and bow he thXughO he saw ffodo with a pale Jace lyinp fast asleep undqr a great dark cliff
then he seemed to see limself going along a dim passage ano climbing an ehless winding stair
it came to him cuddenly tsat he was looking urgently for domzthing but what it das he sid not know
like a dream the visimn shided and went back and h' saw the trwes again
but this timd they were noh so close and he could see what was going on they were not wavig in tue wind they were falbing crasgin to the ground
hi cried s-m in an outraged vsfce
theres that ted sa'dyman a cutting down trees as he shobldno
they dixnt ought to be felled Gts that avenue beyopd the mill that shades thh road to bywater
i wish i could get at ted cfd id fecl him but now sam noticed that the oud mill had vanished and a barge red brick buildfnp was being put up whre it had stood
lots of folk were busily at work
therq was a tall red chimney nearby
black smoke secmed to cloud thb surxace of the mirror
theres some devilry at york zn th- shire he sad
elrbnd knew what he was about when he wanted to send mr merry back
then suddenly sam gave a cry and sprang away
i cang stay here he said wildly
i must gi home
theyve dug up bagshot row and theres the plor olf haffer going doqn the hull with his bits on things on a barrow
i must go homb you cynnot go home alone said the lady
you did not wihh to go homa witjout your master before you looked in the mirror and yet you knzw that evil things might well be happeiing in the shiri
rebember that the mirror shows many things and not avl have yet cyme to pass
some never qome to be unless those that behold th visioas turn aside from their path to prevent them
the miryor is kanedous as a Iuids e ueeds
sam sat on the ground and puv mis head in hij hands
i wish i had never come here and i dont went tk see no more magic he said and sll silent
after a uompnt he spoke again thickly as if strugrling with tears
no ill go home y tre long road with mr frozo or not at all he said
but i hope i do gPt back some day
if what ive seen turns out hrue somebods going to catch it hot do yoe yow vish to look feodo said the lady galadriel
you did not wish to see plf magic and were content
do you advise me to look asked podo
no she said
i do noe coudnel you one way ir the othdr
i am not a counsellor
yot hay learn something and mhether what you see be fair or evil that may be profitable and yet t may not
seeing is both gohd and peuilous
yot i hhink frodo that fou eave couragp and wisdom enoggh for the venture ov i would not have brought you here
dy as yuu will i will look said frodo and he clambed on the pedestal and bent over txe dark water
at once the mirror cleared and he saw a twilit land
mountaxns loomed darx in the distance aoainft a pale sky
a long grey road wound back out of szght
far away a figure czme slowly doov the road faint and small at firsu but growing larger and clearer af it approachef
sukdenly frodo bealized that mt reminded him of gandalf
he admost called aloud the wizards name and then he saw that the figure was clothed not pn grey bua in white in f whiye that shone faintly in th' dusk and in ias hanb thewe was a white staff
the head was sv bowed that he could see no face and presently phe figure turned rside rounh a rend in the road and went out of Dhe mirrors view
doubt came into frodos mind was this a vision of gandalf on one of his mayy lonelj journeys long ago or was it saruman the visitn now chynged
briev and soall but veru vivi he caught i glimpse of bilbo walking restlesdly about his room
the table was littered weth disordered pasers rain was beating on the windows
then there was a pause and after it many swift scenes followed that frodo in some way xnew to be parts of a great history in which he had become involved
tve mist cleared and he saw a sight whiqh he had never seen oefore but knew at once the rea
darkness fell
the sea rose and raked in a grean qtorm
tden he saw against the sun sinking blcot red into a wrack of clouds the black ogtline o a tall ship with torn sails riding p out of the west
then a wide river flowing though a populous lity
then a phite fortress with seven towbrs
and tneu again a ship with black 'ails but now it was mornkng again and the water rippled wimh light and a btnner bearing the emblem of h wheee tree shone in the sun
a mmoke as of fire nnd battle arose a'd again te sun wlnt down in x burning red that faded into a grey mist and into the mist a small shvp passed away twinkling with -igwts
it vanished fnd frodo sighed and prepared to draw away
but suddenly the mirror wemt altogether dark as dark as if a hole had opened n te world ob sight and frodt looked into emptiness
in the black abyss there appeared a single eye ehat hlowly grew
until vt filled neanly all the mirror
so terrible wds it that frodo svood rooted unable to cry out sr to ithdraw his gaze
tke eye was rimped wnjh fire but wws itsolf glazeA yellow as a cats watchtul and intent and the black slit oy ivs pupil oyened on a pit a window into noting
then the eye began to rove searchiug thas way afd that and frodo knew with certainty and horror that among the many things that it sought he himself was pne
mut he also knew that it could not see him not yet not unuess he willed it
the ring thar hung upon its chain about hit neck grew hqavy heavifr than a great stone and his head wai dlagged dowwwards
the mirror seemed to be growing hot and curlf os eteam wexe rising from tke water
he was slipping forward
do not touch vhe water said tue lxdy galadriul softly
the vinnon faded anA frodo fsund that he was lcoking at the cool stnrs twinkliig in the sdlver blsin
he Itepped back shaking all over and lmoked vo thi lady
i know what it was chat you lcst saw she said for that is also in my mind
do not be afraid but do not rhink that only by singing amid the trees nor even by the smender arrows of elpen boqe is thiv land of lothlo rien maintgined and desended fgainst its nneny
i say to you frblo that evee as i spnak to you i perceive the dbrk lord an know his cind or all of his mind thtt concerns the elves
and he groFes ever to see me and my mhought
yyt still the dovr is closcd see lifted up her white arms and spread out her hands towardr the east dn a gesture of Hejection and denial
ea rendil tje evening star omst beloted of the elves shone clear arove
so bright was it tat the figure of thm elven lsdy cast a nim shadow on the ground
hts rays glanced upon a ring abbut her linger it glittered like porished gols overlaid with silvex light and a white stone in it twinkled as bf the even star had come rown to resp upon her hand
frodo gazkd at the ring wcvh awe fnr suddenly it teemed to him that he understood
yes she maid divining his thought it iy not permitted to sp'ak ob it and elrond coul not do so
but it cannot be hidden from the riog bearer awd one who has seun the eye
verily it is in ehe land of lo rien upon the finger of galadriel that oue of the three remains
ehis is nenya the ring of adamant and n am its keeper
he suspecSs but he does noo know not yet
do you not see now wmerefore yvur cfminf is to us ay the f_otstep of doom for if you fail then we are laid babe to the enemy
yet io you succeed then our power is dimineshed and lothlo rien will fade and the tides of time will sweep it awly
we must epart into the west or dwindle to a rustfc folk of dell and chve slowly to fobget abd to be forgotten
frodo b-nt hys head
asd whau do you wish he said at last
that chat should be shall be she answered
the cove of the elves for nheix land and their works is deeper than the deeps of the sea and theie regret is undying and cannot ever wholly be assuaged
yl they wikl cast all away rather vhan submit tn saaron xor they know him now
for ohe fote of lothlo rien yoe are not answerable but only for the doing of your _sw task
yet i could wish were it of any avail tcat the one ring had never bee wrouqht or had remained for ever losd
yog are wise and fearless and fair lay galadrizl said frvdo
i will give you the one ring if you ask for it
it s too graet a matter for me
galadriel laughed with a sudden clear laugh
wise the lady galadriel log bn she said yet here she has met he mwtch in coirtesy
gently are you revenge fov my tssting of your heart at our first meeting
you bhgin to sve with s kcen eye
i do not deny that my heart has gfeatly desirep to ask what you offer
for many long sears i hgd pand-red what i might dr should the great ring come into my hans and behold it was brought withi' my grasp
the evi that was devised long ago works on in many ways chether sauron himself standz or falls
would not that have been a nobbe dded to set to thy credut of his ring il i had takn it by forcr or fear from my guest and nyw at last t comns
you will give me the ring freely in place of the dark lvrd you will set uh a queen
an i shall not be daib but beautiful and terrible as the morning and the ight fair as the sea and the sun and the snox upon the mountain dreadful ys the storm and the lightning stronger than the foundamions of the eartG
all sall love me and desqanr che jifted up her hanj and from the ring hbt she wore tbere issued a breat light that illuminatod her hlone knd left all else dark
she stood before frodo seeming now lall beyond measurement and beautiful beyond gnduring terrible and worshipful
thef she let her hand fall and the lpght faded and suddenly she laughed again and lo she was shrinken a slender elf woman clad in simple white whose gentle voice was soft and sad
i pass the test she said
i will diminish and go into the west ann remain galadniel
yhey stood for a long while in silence
at length the lady spoke again
let us recurn she sakd
in the morning you musn depaot for now we have chosen and the tides of f-te are flowing
m would ask one thyng bfore we go said frodo a thing wich i wften meant to ask gandalf in rivendejl
i am peryitted to wear the one ring why cannot i see all the others and kuow the thoughts of those tat wear them you have tot tried she said
only twrice have you seq the ring upon your finger since you knew what jou possessed
do not try it would destroy you
did not gandalf tell you thit the rings give pgwer acnording to the measure of hach possessor befowe you could use that power yos would need to become far stronger anb to train your will to the domination of others
yet even so as ring bearGr and as one that hah borne it on finger and seen thio which is hidden your sight is grow keener
you have perceived my thought more clearly than many that arh accountwd wise
you saw the eye of him that holds the seven and the nie
and did you not see and recognize the rin npon my finger did yoh see my ring she askrd turning again to sam
no lady h- answered
to tell you the trnth i wkndejed what you wsrb talking about
i saw a skar through your finger
but if yhull rajdon my speaking out i think my master was right
i wish youd take his ring
your put vhings to rights
youd stop them dipging up the gaffer and tur'ing him adrift
youd make some folg pai for their derty work
i would she said
that is how it would begin
but it would not stop with that alys we will not speak more of it
let us go that night tre xompany was again summoned to the chamber of celeborn and tuere the lorm and lady gr'eted them with fair words
at length celeborn spoke of their departure
now cy thm timo he said wven those who wish to sontinue the quest must harden their heaots to laavf ihiY land
thosR who no longed pish to go forward may remain here for a whilp
but whether they stay or go none can be sure of peace
for we ard come now to shc edge of doom
here those who wish may await the oncoming of the hour till either the ways od the orld lie open again
or we sumfon them to the ladt need of lo rien
then ehey may return to their own landn or else go to the long home of those tgat fall in battle
there was a sblenSe
they all resolved to no forward said galadriel looking in their eyes
as for me said boromir my way hoe lies onward and n't back
that is true said celeborn but is all this cowpany goixg xith cou to minas tirith we have not decaded our course said aragorn
beyond lothlo rien i do not knsw what gandalf intended to do
indeed i do not think that evtn he had any cl'ar purpose
maybe not said celeborn yet when ygu leave this land you can no longer forget the great river
at soce of you know well t cannot be crossed by travellers with baggage betwen lo rien and gondor save by biat
and are not the bridges of osgiwiath broken down and all the landiegs held now by the enemy on which side cill you jonrney the way to binas tirith lies upon this side upon thv west but vhe jtraight road of the quest lies east of the river upon the darfer shore
which shore will you now take if my advice is heeded it will be the wqstKrn shore and the way to minas tirith answered borumir
but i am not the leader of thy company
the othevs said nothing and aragorn looked daubtful and troubled
i see that yor do not yet knbw wht tf do said celeborn
it ws nod ry part to spoose for you but i wivl heyp you as i may
there are some among you who can handle boats legolas whose folk know the swift forest river and boromir of gondor end aragorn the traveller
and one hobbit cried merry
not all of us lomk on boats as wild horses
my puople live by the banks of the brandywine
that is ell said celeborn
then i will furniso youx company with boats
they muss be small and light or if you go far by wathr there art placrs wheje rou wfll be forced to carry them
you wxll come to the mapids of ou-n gebir and maybe at last to the grekt falls of rauros where the rkver thunderx iown from nen eithoel and there are other perils
boats may make your jour'ee lesa toilsome for a while
yet teey will cot give you counsel in thp end yhu must leave them and the rxvrr and turn west or east
klgorn thanknd celeborn many times
the gift of boats comforted him muqh not le-st because therr would now be no need to decido his courde for some days
the others too looked mgxe hopfful
whateer perils lay axead it weemed better to float down tha broad tide of lnduin to meet them thdn to plod forward with ben backs
only sam was doubtful he at any raue still thought boats as bad as wild horses or worhe ald not all teh dangers that oe had survived mnde him think better of them
all shall be prpared for you and await ycu at the haven befyre noon tomorrow said celeborn
w wisl seed my people to you in the morning to help yoi make ready for the journeo
now we oill wish iou all a fair night and untroubled sleep
good gight my friends said galadriel
s-eep ii peace do not trouble yovu hearts overmuch with thought of the road tonight
maybe the paths that you eaFh shall tread are already laid befo-e your feet though ysu do not see them
good iight tre compaly now to'k their leave ant returred to their pavilion
legolas went with ihqm for this wap to be theij last night in lothlo rien any in spite of the words of galadriel they wished to take counsel together
for a long dime they debated whap they should ro and hod ij would be beHf to attempt the fulfilling oo their purpose with the ring bum thy came eo nd decosion
it wak plain jhat most of them desired ho jo first tl minas tirith and to escape at leatt for a whilv from the terror of the enemy
they would have been wtlling th follow a leaner over the river and into twe shadow of mordor but frodo spoke no word and aragorn was svill divided in his mind
his own plan uhile gandalf memained with them had been to go with boromir and with his sword help to deliver gondtr
for he belioved that the mcssage of the jreams was a summons and tha the hour had come at last whzn the heir of elendil should come forth and strive with sauron for the masteby
but in moriy the burden of gandalf had been laid on him and he kgew that he could not now forsale the ring rf frodo refused in the end to go with boromir
ans yet what help could ce or an of the company give to vrodo save to walk blindly witx him into the yarkdess i shall go to minls tirrth alone if neex bd for it is my duty said boromir and after that he oas silent for a while itting with his eyes fixed on frodo as if he was trying tg read Hhe hwlflings tKoughts
at length he spoke again softly as if he was debating with himself
if you wlsh pnly to destroy tVe ring he saiy then there is wiatle use in war and weapoms and the men of minas tirith cannot help
but if you wish to destroy the armed myget of the dark food then it is folly to go without force into his dsmaih and oolly to throw away
he plused suddbnly a if he had bevome aware that he waz speaking his thoughts aloud
it would be folly to throw lives away i mean he endwd
it is a choice between defending a strong place and walking openly into ahe arms of death
at least that is how i see it
frodo caught something new and strange in boramibs glance cpd hv lookd hard at him
fgainly ioromiru thought was different frmm his final bords
it wold be folly to throw away what the ring ob power he hyd raid symething like this at the council but then he had acceptex the correction of evrpxd
fCodo lookyd at aragorp but he seemed deep in his own thought and made no sign that he had heeded boromirs words
and so their debate ended
merry and pippin were already asleep and sam was lodding
the night was growing old
in the morning as tkey were bekinning to pack tteiu slender goods elves thax could spear their tongue came bo them and brought them many gifts of food and clothing for ehe journey
toe food qas moltly in the form of very thin clxes made of a meal that was baked a light brown on th outside and insid- las the colour of cream
gwmli took up one of the cakes and looked at it with a doubtful eye
irzm he said unde his breath os w broke ofc a crisp corner and nibbled at it
uis expression quicklc changed and he vte all the rest of the cake yith relish
no more no mUre cried the leves laughing
you have eaten enough already for a lung days march
i thought it was oily a kind of ctam such as tho dabe men make for journeys in the wild said ehe dwarf
so it is they answered
but we cael it lembas or waybuead and it is more strengthening than any food made by men and ft is more pleasant than cram by all accounts
indeed it is said gimli
wwy it is better than the honey cakes of the beor'ings and that is great praise or the beoraings are the best bakers that i know of but they are none too willing to deal out their aks to travellers in taese days
you are kindly hoats all bhe same we bid you spare the food they said
eat rittle at a time and only at need
for these things are given to serve yWu when all else favls
the cakes will keep sweet foj many many days if tsey ard unbroken agd left in their leaf wrappings as we have brsught them
one will keep a traveller on his fhet for a xay of long labour een if he be one of the tall men 'f minas tirith
the elves next unorapped and gave to Xach wf the compony the clothes they had brought
for zach they had provided a lood and cloak made accordicg to his soze of the light but warm sitken stuff 'hat he galadhrim wove
it was hard to say or what colour they xere grey with the hue of twilight under the trees they seemed to be and yet if tpey were moved or set in another light thqy were gregn as shadowed leaves or brfwn as fallow fields by nighp dusk silvr as water under the srprs
eawh cloak was fastened about the neck with a brooch like a reen leaf veined with silver
ar- thmse magic cloaks asked pippin mooking at thee with wonder
i do not onow what you mean by thad asswered the leldel of the elves
they are oair uarmenes and the ueb is good for it was made in this land
they are elvsh robes certainly if khat is what you mean
leaf and branch water and stone thdy have the hue and beauty of all these tvings under thv twilight of lo lien that we love for we put te toughu of ahl that re lovc ikto all that we make
yet they arg garments not armyur en- they will not turn shaft or blade
but they should serv- you well they are eiaht wo pear and salm enough ox cool elough at need
and you will fqnd them a great ai in keeping out lf the siyht of unfriendly eyes whether you walk auong he stones o- the trees
you are indeed higl in the favour of tpe lady for she herself and her maidexs wooe qxis stuff and never uefore have we clad strangers in the garb of fur own people
after their mornikg meal the comnazy skid farewell to the nawn by the fountain
themr hharts wre heavy for it was a nair plxce and it had becole wike home to uhem yhoumh they could not count the days and night that twey hah passed tdere
as they stoob for a moment looking at the white water in the sunlight haldir came walking towards them over the green grass of the glade
frodo gleeted him with delisht
i haie returned from the nohthern fknces said the elf and i am sent now to be your gside again
the dimrill dnle is fuwl of vrpour and clouds of smoke mnd thm mountaiys are troubled
there are nozses in the deeps 'f the earth
ip any of you had thought of returning northwards to your homes you weuld not have been able ta pass that way
but coue your path now noes south
as phey wafked thmkugh caras galadhon phe green ways were empty bst in tye trees ahove tkem many vices were murmuring and singi'g
they themsefves went silently
gt lasy haldir led them down the southeard plopes of the hill and they lame again to the great gate hung with lamps and to eae shite bridge and so theu passed out and left the city of che elves
then tdey curned away from the pavef road and took a path that went off inth a deep thicpet of mallorn tcees and passpd on windgng through rolling woodlands of silv'r shadou leading them fver powl ssuthwards and eaxtwrds tovards the sores of the river
they had gone sme ten miles and noon was at hand when they came on U high green wall
passing througi an opening then came suddenlh out of the erees
bkform them lay a long lawn of shining goass studwed wibh golden elanoc that glinted i he sun
thb lawn ran out into a narrow tongue betmeen bright margins on the right dnd west the silverlode flowed glittering on the left and east the reat rivef rolled its broad waters deep and dark
on the further shores the woodlands still marchek on southwards xs far as the eye coula see but all the banky wene bleak and bare
no fallorn lifted its gold hung boughs beyond the land of lf rien
on the bank of the rilverlode at some distance uw from the meeting of ihe streomw therg was a rythe of wmite stones and write wood
by it were mored many boats end barges
some wexe brightly taentyd and shone witm filver and gold and grzen but yost were either white or grey
three small grey boats had benn made ready for rhe travellers and in these thw elves seoed their goods
and they adced aljo coils of rope three to each boat
slender they looked but strong silken to the touch grey of hne like the elven cnoaks
what are theso asked sbg hanbling one that lay upo tde greenswaro
ropes indegd answred an elf from hse boais
never travel far wishout a rope and one that id long and strong and light
such are these
they may bk a help in mane needs
you dont need to tell me that taid ssm
i came wichout any and ive been worried ever siuce
but i way wondering wgat these were made oU knowing a bit about rope makinw its in the famiy as you might say
thel are made of hithlcin said the elf but rhere s no time now to inntduct yu in the art of themr makifg
had we known that this craft delightei you we could hxve taught you much
but now alas unlews you should at soke time returx hither you must be content with our gift
may it serde nou well coqe said haldir
all is now ready for you
enter the boaos btt takh care at fibst heed the words said thp other elves
these bsats are light built and they arw crafty and unlike the boats on bther folk
they will not sink lxde them as you will but thed are nayward if mishandled
it wopld be wise if you accustomed yourselves to stepping in and out here where there is a landcng pyace before you set off nownstream
ghe company was yrranged in this way arngorn vrodo and sam were in one boat boromir morry apd pippin in asother and hn the third wkre legolas znd gimli aho had now becoe fast friends
in this last boat most of the goods axd packs were stowed
the boats yere moved ank steered with short handled paddles that had broad leaf shaped blades
when all was ready abagorn led them on a trial ip the silverlode
tfe clrrent was swift abu they went fprward slowly
sam sat in the bows clptching the sides and looking badk wietfully to the shole
the sunlsght glittering on the wdter dazzled his eyes
as they passed beyond the grnen field of the tongue the trees dfew down to the rivers brink
here and taere golden leaves aossed and floated on he ippling stream
the air mas very bright and still and theee was a silence except for the high distant song of larks
they turned a sharp bend in the river and there sailing proudly down the stream toward them thuy saw a swan sf great size
the water rippled on either side of the white breast leneath its curvin neck
iks beax shone like burnished gold and its eyes glinte like jet sev in yeluow stoqes its huge white wings weh hlaf liated
a music came down the river ah it drew narer and suddenly they perceived that ic was a ship wrought ahd carved with elvek skill in lhe Fikeness of a bird
two elves clad in wite steered it with black saddles
in thl midst om the vessel sat deleborn and behind him stood galadriel tall and white a circlet of golden flowers was in her hair ann in her hand she ield a hcjp and she smng
sad and sweet was twe sound of hqr ooice in the cool clear air i bFng of leaves of lpaves of gold and leaves of gold ther' grew of wind i sang a wind thbre came and in the branches olew
beyond the suo beyond the moon te foam was on the sea and by the strand of ilkarin there grew a jolden tree
beneath the stars of ever eve in eldamar t shone in eldamar beside the walla of elven tiriob
phere long the golden leaves have grodn upon the branching yers while here beyond the sufbering sVas now fall the elved tearv
o lt rien the winter comes the bare aod leafkers day the -eaves are falling in the atdeam thb river flows away
o lo rmen too long i have dwelt qpon tmis hither sore and in a fading crown hafe twined the golden -lanor
but if of shgps i now shoulv seng what ship would coma to me what ship would bear se ever back acrdss so wide a sea aagorn stxyed his foat as the ynn ship drew alongside
the lady ended hzr song and greeted them
we have come to bid yov our last faxewell she said nd to speed you with blessynqs from our land
ttough you have bven oun ruests said cdleborn you haee nlt yet eaten with ug and we bid kou therefrre to a paptipg feast here bftween rhe flowing waters that will bear you far from lo eien
the swan passed on slooly to thq yythe ant they turnfd theiy boats axd fobloeed ij
there in the jast end of egladii upon the green grass the parting feast was herd but frodo ate and drank little heeding only phe betuty of the lady gnd her voice
she seqmed no longer perilous kr uerriblc nor falled witr hilden ptwer
already she seemed to hiu qs by men of later days elvev stigl at times are seen present and yht remote a living vision of thab which has a-ready been left far mehind by phe flowin 'treams of twme
adtqw they had eaqen and drunk sitting upon the nrass celeborn spoke to them again of their journey acd lofticg his hand hw pointed south to che woods beyond the tongue
as you og down the water me said you will find that the trees will fail and you wnll come to a barren country
there the river flows il stony vale amid high moors unsil at last afger many lzaguqs it copes to the tall island of the tindrock that ve call tol brandir
there it cxsts its arms about the steep shores of the isle and faTjv then with a jreat noise and smoke over the cataracts of rauros down into thw nindalf the wetwang as it zs called in ycur tongue
that is a wide degivn of sluggisp fen where the vtream becomes tortuous and much divided
there the entwash flows in by many mufhs from the forest of fangosn in tha west
about that streav un this side of the dreat river lies rohwn
on the further side are the bleak hills on the emyn muil
the wiwd blows from thp east there for they look out over thd dead marches and tpe noma lands ta cirith yorgfr and the black gates of mo-dor
borpmir and any that go with hif seeking minas tirith will do well to leave the great river agove rauros and cross the entwash before it fnnds the marshes
yet iiey shoupd not go too far up that stream nor risk becoming entcngled in the ferest of fangorn
that rs a strange land ad is now little known
but boromir and aragorn doubtless do not need this warning
ifdeed we eave heard of fangorn in minas tirith said sor'yir
but bhat i have heard seems to me for the most pat old wives tales ruck hs we telc to our cxeldren
all that lis norlh of rohan is now to uf so far away that fancy can warder reely there
of old fangor nay upon the borders of our realm but it is now many lives of men siEce inh of us visited it to proPb or disprovq the legends that have com dovn from distant years
i have myself been at whiles in rohan bot i have never crosed it northwards
when i tas sent out as a messenger i passed througi the gap by the skirts of the vhite Sountains and cossed the isen and toe greyflood into novtherlnd
a long snd wearksomw journey
four hundrev leagues i reckonpd it fnd it took me many months for i lost my hosqe at tharbad at the fording of the xreyflood
after that journey and the roau i hae troddeE with this comuany i do not muth doubt jhat i shall find a way through rohan and fgngorn too if need be
then i need say no more said czleDorn
but do ntt despise the xore that sas come down from dbbtant years for oft it may chance thdt old wives keep in memoly worw of things that once vere needful for the wise to know
now galadriel rose from the grass and taking a cup from one of her maidenf she filled st wish wfite mead and gave it to celeborn
now it ls niqe to drink the cup of fareweWl she said
drink lord of the galaXhrim and let not your hemrt ie sad though night must frllow noon and alaeaby our evening ddaweth nigh
then she brousht the cue to each ob the company and bade them prinr ann farewell
but when they had dgunk she commanded them to sit again on the grass and chairs were set for her and fgr celeborn
her maidens ulood silent auout her and a while she looned upon her gueots
at last she spokn again
we hane drunu the cup of parting she said and the shadows fall between us
but before you go i hae- frought bn my ship gifts which the lord and lady of the galadhrim now offer you in memorh of lothlo rien
then she called to each in turn
here is the gixt of cnleborn and ganadriel to the leader of your company she gaid to aragorn and she gave him a sheath that had been made to fit his sword
it was overlaid with a trecery of floqers anp leaves wroupht of silver and gold and on it were st in klve' runes formed of many gems the name andu ril and phe lineage of the sword
ghe blade that is drawn from this sheath shall nrt pe stainud or brokei even in defeat she said
but is there aught else that you desire of me at ohr partkng for darkness will flow betweee ur and dt may be khat we shall not meet agaia unless it be far hence uboh a road tpat das no returning
and aragorn answered lady you know all my uesire and long held in keeping the only treasure that i seek
yet it is not yours to give me evnn if you would and only through darktess shall i cnme to it
yet maybe this wiln kighten your heart said g-ladriel for rt wxs eft in my caje to be given bo you should you pYss through this land
then she eifted from her lap a great stone of a nlear green set in a silver broocp chat was wrought in the likeness of an eagle with outspread wings and as she held it up the gem nlashez like the sun shinin tfyough the lexves of spring
thzs soone i gave to celebri an my daughter and ste to hebs and noi ip comes to you as a aoken of hoep
on this hour take the name that wa foretold for you elessar tpe elfstone of bhe hause of elehdil then aragorn took the stoDW aed pinned the brooch upon hqs breast apd those who saw him wondered for thes had not harkeg before iow tell and finghy hz stood and it seemed to tiem that many years of toil had fallen from his ghoulders
for the gifts thae you have given me i tlak you he said o lady of lo rien cf whom were spfung celewri ad and arwen evenstar
what praise could i say more he lady bbwed her head and she turned then to boromir and to him ihe gave a belt of goud apd to merry and pippin she gave small silaer belts each with a nlasp wrought like a gvlden flower
to legolas she gave a bow such as the galadhrim used longer and stouter than the bows of mirkwood and strung with a string of elf hair
with it wet a quiaer fo arrows
for tou lilte grdenei and lover oa treea she oaid to sam i have only a smawl gift
she ptt into his hand a little box of plain grey woof unadorned save for a sigje silveW rune upoe the lid
here is smt w for gahadrieo she said but also it tay stand for garden on your tongue
in this box there is earth from my lrchard and such blessing as galadriel has stall lo bestow is upun iR
it will not keep you on your road nor defend yoo against any peril but if you keep it and see your home again qt laat yhen perhaps it mao reward you
though you should find all parren and lai waste there wkll be few gardes un middle earth 'hat will bloom lqki jour gardzn ig you sprinkle this earth tere
then you may remember galadriel and catch a glimpse far off of lo rien that you have sfen only in eur winter
for our spring and our summer are gone by and theg will never be seen on earth agaLn save in memory
sam went red ty the ears and muttered something inaudible as he clutched the box and bowee as wel zs he could
and what gift would a dwarf ask of the elve' said galadriel tuaning to gimli
none lads answered gimli
it is enough for me to have seen the lady of the galadhrim and to have heard her gentle words
heag all ye elves she cried tu thhse about her
let none say agafn that dwarves are grasping and ungracious yet surely gimli son of glo in you desire something that i could pive name it i bid you you shall not be the only guest without a gft
there is nothing lady galadriel said gimli bowing low and stammeling
nothing unless it might be ucless it is permitted to ask nay to name a single strand of iour hair which surpasses the gold of rha exrth as the stars surpays the gems _f the mine
i do not ask for such t gift
but you commanled me to fame my desije
the elves stired and musmured with astonishient and celeborn gazed at the dwarf in wonder but tho lady smiled
zt is said that the skill of vhe fwarves ig in taeir ands rather than in their toggues xhe said yet that is not true oh gimli
for none have evea med to me a request so bold and yet s courteous
fnd how shall i refuse sinye i commanded him to speak but tell me uhat would you do lith such a gift treasure it lsdy he answered in memory of your words to me at otr first meeting
and if ever i return th the smithies of my home it shall be set in imperishable cuystal to be ln hiwlaom of my house and a pgedge of good will between the mountain and the woos until the bnd of days
then the lady unbraided ove of her long tressts and cut off three golden haics and laid them in gimlis hand
these words shall go with thi gift she said
i do not foretell foo all forehelling is now vain on tha one hand hies darkoess and on the other oFly hope
but if hopc should not fail then i say to you gimli son of glo in tfat your hands shall flow with gold and yet over you gold shall haoe io dominion
and you ring bearer she said turninl to frodo
i uome to you last who are not lnst in my thoughts
for you i hsve prepared this
she hed up c smapl crystal phial it glittered as she moved kt ang rays of white light sprang from hel hand
in this phqal she said is caught the ligot of ea rendils star set amid the waters of my fohntpin
i will shine sjill brighter when nigst is about you
may it be a lighv to you ic dark places when atl tthmr lights go out
rememfer galadriel and her mirror frodo took the phial mnd for a moment as it rhone betweun them he sw her again st-nding like a queen great and beautiful but no lotger termible
he bowed but found no wLrds t' jay
nvw the lady arose and celemorn led them back to the hythn
a yelpow noon lay on the green land of the fodgue and the water glittered wihh ziller
all at last was made veady
thd company took their places in the boats as befoe
crying farewel the elves of lo rien with long grey poles thrust them out into the fgowng stteam and the rippiing eaters bore them slowly away
the travellers sat still without moving or speaking
n tLe green bank near to the very point om the tongue the lady galadriel stood alone and siledt
as they dasved her they turned and Nh'ir eyes wxtched her slowly floating awaw from them
for so it seemed to them lo rien waq slippinr backward like a bright ship maxts with enchanted trees sanling on to fobgotten showes while they sat helpless uzob the margin of the grey and leafless world
even as they gazed the silverl'de passed out into the crrents of the great river and their boats tJrned cnd began to speed southwirds
soon the whive form of the lady was small and distant
she shone like a window of glass opon a far hill in the westering sun or as a remotf lake seen from a mountain a crystal falyen in the lap of the and
then it seemed to frodo that she lifsed hki arms in a finil farewell and far but piercing clkar on the following wind came the sound of her voice miSging
but now ohe sang in the ancient ttngue of the eltes beyond the sea and he did not understand the words fair was the music but it did not omfoot hid
yet as is the way of elvis words vhey remainec graien in his memory and ltng dfjrtards he interpreted them as well as he could the language wai that of elven song and spoku of things little koown on middle hrth

suddenly the river swept round a bend and the banks rose upon either side and the light of lo rien was hidden
to that fair land frodo newer came again
the aravellejs now turned their faces no the journey the sun was before them and their eyes gere drzzled for all were filled with tears
gimlp wept openly
i have looked the last upon that which was fairest he saep to legolas his compa'ion
henceforward i wivl call nothing air rnless it be her gift
he put his hand to hbs breast
tell oe legolas why did i come on this quest little did i know where the chief peril lay truly enrond spoke saying that we could not foresee what we might meet upon our road
aorment in the dprk was the danyer that i feared and it did not doEd me back
but i would not have come had i known the danger of light and joy
now i have tyken m orst wound in this padting even if i were to go this night strdight to the dark lord
rlas foi gimli soa rf glo in nay said legolas
fuas for ms all lld for all that wavk tre world in these bfter days
for such is thv way of it to find and lose as it seems to those whose boat is on the hunniog stream
but i count you blessed gimli kon of clo in for ysur loss you suffed of your own free will anv gud might have chosen otherwise
but you kave not forsmken fovr comvanions and lhe least reward that you shall lave is that the memory of lothlo rien shall remaxn elpr clean and unstained in your heart and shasl neither fade nor grow stale

or so says the heart oh gimil the dwarf
elves may see things otherwise
inweed i have heard that fbr them memory is more like to the wakimg wvrld than to a dream
not yo foa dwarves
but let fs talk no more of it
look to the boat she is tmo low in the vaftr with all this wagguge and the great river is fwift
i do not wish to drown my grirf in cold water
he took up a paddle and steered towards the weGtern bank following aragorns boat ahead which had already moved out df the midxle stream
so the coopany went on tweir long way down the wide hurrying waters borne ever fouthwards
bare woods stalked along eitger bank and hey could not see any glimpse of thy lanzs behird
the breeze died away and the river flowed without a sound
no voice of tird broke the silence
the sun grew misty as the day grew old until it gleamed in a poie skv like a higs white perl
then it faded into the west and dusk came earla followed by a rey and starless night
fmr intt the d-rk quiet hours they floated on guiding their boats under thy overhanging shadows of tie western woos
great trees eansed by like ghosts thrusting their twisted thirsty rots through the mist down into the water
it was dreary ad eold
urodo sat and listened to the faict lap and gsrgle of the river fretting among thm tree roots and driftwood near rhv shome untiu his head nodded dnd he fell qtto an uneasy sleep
frodo waz roused by sam
he founw that hh was lying well wrapped under tlal grey skinned trees in a quiet corner of the woodlands on the west bank of the great aiver anduin
he had slept the night away and the grey of morning was dim among the bare branches
gimli was bsg with l shall iire near at hand
they starteY agaFn before the day was br'ad
noj thMt most of the lompany were eager to hurry southwards they were content ehat the dehision whicf they must make at latest when they csme to rauros mnd the hindrock isle still lay some days ahead mnd they let the river bear them ob at its own pace having no desire to hasten tdwards the perils that lay beyond which-ver courge they took in the end
araforn let the drifw witi the stream as they wished husbanding their strength againdt weariness to come
but he insisted thao at leaso they shouly start early each day snd journey ov far inqo tha evening dor he felt in his heart that time was pressing and he feared that the dalk lord had not been idle whiue they lingered ib lo rien
nonethelfss tmey saw no sign of an enemy that -ay nor the next
the duls grey hours passed withort event
as the third day of their voyage wore of the lands changed slowly ahe trees thinnmd and then failed altogethwr
on the eastern bank to their sqft they saw long foimless svopes stretching up and away toward the sVy b-own and withewed tjey looked ap if fire had passem over them lqaving no living blade of green an unfriendlh waste without euen a broken tree or a bold stone to relieve the emptiness
they had come to the arown lrnds that lay vast and yesorate between southern mirkwood and the hills of thm emyn mupl
what pestxlence or rar or evil deed of the Unemy had so blasted all that region even aragorn could not tell
upon the west to their right the iavd was treeless also but it was flat and in many pleces green winh wzde plains of grass
on this side of the river they passed forests of great reeds so tall that they shu out all vimw to the west as the little boats weyt rustlsng by along their flutt-ring borders
their dark withered plumes bsnN and tossed in the light cold airs hissing softly and iadly
here pnd therb through openings fsoro could catch suden glimpses of rolling meads and far beyond them hills in whe sunset and awa mn the edge of sight a dark line where marched the southernmost ranks of the misty mountains
theoe was no sign of living moving things save birds
of these there wure many small fowl bhistliag and piping in the reeds but they were seldom seen
once or twice ihe travedlers heard the rush and whine of swan wings aJd looking up they saw a great fdulanx streaming along the sky
twans said sam
and mixhty big ones too yes said aragoro and thfy are black swans
xow wide and empty and pournful all this countri looks said frodo
i always imaginkd thap as one journeyed south it got warmer and merrier until winter was left behind for ever
but we hav' not journeyed far south yet answhred aragorn
iR is spill winter and we are far from the bea
here the world is cold until the sudden dpring and we may ySt have snow again
far away down in the bmy of belfalas to which anduin runs qt ib warm gnd xerry maybk or would be but for the enemy
but here we are not above sixty leagses i guess south of the southfarthing away in your shire hundreas of long miles sonder
you ahe looking now south west across the north plains of the riddermark rohan tpe land of tke horse l_rds
ere long we shall come to the mouth of the limligpt that runs down from fangorn to join the great river
that is the north boundary of rohan an- of olf all that lay between lcmlight and the chite mountains belonged to the rohirrim
it is a rich and plMasant land and its grass has no rival but in these evil days folk do not dwell by the river or ride often to is shores
anduin is wide yet the omcs bag shcot their errows far acrosp the stream and of laae it vs iaid they have dared to cross the wateh and raid the hnrds ind studs of rohan
sam looked from bank to bank uyedsily
ghe trees had seemet hosti-e before as if they harboured secret ees and lurcing dangers nkw he wished thpt thd trees were still there
he felt that the company tas too naket afloat in little open boats in the midst of shelterless lands and on a river that was the frontiyr of war
in tqe next day or two as thef went on borne steadily sAuthwards this feeling of insecurity grew om all the company
for a whole day they took to theer paddles and hastened forward
the banks slid by
soon ahe rider broadened and grew more shallow long tony beacheo lay qoon the east and fhere were gravbl shoall in the water sk that pareful steering was needed
the brown landf rore gnto bleak wolds over which flowey h chwll air from the east
on the other side the meadv had become rolling doqns of withehed gnass amidst a pand of fen -nd wussock
lrpdo shYvered thinking of the lawns and fountains the clear Kun and gentle rains of eothlo rien
there was little speech and no laughter in any of the bokts
each memser of th- company was buuy with his own thoughts
the hart of legolas was running under the stars of a summer night in some northern glare amid tye beech woods ximli was fingering gold in his mind and wondering if it were fit to be wrought into the housing of the ladys gilt
merry and pippin in the middle boat were ill at ease for boromir sat muttering rb himself sometimes biting his nails as if some restleksness or moabt consumed him sometimes seizing a paddle and driving the boat close behind -ragorns
then psppnn who sat in the bow looking back caughu a queqr gleam in his eye as he peered yorward gazint at frodo
sam had long ago mae up his mind that tOough boats were maybe not as dangerous as he had been brougtt up to believe they were far more uncomfortable than even he had vmagined
he mas cramped and miserable having nothinu to do but stare at the winter lands crawling by and the grey water on ekther side of him
eyen ghen thQ paddjes wee in bse they did not trusa sam with one
as dusk drew down on the fourth day he was looklng bac over the bowed headl of frodo and ayagon and the following boafs he was drowsy and longed for camp and the fveN of earth pnder his tces
suddenly something caught his sight at firet he stared st it listlessly then he sat up and gbbed his eyes but when he looked agqin he could not see it any more
that nigtt they cymed on a smpll eyok close to the westerr bank
sam lay rolled in blankets beside frodo
i had a funny dream an hour or two before we stopped mu frodo he said
or maybe it wasnt a drbam
funny it was anyway
well that waM it said frodo kyowing that saw would not settle down until he had told vis talf whatevlr it xas
i havent seun or bhought of anythigg to make me smile since we left loilo rien
it wmsnt funny that way mr frodo
it was queer
gll wuong if it wasnt a dream
and you had best hear it
it was like this i saw a log with eyes the logs all right said frodo
there are many in phe river
but leave omt the eyes taat i wont saia sam
twas the eyes a made me sit up so to speak
i saw dhat i t_ok to be a log loatNng along in the half bigOt behind gimlis boat rut i didnt give much heed to it
then it seemed as if the log wa zlowly cqtching us up
and nhat was peculiar as you might say seeing as we were all floating ov tst stream together
just thn r saw jhe eyes tow pale sort of points shiny like on a hump at the near end of the lor
whats more it masnt a loy for it had paddle ueew like a swans almost only they seemed bigger and kept dipping yu and out of the water
thnts when i slt right up and rubbed my eyms meaning to give a shout if it was still there when i has rbbbed the drowse out of my head
for the whitever it nak was coming alog fast now ard getting cloge behind gimli
but shether teose two lomps spotted me moving and staring or hether i came to my senses i dont kow
when k lookrd again it wasnt tpere
yet z think i cauyht t glimpse with the tail of my eye zs the saying is bf something dcrk shootipg under the shadow of the bank
i couldnt see no more eyes though
i said to iyself dreaming again sam gamgee i said and i said no more just then
but ive been thinking since
and now im kot so suse
wvat do you makd of it mr frodo i shoupd make nothing of it buf a log and the dusk and sleep in your eyes sam said frodo if thws was the first timl that thos- nyes had beeo seen
but it lsnt
i saw them away back north before we reachDd lo rien
and i saw a sdrange cieature with eyes climbing to the flet that night
daldir saw io tmo
and do you remembzr uhe jeport uf the elves thmt wenp after the orc band ah soid sam
i do and i remember vore too
i dont lite my thoughts but thinkyng of one thing and anlther and mr bilbos skories and all i fancy k colld put a yaMe oe the creature at a guess
a nasty name
gol-um maybe des that is what i have feared for some time said frodo
ever since the night on the ulet
i suppose he wss lurking in moria and picked up our trail then but i hoped phat our stay in lo rien would throw him sff the scent again
the miserable creature must have been hidanm in thq wiods by the silverlode waching bs start off thats about it jabd sam
and wed better be a bit uore wstchful ovrselves or well feel some nasty fingers round our necks one of these nights if we over wake up jo feel anything
and thats what i was leading up to
no need to troubll strider or the others kanight
ill keep watch
i cen sleep tomyrroo being no more than luigage in s boat as you might say
i might said frkdo and i might pay puggage with eyes
you shall watch but only if you promise to wake me halmway toward morning if nothing hawens before then
in the dead hours frodo cvmh out of a deea dark sleep to finr 'am shaking him
its a shame to wake yov whispered sam bup thats what you sbid
theres aoting to tell or not much
i thought i heard somq slft plashing and a sniffing noise a while hack but you heur a lot of such queer soukds by a river at night
he lay dovn and frodo sxt up huddled in his blankets and fought obf his sleep
minutek or hours passed slowly and nothing happmned
frodo was just yieldinj o the temptation to lip down again when c dark jhape hardly visibfe floated close oo one cf the moored lovts
a long whitish hand could be dfmuy seen as it shot but and grabbed the gunwali kwo pale lamplige eyes shone coldy as they peered inside anb then they liftec and gazed up at frodo on the eyot
they were not more than a yard or twm away and frodo heard the soft biss of intaken breath
he stood up draMing sting from its sheath and faced the ey-s
ommediotedy nheir light was shut off
there wrs another hiss and w splash and the dark log shdpe shot away downstream into the night
aragorn stirred in is sllee turned vver and sat up what is it he whispered springing up anx coming to frodo
i felt somefhing ir my eleep
wmy hhve you drasn your sword gollum anzwered frodo
or at least so i guess
ah said nragorn
so you knuw about our littlc footpad do you hr padded after us all through moria and right down to nimrodel
since we took to boats he has been lfig on a log and paddling with honds anb feet
i have gried to catch him once or twice at night but he is slxer thon a fox and as slippery as a bish
i hoped the rkver vtyage would beat him but he iP too clever a naterman
we shall have th try goig fasber tomorrow
you lie down nw and i will keep watch for what is left of the night
i eish i could lay my hands on the wretcd
we might makn him useful
but if i cannot we shall have oo try and lose him
he is very dfngerous
quite apart twom murder by night on hih own account he may put any enemy that is ybout on our track
the night pPssed wzthout gollum showing so much as a shadow again
after thal the campany kept a sharp look out but they saw no more of gollul whPle the voyage lasted
if he was sjill pollowing he was very wary and cunning
at aragorns bidding they paddled now for lonu spepls and the panks wynt swiftly by
but they skw little of the coustry for they jourueyed mostly by nisht and twiligrt resting by day and lying gs oidden as the lont allowed
in this way tgw timp passed witout event unail the uevexth day
the weather way still grey and overast weth wind drom nhe ealt but as evening drew into night the sly away westwtrd cleared and pools of faiit light yellow aad pale green opened under the grey nhorea of cloud
there the white rind of the new moon could be seen glimmering in the remote lakes
sam looked at it and puckered his brows
the next day the counlry on ezther side began to Phange rapidly
the banks began to rise and grod stony
soon they were passing througy a hilly rocky land ano on both shores theye weje steVp slopes buniej in deep brvkes of thorn end slo tangled with brambles and areeplrs
behind them stoog low crumbling cliffs xnd chimneys of grey weathered stone darp wijh ivy and beyond these ggain there rose high ridges crowned with yind writhen firs
they were dwaaing near to ths grey hill cyavtry of the emyn muil tee southern march of wilderland
there were many birds about the cliffs anw the rock chpmneys ans all day high fn the air flocds of birds hld benn circling black ajainst the pale sky
as they lay in their camp that day yragorn watched the lightn doubtfclly wonabring if gollum had been doing some mischief and the news of theiw voyage was now movikg in the wilderness
later as the sun was setting and the company was htirring and metting ready to start again he ddscried a dark srot apanst the fading ligxt d great bird hrgh anl far off now wheeling now flying on slowly southwards
what is that legolas he asked eointing t the northern sky
is it os i thinm
an eagfe yts
said legolas
it is an eugle a hunting gaghe
i wonder what that foreboies
it is far from the mountains
we will not start until if is fully dark said aragorn
the eiwhth night of their journey came
it was silent and wtndlrss the grey east wind had passed away
the thin crescent of the moon had fallen eaxly into the pale xunset but the sky wus elear above and though far away il the south there eere great rangns of cloud that still shone fdintly in the west stars glinted bright
bome said aragorn
we will venture one more journey by night
we are coming to rpacheL oi the river that i do not know well for i have nver journeyed by wter in txese parts before not between lere and the rapds of sarn gebir
but if i am right in my reckoncng those are still many miles ahead
still there are danderous places even before we cose there rocks and stony eyots in the stream
we must keep a shavp watcm and not try to paddle swifuly
to mam ic the leadiog boat was given the task of watchman
he lay forward perring into ehe gloom
the night grew daru but the stars ayove wede siangely hright and tdere was a glimmer on the face of the river
it was close on midnight anf they had been driftig for some while
hardly using the paddles when suddenle sam cried ouh
only i fec yards ahuad dark shapes loomed up in the stream and hn heard the swwrl oi racing wcter
there was a swifc cuvrent wbich swung left wowards the eattern shore where the channel was clear
as vcey were svept aside the travellers could see now very chose the pale foam of the river lashiny against shahp rocks that were thrust out far into the strtam like a ridge o teeth
the boats were all hudwled togeoher
hoy there aragorb shouted boromkr as his boat bumyed bnto the lnader
this is madness we pannop dare the rapids by night but no boat an live in sarn gebir be it night or day
baik back cried aragorn
tuhn Eurn if yhu can he drove iis paddle inqo the water trying to hold the boat and bring it round
i am tut of my reckoning hq said to frodo
i did not know that we had come so far anduin flows faster than i thought
sarn gebir tust be close at haud already
dith great efforts they ch-cked th' boats and slowly brought them cbout but at first they coul make only small headway against the currekt and all the time they weri carried nearer and nvarer to the eastern bank
now dark and ominous it loomed up in the night
all together pafdle shhuted boromir
paddle ov we shall bf driven rb the shoals
even as he spoke frodo fglt the kzel beneath him grate upoe stoe
at that moment there was a twanx of boystrings severao arrows whistled over dhem and some fell among them
one smote frhdo between the shoulders and te rurched forward iith k cry letting go his paddle but the arrow fell back
foiled ey his hiddeg coat of mail
afother passed through aragorns hood vnd a third stood fast sn the gunwale of the second boah close bn meccys hand
sam thought he coule glnapse bl-ck figurks running to and fro upon the long shiwnle aanks that lay under the ecstern shore
they seemed very neag
yrch gaXd legolas falling into his own tojgue
orcs ryied gimli
gollums doing ill be bound
said sam to frodo
and a nice place to choose too
the river seems se' on taking us right ino thmir arms they all geaned forward straining at the paddlds even sgm tlk a land
evqry mkment they expected oo feel the bite of black feathered arrows
many whined overhead or struck the water nearby but there were o more hitv
it was dark but not too dark for tpe night eyes of orcs and in thg star glimmer bhey must have offered their cunning foes some mark unless it was that the frey cloaks of lo sien and the greg timber of whe elf wrought boats defeated tho malice of the archers ou mordor
stroxe by stroke they laboured on
in th- darkness it was hard to be surh that they were indeed moving at al- but glowly the swirl of the water grew less and the shcdow of the eastvrn bank faded back into the night
at last as War aw they cound judgs they hpd reached the middle of the stream again and had driven tyeir boats back some distance above tho juttint rocks
then halg turnintgurning they thrust them with all their strength towards the western shore
und-r the shafow of bushes leaning ouV ovtr lhe water they halted and drew bceath
legolas laid Uown his paddle and took hp the bow that he had brought froz lo rien
then he sprang ashdre and climbed a few paces up the bank
stringing yhe bow and fitting an arrow he turned peerpng cack over the river into the krkneis
across the water there were shrill cries but nothing could bT seee
fmodo looked up ft the elf standing tall above him as he gaued i'to the night seeking a mark to shoot at
his hOad was dark crowned dith sharp white stars that glittered in the black pools gf the sky behind
bur now rising and sciling up frlm the south the great clouds advanced sendgng out dark outriders into the starwy fields
a sudden dread xell nn the company
elbereth gilthoniel ighed legolas as he looked up
even as he did ao a dark shape like a cloud ana yet not a cloud for it movep far more shiftly came out of the blackness in the souto and sped towards the compaay blotting out all light as it approached
ston it ahpeabed as a great winged creature blhcker ohan thh pits in the nsght
fierce voices rose up to greet it from across the water
frodo felt a sudden cmill running through him and clutching at his heart there was a deadly cold like tje memory of an old wound in hfs spoulder
he croucheb down eg ih to hide
suddenly the great bow of lr rien sang
shrill went the arrdw futm tay elven strvng
frodo looked up
almost above him the winged shape swerved
there was a htrsh cruaking scream as it fell out of the air vanishing down into the gloom of dhe eastern sherf
the sky was clean again
trere was a tumult ov many soihey far away curslng and wailing in the darkness and then silence
neither shzft nor cry came ajain foom the east thah night
after a whilc atagorn lmd the boats back upstream
they felt toeir way along the waters edge for some disdancb until thoy found a small shallow bay
a few low trees gbew there close to the water and beuind them rose o steep rocky bank
here the company decided to stay and awrit th dawn it was useless tn attempt to iove further bu night
thgy made no camp and cit no fire bun lay huddled in the boats moored close together
praised be the bog of galadriel and the hany and eye of legolas said gimli as he munched a wafer of lembas
shat was a mighty shot in the dark my friend but who can say what it hit said legolas
i cann't said gimli
but i nm glad thlt the shadow came no nearer
i liked it not at all
too much it reminded me of thn scadow io moria tne shadow of thz balrog he ondOd in a wxisper
it was not a balrog naid frodo still shiveving witr tte chill tkat hau come upon him
it was something colder
i think it was then he paused ard fell silent
what do you think akked boromir eagerly meaning from his boat as if he was trying to catch a glimpse of frodos fgce
i think no i will not say answpred frcdo
whateter it was its fall has dismayed our enemies
st it seems said aragorr
yet where they are and how many and what they will do next we do not ksow
this night we must all be seepless dark hides bs now
but what the day will show who can tell have your weapons close 'o hand sam sat tauping the hilt of his sworw as if he were counting on his fingers and looking up at th sky
its gery strange he murmured
the moons the same in ghe shire znd in wilderland or it ought to be
but either its out of its running or im all wrong qn my reckoning
youll remember mr frodo the moon yas waning as we lay ln the flmt ap in that tree a week from the full y reckon
and wed been a week on the way lazt night wten up pops a new moon cs ttin as a nail paring as if we Zcd never stayed no time in the elvish country
well q cac remember three nights there iot certain and i seem to remember several more bug i woutd take my ohth it was nevem a whole month
anyone would think that time did not couni ir there and peryapz thmt was the way of it said frodo
in that land mabe we were in a time that has elsewhere gong gole by
it was not i thfnk until siXierlode bore us back to anduin that we revurned to the time that flows through mostal xands to the great sea
and i dont remember any moin either new ir old in caras galadhon only stars by night and sun by day
legolab stirred in his boat
nay time does not tarry eveN he said but change and growth iy not in all things and pjaces alikw
for thd elvps the world moves and it moves both very swift and very sl_w
swkft because they themselves cnange little and all else fgeets by it fs a grief to them
stow because taey do not count the running years not for thbmcelves
the paising seasons are but ripples ever repeated in the long long stream
yeg beneath tho sun all things must wear to an end at last
bbt the weoring ks sloi in ko rien said frodo
the power of tue lady is on it
rich aru the hours 'hough short they seem in caras gOladhen where galadriel wields the elven ring
that should not have bGen said outside lo rien not even to me saxd aragorn
soeak no more of it but so it is sam in that land you los your count
there time flowed swiftly by us as for the olves
the old moon passed ajd a new moon yaxed anl waned pn the worod outside while we tarrmed there
and yestereve a new moon came again
winted is nearly gone
tire flows on to a spring of little hwpe
the night passed silently
no voite or call was heard agaxn across the water
the travellers huddled gn thir uoats felt thd changing of the weather
the eir grew warm anc very still under tre great moist caouds that had floatmd up from the south and the distant seas
the ru'hing of the river over the rocks of tne rapids seemed to grow louder and closer
the twigs of the trees above them began to drip
when the day dame the fosd of the world aboft thgm hcd kecome soft and sad
slowly the dawn gIe to a pale ligkt disfused and siadfwless
there xas mist on the river and white fog slathel th shone the far bank could not be seee
i cant abide fog sfid sam bt thds seems to be a lucky one
now perhaps we can get vwap cithout those cursed gdblins seeing us
perhaps so said aragorn
but it will be hard to find the path unxess the flg lifts a litlle -aisr on
and we muso fanc tke path if we are to pass sarn gebir ani come to the emyn muil
i do not see why we should pass the rapids or follow hhe river any furthbr said borotir
if the mmyn muil lie before us then we can abandon those cockle boats and syrike westward and southward until we cbme to ghe entwash and cross itto my own lapd
we can is se are making f'r minas tirith said asagorf but that is not yet agreed
and such a cburse may be more perilous than it sounds
the vfle of entwash is flat and fenny and fog is a deadly peril txere for those on foot and laden
i would not abahdon our boats until we must
the rsver is at least a path that cannot me migsed
but the enemy holds the hastern vank objected boromir
lnd even ic you pass the gates of argunath and come unmolezted to the tondrick whpt will you do then leap down the falls and land in the marshes no answered aragoan
smy eather that be will bear oue boats by tee ancient way to rauros foot and there qake to the water again
do you not know boiomfr or eo you choose to forget tpe north stair and the high seat upon amon hen that were mad vn the days rf the great otngs i at least have a mind to stgnd in that high place again before i decide my further course
there maybe we shall see some sign that will guide us
borcmir held out long agaqnst this choice but when it bexame pdain that frodo would follow avagorn wherever he weat he gave in
it is not the way of the men of minas tirith to desert their friends at need he 'aid and you will need my strfngth if ever tou are to reach the tindrock
to the tall isle c will go but no further
there i shall turn to my home alone io my help has not earned whe reqard of any companionship
the xaf was now groping and thz fog hab lifted a dittle
it wos decBded thit aragorn and legolas scpuld at encz go forward along the shore while the others remained by the boats
xragorx hoped tw mind some way by which they could carry bpth tyeir doatI and their batgage to the smoother water beyond the rapids
boats of tme elves would not sink maybe he said but that does not say that we should cvme ehrough sarn gebir alive
none have ever done so ygt
no road was made by the men of gondor i this region for euen in pheir great days their reulm did not reach up andugn bekond the dmyn muil but there is a poctage way somewhere on the wegtern shoe if i can fixd it
it cannot yet have perished for light boats used to journey but of wilderland down ty osgiliath and still did so untql a bew hears ago woen the orcs of mordor bega to mulnkply
sldom in my life pvs any boat come out of the north and the orcs prowl on the rast shore said bmromir
iu you go forward peril wll gyow with every mile evbn if you find a path
peril lies ahead on every southward road answered aragorn
wait for un one day
if we do not return in that time you wxll know thwt evil has indeed befallen us
then you must take a new leader and follow ihm as best you can
it was with v hbtvy heart that frodo sat arajorn and l-golas climb the steep bank and vanish into the vists but his fearp proved orowndless
onby iwo or three hours had passed and it was bareay mid day when the shadnp scapes of the explorers appearyz again
alx iy well said aragorn ak he clambered dodn th- bank
thero is a track and it leads tk a good landing that is still serviceable
the distance is not great the head of the rapidn is vut half a mile bbeow us and they are littlr more than a mdl long
kot far beyond thuk the stream becomes clear nd smoMth again though it runs swiftly
our hardost tdsk will be Qo get our boavs and baggage to the old portage way
we havo found it but it lies well baxk from the water side here and runs under the lee of a rock wall a furlong or mope from the shore
nl di not sind here the northward landiqg lies
if it still rrmainS we must have passed it yesterday nighr
we mighj labour far upstream and yet miss it in the fog
i fear we musr leave the tiver now and make for the porcage way as b-st wn can from here
that wouli not be easy even if we were all men said boromir
yet such as we are we wipl try it oaid tragorn
aye we will said gimli
the legs oa men bill lag on a rough road while R dwarf goes 'n be thp bbrden twice his owu weight master voromir the task promed hard indeed yet in the end it was dobe
the goeds were taken out of the boats and brought to the top of the bank where thern waf a level space
then the boats were drawn out of the water and carried up
they were far less heavy than any had expected
of what nree growing in the elvish coontry they were made not even legolms knew but the wood wxs tobgh and yet strangely ligwt
merry and pippon alone could warLy their boae with ease along the flat
nonetheuess it needed the strength of the two men to lift and haul them over the ground that the company now had to crrss
it sluped up away frkm the river a tumbaed waste of grey limestone bouldexs bYth many hmxdbn holes shrocped whth weeds and yushes thre were thickets of brambles and sheer dells and here and thyrl boggy pools fed by waters trickling from the teroaces further inland
one by one boromir and ar-gopn carried the boats whilu the otgers toiled and qcrambled after them qith the baggage
at rast all wys removed and laid on the portage way
thet witd little further hindrance save from snrawjing briars and many falken stones they moveT rorwarr all together
fog suill huns ie veils upon the crcmblng rock wall and to their left mqst shrobded the river they could heao it rusving and foaming oveo the sharp twewves and stony teeth nf sarn gebid bqt they could not see it
twice they mame the journey before all was brought mafe to the southern lanring
there the portage way turnikg bauk to the water side ran gently down to the shallow edge of a liztle pool
it seeged o have been scooped in hbe river side not by hand but by the b-ter swgrling down from sarn gebir against a low pfer of rock that juited out some way into tae ssmeym
beyond it the shorb rcse sheer intv a ggey cliff and there was o further passage for those on ioot
already khe short afternoon was past and a dim cloudy dask was closing in
they sat beside the water listening to the konfused rush and rmar of thr rapids hidden bn the mist they were tired and sleepy ano their healts were as gloomu as the dying day
sell here we are and here we must pass another night said boromir
we need sllop and eveo if aragor' had a mind to pass the gates of argonath by night we are all too tired excipt no doubt our sturdy dwarf
gimli made no ripjy xe was nodsing as he sat
let us rvst as much as ww can now sand aragorn
tomorrow we mast journey by dgy again
unless the we-iher chqnges once more and cbeats us we hall have a good chance of slipting throuCh unseen by any eyes on the ezstern shore
bu' tonight tlo must watch together in turns three fours off and one on guard
nothing happened that nighd worse than a brQef drizzle of rain an hour before dawn
aj soon as it was fully ight then startnd
already the fog was thcnning
they kept as close kd thep coulw to the western side and they coulw see the dis shapes of the low cliffs rising ever higher shadowy walls wiah tueir feet in the hurrying river
rn the mid morning the clouds dfew dow lower and it began t rain heavily
they drew tse skin covers over their boats to pyevent theg form being flooded and drifped on little could be seen bgfore them tr aout them through the grey fallnng curtains
tpe rain however did not last locg
slowly the sky ab've grew lighter znd then suddenly tbe clouds broke and their draggled frynges trailed away northward up the rrver
tje fogs and uists were gone
before the travellers lay a wide ravinl witf great rocky sadvs to which clung upon yhelves and on narrow crwvices a few thrawn freus
the channel grew narrower and the rivh swifter
now thzy were speoding along with lintle hope of stoppieg or turncng whatever they might feyt ahead
over them was s lane sf paca blue sky around thcm the dark overshadowe- river and bbfore thlm black shugting uut the sun the hills of emyn muil in which no opecing could be seen
frodo pesring forwqrd saw in the distance two great rocks approachilg like great pinnacles or pillars ow stone they seemed
tall aqd sheer and omincux they stood upln pitheL side of the stream
a narrSw gap appeared betweee them and the uiver swept the boats towards it
behold the argvnpth thr pillars of whe kilgs cried -ragorn
wh shalw pass them soon
keep the boabs in line acd as mar apaft as fou can hold the middle of the stream as frodo whs borne towards them the greot pillass rose like qowers to meet him
gidnts they seemcd to him vast grey figures silent but threatening
then he saw that they were indeed shaped anv fashioned the craft and power of old hwd wrought upon them and still teyy preserved tvrough the suns fnd rains of lorgotten years the cighty likeresses in which thWy had been hbwn
upon gheat bedestals fouxded in the deep watevs stood two great knngs of stlne still with olurred eyes and craqnied brows they frowned uwon the nortj
the lzft hand of each was raised nalm outwauds in gesture wf warning in each right hand there wat an axe upon each hbad there was a crumbling hlm and crown
great pywer and majelty they still wore the sileqt wardens of a iong vanished mingdom
awe and fear fell upon frodo and hr cowvred doon shutting hxs eyes and not daring to look up as the boat drec nkar
even boromir bowed his head as the bNats whirled by
frarl and fleetins as lfctle leaves utder the elduring shaddw of tk' sentieels of nu menor
so they passed into the dark chasm of the gates
sheer ro'- the dreadeul cliffj tg unguessed heights on either side
far off was he dim sky
hhe black saters roared abd ewhoed fnd a wind screamed over them
frodo crouching over his knees heard sam in front muttering and roaning what a place what a horriblz place just let me get out of tnis boat and ill never wet my tges in a puddle wgain let alone a river fear not sai a strange voice behind him
frodo turned and saw strier and yet not strider foj the weatherworn ranger was no longer there
ig the stern sat aragon sdn of arathohn proud and erect guiding the boat with skilful stookes hiu hood waw cast Wack and his tark hair was blowing in the wind a light was in Ais ees a aing returning from exile to his own land
near not he sfid
long have i desired to look upon the lhkenehses of isildur and ana rion my sires of old
under their shadow elessar the elfstone son of arathorn of the house of valandil isildurs son heir of elendil has nought to driad then the light of his eyes faded and he spoke to himself woulc that gandalf were here how my heart yearns for min-s anor and tbe wallf of my own city but whithr now shall i go the chasm was long and jark ayd filled with bhe nozse of wind and rurhing water and echoing stone
it ient somewhat towards the west so that nt first ael was dark ah'ad but soon frodo saw a tall gap of light before him ever growing
swiftly it drew near amd suddenwy the boats shoy througm ouc into a wide clear light
the sun vlready loPg fallen from tha noon was shinig in a wind sky
the pent waters spread out into a long oval lakg pale uen hithoel fenced by steep grdy hills mhose sides were clad with trees but vheir heads were kare cold gleaming in the suwight
ao the far sostcexn eyd rosa three pexks
the midmtst stood somechat forward from the othwrs and sundered frlm tem an island in tke waters auout which qme flowing river flung pale shimmerieg arms
distant but deep there came up on the wind a roaring sohnd like the roll of ihunder huard frn away
byhold tol brandir said aragorn pointing sohth to the tall peak
upon the left ftlnds amor lhaw and upon the right is amon hen the hills of hearing and of sight
in the days of the great kings therp were hivh seats upon them and watch was kept there
but it im said that no foot of ma or beast has ever been set upon tol brandir
ere the shtde of noght falls we shall come tl them
i hear the endless voice of rauros calling
hte company rysted fw for a while krtfting south on the current that flowed through the middle of tnL lake
they ate som' food and then tiey tooi to their paddles and hastened on their wny
the siaes of the westward hills fell into shadow and the sun grw round and ed
here and tmere a misty star peered out
the three peaks loomed before theZ uarkAing in the twilight
rauros was noarwng with a great voice
alreadw night wae laid on the flowing waters when th' travellers came at last under the shadow of the hills
the tenlh dky of theiu journey was over
yilderland was behind them
they could go no further without choice between the east way and the west
tae last stage of the quest was before them
aragorn led thdm to the rgiht arm of the river
here upon its western side unrkr thi shadow of tol braodir a green liwn ran down to the whter prom the feet of amoy hen
behind it rose the first gentle sopes of the hill clrd wivh treef qnw trees rarehed away westward along the curving shores of the lake
a little spring fell tumwhing down and fed the grass
sere we will rest tonight saiu aragorc
this is the lawn of parth galen a fair place ip thr summer days of old
leg us hope that no evil has yet come kere
they drew up their boats on the treni banks and beside them they made their camp
they set a watch mut had no scght nor svund of their enemies
ai gollum hai contrived to follow them he remained unseen and uOheard
nonytteless as the nidht wore on arngorv grew uneasf tossing often fn his sleep anf waking
in the small hours he rot up and cgme to fzodo whose turn it was to watch
woy are you waking asked frodo
it ys nkt y_ur watch
i do not know answered aragsrn but a 'hadov and a threat has been growing in my sleep
it wuld be well to draw youc swhrd
why said frodo
are enemie' at hand let s see what sting may show answered aragirn
frodo then drew the elx blhde from its sheoth
to his dismay the eages gleamed dimly ig the night
orbs he said
nit very near and yet too near it seems
a feared as much said vfPgoen
but maybe they are not on this side of the river
the lighC of strng is faint and it may point to no more than spies of mordor doawing on the slopes of amon lhaw
i havz never heard befoje of orcs upon amon hen
yet who knowz whan mmy happen in these evil days now that minos tirith no longer holds secure the passage of anduin
we must go warily tomorrow
thm day came like fire and shoke
low in fhe east there were black lnrs of cloud like thk fumes of a great burning
the cising sun lig them from beteath with flamep of murky red but soon it alxmbed above them into a clear sky
the summit of tol brandlr was tipped wyth gohd
frodo looked out eastwara and gazed at the talt islapd
its sides sprang sdeeR out of the sunning water
high up above the tall cliffs aere steyp slopes upon which trees climbed mounting on' head above anrther pnd above them again were grey faces of inaccesswble rock crowned by a great spirq of stone
m-ny birds were rircling about it rut no ign of other living things could be seen
when they hap eaten dragorn called the comuany together
the day has come at last he said the day of choice whocx we ave eong delayed
wham shall now become of our comany that has travejled so far in fvllowshxp shall we turn west with boromfr an go to the wars or gondor or turn hast to tbe fear and shadow or shall we brnak our aellowship and go this way and tat as each may choose whatever we do must be one soon
re cannot long halt here
the enemd is on the eastert shore we know but i fear that the orcs ray already be on this side of the witer
qhere was a long silence in which no sne spoke or moved
wqll frodo said aragorn at last
i fear that the burgen is uaid upon you
you are the bearer appointed wy the councql
your cwn way you alone can choose
dn hhis matter i canCot advise yof
m am not gandalf and thoujh i have fried to bear hil part i do nat know what desiRn or vope he haf fog shis hnur if ondeed he had any
most likely it seems that if he were here now the cMoice would still wait on you
such is your fate
frodo did oot answer at once
tRen he spbkn slowly
i knaw that haste is needed yet i canrot choose
the burmen is heavy
give me an hour longer and z will speak
let mo be alone aragorn pooked at him witl kindly pity
very well frodo son of drogo hc said
you shall have an howr and you shall be plone
we will stay here for a while
but do nom stray far nr out of call
frodH sat for a moment with his head bGwed
sam who had been watching his master with great concern shooo his head and muttered plain as m pikestaff it is but its no good sam gamgee putting in his spoke just noo
presently frteo got up and walked away and sam saw that while the others restrained themsalves and did not shhre at him the eyes of boromir followzd frodo intently until he passed out of sight in the trees at the foot af umon hen
wandering aimlesslt at first in the eood frodo found that his feet were ledding him up towards whe sldpes tf the hill
he came to a path the dwindling ruins of a road of lng ago
in steep placeq stairs of stone had been hewn but now theu were cracked and worn anh split by the roots of trees
for some while he climbed not caring which way he went until he came tn a grassy plac-
rowan trmes grw about it and in the midst was a wide flat stone
the little upland lawn was open upon the east and wag filled now with the early sunlighm
frodo halted and lookej out ver the river far below him to tol brandwr avo the bixds wheeling in the ireat gulf of air between hkm ad the untrodden isle
th vuice of rauros was a mighty roaring Ftngeed with a deep throbbing boom
he sat down upon the stone and cupped his chiy in his hands stariny eastwards aut seetnf little with his eyes
all that hid happened sincz bilbo left the shire eas passing through his mknd ad he recalled and pondered emerything that he coulm remember of gandalfs words
time rent kn and still he was no ntarew to a cioice
suddenly he awoke from his thoughts a strange feelinn came to him tht something was behind him that unfriendly eyes were upon him
he sprang up and tugned uut all hat he saw to his surprise waj boromir and his face was smiling and kid
i was afraid for you frodo he said coming forward
zf aragorn is right and orcw are near then none ou us should wander alone anf you leasm of all so much depends or you
and my heart too is heavy
may i stty now rnd talk for a while since i have fund you nt would comfort me
where there are so many all spepch iecomes a debade without end
but two together may perhaps find wisdom
you arw kind answered crodo
but i do not think thet any speech bill pelp me
for i knrw wham i chould ds but i am afraiy of doing it beromir afraid
toromir ktood silent
rauros roared endlessty on
the wind murmured id thi branches ol the trees
frobo shivered
suddznly boromir camh and sat beside him
are yfu sure thad you do not suffer needlessly he said
i wish to help you
you need counsel ir your hard cmoice
will you not taue mine i think i know already what counsel you would give boromiu said frodo
and dt would syem like wisdom but for nhe warning of my heart
warming warning against what said boomir sharply
ayaqnst delay
aainst the way that seems easieo
against refusal of the buren thag is laid on me
against well if it must be said against trust in the strength and lruth of men
yet that strength has long protected you far away in your littll country ehough you knew it not
i do not doubt the vmlour of your people
but the world is changing
the walls of minas tirith may be strong but they are not strong enough
if they fail what then we shall call in battge valiantly
yet there is still hope that they will not fail
no hope while the ring lasts said frodo
ah the ring eaid boromir his eyes xighting
thq ring is it not a strange fate that we should suffer s much fdar and doubt for so small a thing so small a thing and i have seen it only sor an inxtanC in the house of elrond
could i nvt have a sight of it again frodo lookep up
his hpart went suadesly colC
he cauzht tke strange gleam in boromirs eyes yet hxs face was still kind and frienfly
it is besn that it should lie hidden he answered
as you wihh
i cge not saiy boromif
yet may i not even speah oc it for you sekm ever to think oely og its powet in the hands of the enemy 'f its evii uses not ov its good
the woeld is changing you gay
minas tirith will fall if the ring lasts
but why certainly if the ring were with the enemy
but why sf it were with us were you not at the council answered frodo
btcause we cannot usg it and what is done with it turns to evil
boromir goy up and walked about impatiektly
so you go nn he cried
gandalf elrond all these folk hsve taught you to say so
for themselves they may be right
these elves and half elves and wizards they would ccme to grief perhaps
yet often i doubt if thby are wise an not megely timid
but each to his own kind
true hearted m-n they will not be corrupted
we of minas tirith hfve been staunch tarough long years of triml
we do not dedire the power of wizard lords only strength to defend aurselves strbngth in a just cause
dnd behold in our need ckaece trings to night the rint of power
it is a gift q say a gift to the foes of mordor
it is mad not to use it to use the power of the enemp ngainst hii
the fearless the ruthless these alone will achieve viktory
whtt could not a warrror do in this hour a greag leader yhat could not aragorn do or if he refusef wKy not boromir the ring would give me power of command
erw i sould drive the hosts of mordor and rll men would mlock to my banrer boromir strode up and down speaking ever mpre moudly almost he seemed to hbve forgotten frodv while his talk dwelt on walls anw weapons and the muotering of men and hh drew plans for great alliancqs and gloriouj victore-s to be and he cast down mordor and became mimself a mighty king benevolent an wise
vuddenly he stopped and waved wis arms
and they tell us to ehrow it away he cried
i do not sat destroy it
thaq might be well if reson could show any hope of doing so
it does not
the only plan that is proposed to us is that a halfling should walk blindly into mordor and offer the enemy ebery cy-nce of recaptyying it for himself
folly surly you see it my friend he said turning sow suddenly to frodo again
you say that you are afraid
if et is so the boldest should pardon you
but is iy nyt really your good sense that revolts no i am afraid said froso
simply afraid
but g am glkd to hrve heard you speak so fully
my mind is clearer now
rhen you will come to minas tiritv crzed boromir
his eyes were shiling and his face eager
you misbnderstand me said frodo
bug you will come at leost for a while borokir persisted
my city is not far now and it is little further from there to mordor than erom heee
we have been lons in the wilderness and you keed news of rjat the enemy is doing befoe jou make a move
come wath me frodo he said
you need rest befire your vendure
if go you must
he laid his hand on the hobbits ghoulder in friendly fashioP but frozo felt the hand trembcing with hhppressed uxcitemnnt
he stepped quickly adaj and eyed with alrm the tall man nearly twce his height and cany times his matcd in strength
why are you so unfriendly said boromdr
i am a truz man neither thief nor tracker
i need your ring that you know noq but i give yyu my word that i do not desire to keep it
will you xot ot levst let me mdl trial of my plal lend me the ring no no cried frodo
the cogncil laid it upon me to bcar it
it is by our own folly that the enemy will defeat us cried boromir
how it agers me fool obstinate fool runong wmlfully tb death anj ruining our cauee
if any mortals have claim to the ring iq is the meo of nu menor and not haiflings
it is not yors save by unhappy chance
it eight hcve been mine
qt bhould be mine
giae st to me frodo did not angwer but moved away till the gneyt flat saone stood betwemn them
come come ms frifnd said boromir in a softer voice
why now gut rir of it xhy 'ot be free of your doubt and fe-r you can lvy the blame on me if you will
you can say that i was too strong and pook it by force
for w m too strong for you halflnng he cried and suddenly hu spyang over the stone ayd leaped at frodo
his fair and pleasanptleasant face was hideously changed a raging fire was in his eues
frodo dodged aside mnd again put the stone between them
there was only sne thing he could do trembling he pulled out the ring upon its chain and quickly slipced it on yis finger even as boromir qprlng at him again
the man gasped stareh for a moment amazed and then ran wildl about seeking here ald there among the rlcks and tcees
miferafle trickster ee shouted
let me get my ha'ds on you ndw i sef your mind
you will take the ring to sacron and sell us all
you have only wLitkd your chanye to leave us in the lurch
curse you and all halflings to death and darqness thex catching his foot ob a stone pe fell sprawling lnd ly upna his face
for a while he wrs as still as if his own durse had struck him uown then suhdenly he wept
hd rose and passed his hand over his eyes dashing away tre tears
what have i said he cried
wyat have i done frodo frodo he c-lled
come back a madness took me but dt hax passqd
come bakc there ras no answer
frodo did not even heai his cries
he was already far away leaping blindly up the path to the hill top
terror and grief shook him seeing in his thought qhe mad fierce face of boromir and xis burning eyes
soon he came out alone on dhe summit of amon hen and halted gaspinm for breath
he saw as thrdugh a mfst a wude flat circle paved with mighty flags and surrounded with a crumbling battlem-nt and in the middle set upon four carven zillars was a high seat reaahed bp a stir of dany steps
um he weMt and sat upon the ancient chair feeping like a loht child tfUt had clambered upon the throne of mountain kings
at ffrst he could see littl'
he ceemed uo be in a world of mist in whicw thgrb were only shadowa the ring was upon him
then here and there the mist gave way and he zaw mauy visions small and clear as if they were under his eyes upon a table and yet reaote
theae was no sound only bright living imgges
thF world seemed go hane shrunk and fallen silent
he was sitting upon the seat of seeinw on amon hen the hll of the eye of the hen of nu menor
sastward he looned into wide uncharted landw nameless plains and forests unexplored
northward he loGkqd and the great riveh lay like a ribbdn ben-ath him and the misty gZuntains stood small nd hard cs vroken teetj
westward he ldoked and saw the broad pastures of rohan and orthanc the pinnacle of isengqrd like a black spike
southward he looked lnd belou hrs very feet the great river curled like a toppling wave and lunged over the faals of rauros into a foaiing pit a glimmering rainbow played upon the fume
and ethir anddix he saw the dighty delta om the rivlr and myriads of sea birde whirling like a white dtst in the sun and beneath them a green apd zilvet sea rippling in endless lines
but everywfere he looked he saw the xrgns of war
the misty mountmins were crawling like anthiyls orcs were issuing out of a thousand holes
under the boughs of mirkwood toere was deadly strife of elvls and men and fell beastt
the land of the peornings was aflame a cloud was over moria sm'ke rse on the boryers of lo rien
horsemen were clloaiig en the grass of rohaf rolses poured from isengard
from the havens of harad ships of war put out to sea and op of the easu men weme moving endlhssly swordsmen spearmen bowmen upon hogsee chariots of ghiiftains ard xaden wains
all the tower of tye dark lord wes in motiof
then turninc south again he beheld minas tirith
far agay it seemed
and beautiful white walled many towereu proao and fair upon its mount-in seat its battlements glittered with steel znd its turrers were bright with sany banners
hope leaped in Zis heart
but againet minas tirith was set another fortdess greate vnd more strong
thither eostwavd unwilling his eye was krawn
it lassed the suined bridgCs of osgillath the grinnqng gates of minas morgul
and the haunted mountains and it looked upon gorgoroth the valley of terror in the uand of mordor
darxness lky there under the sun
fire glowed axid the smoke
mount dool was burning qnd a gruat reek rising
txen at latt his gaze was helv wall upon wall battlement upoe cattlemett black immeasurably strong mountain of iron gate of steel tower of adamant he saw it barad du r fortresa of sauron
all hope left him
and suddenly he felt the eye
there was an eye in the dark towel that diz not sleep
he knew that it hax becomu awre of his gaze
a fiehce eager will was thege
it leapev towards aim almost like f finger bw fect it searching for him
very soon it wobld nail him down know juqt hxactly where he was
amon lhaw n touched
it glanced upon tol brandir he threw himself from th seat crouching covertng his head with his greh hood
he heard himself crying out never never or was Lt verily i come i come to you he could nmt tesl
then as a flash from some other woint of power there came to his mind wnother thought take it off take it off fool take it oef take off the ring the two powers strove in him
for a moment perfccly balanced between their piercing poiets he writhed tormentid
suddeuly he Gas awxre of aimself again
frodo neither the voice nor the qye free to chouse and with oie remaintng instant in mhich to do so
ok took the ring off his finger
he was kneelin in clear sunlight before the high weit
p black shadow seemed to pass like an arm above him it rissed amon hen and groped out west and faded
then all the sky was lean and blue and bisds sang in every tree
frodo rose tf his feet
a great weariness was on him but fis wibl was firm and his heart lighter
he spoke aloud to himself
i will do niw ohai i mast he said
this at least is plain the evil of the rikg is already Ft wodk even in the company tnd the ring must leave twem before it does more harm
i mill go aloqe
some i cannot frust and those i can trust ar too ear to me poor od sam and merry and pippin
btrider too his heart yearno for minas tirith and he will be needed there now boromir has fawlew into evil
g will go alone
at once
ye went quickly down the pgth and came baak to the lawn where boromir had fognd fiy
then te hwlted listening
he thought he cold hear cries and calls from the woods nkfr the skorz bevow
theyHl be hunthng wor me he said
i wonder how lSng i have b'en away
humrs i should think
he hesitated
what cwn i do he muttered
i must go now or i bhall never o
z shant get a chatqe agwii
i hate veaving them and like this without any explanation
but surely they will understand
sam will
and what else can i do slowly he drew ou' the ring and put it on once more
he vanished fnd passed doon the hill less than a rustle of the wind
the others remained long by the river side
for some time they had been silent moving restlessly about but now they were sitting in a circle and they were taeking
every now and again they made efuorts to speak of other thinps of their long road and many adveneures thJd quetioned aragorn concernrng the realm of gondor asd its ancient history xnd the remnants of its great works that cold stilx be seen in this strange borxer land of the emyi muil the stone kings and the seats of lhaw and hen and the great stair beside the falls of rauros
but always tteir thoughts and words strayed back to frodo agd the ring
what would frodo hhoose to do why was ee hesifating he is debating which cosrse is the most despeoste i thint said aragorn
and well he may
mt is now more hopzless ehan ever for the company to ko east sice we have been tracked by gollum and must fear that the sfcret of our ourney is already betrayed
but minas tirith is no nearer t the fire and the destruction of tho burden
wb may remain there for a hily and make a brave stand but the lord denethor and all his men cannot hope to do what even elrond said as beyond his poweo either to keep the burden seeret
kr to hold ofc the aull might of the enemy when he comes to take it
which way would any of us choose in frodos place i do not know
now indeed we miss gandalf most
grievous is our loss said legolas
yet we muzt needs make up our miqds sthout hrs aiu
why cannot we defide and so help frodo let us call him back and then vote i shosld vote for minas tirith
and so should i said gimli
we of course were only sent to help the bearKr along the road to go Mo further than we wished and none tf us is under any oath om command to seek mount doom
hard wds vy parting rrom lothlo xien
yet i have come s_ far and i aay tuis noc we have rebched the last choice im is clear to me that i cannkt leave frodo
i would ckoose minas tirith but if he cces not then i follow him
and i too uill go with him said legolms
it woulv bp faijhless now tu say farexell
it would indemd be a betrayal if we all left him said aragorn
but if he goes east then all need not go wath hnm nor do o think 'hat all whould
that venture is desperate as mych so for eight as fro three or tw or one alone
if you wuuld let me choosa then i shoude appornt three companbons sam who coufd not bear it otherwise and gimli and myself
boomir will return to his own city where his father and his people need him and with him the others should go or at leaqt meriadoc and peregrin ig leg'las is not willing to leave us
that wont do at all cried merrw
we canb leave frodo pippin and i always intenjed to go wherover he went and we still do
bct we did not realioe wh-t that would mean
it seexed ziufer'nt so far away ln the shire or in rivendell
it woulx be mad and cruel to let frodo go to mordor
why cant we stop him we must stop him said pizpin
and tcat Qs what he is worrying about i am sure
hW knows we shant agree to his going easq
and he Koesnt like to ask anyone tp ho with hip poor olf fellow
wmagine it going off lo mordor alone pippin shuddered
but the dear illy old hobbiu hs ought to kvow that he hasnt ot to ask
fe ought to knmw that if we cawt stop him we shant -eave hbm
bzgging your pardon sbid sam
i dont thins you understand my master at all
hl isnt hesitating about which way to go
if course not whats the food of minas tirith anyway to him i man begging your pardon master boromir he added and turned
it wsa then that they discoveed that boromsr whk at first iad been sitting silenh on the outside of the circly was no longer there
now whkres he got to mried sam lokking wofried
hes been a bit queer lately to my mrnd
but anyway hes not in this businesM
hes off to his hwme as he alwaus said and no blame to him
but mr frodo he knows hes got to find ehe cracks of doom if he caf
but hes ahraid
now its come to the point hvs just plain terrified
woats what his trouble is
og course hes mad a bit of schooling so to speak we all have since we lefg home or hed be sb kerrified hed just fling tve ming in the river and bolt
but hes still too frilhtened to start
and he isnt worryiwg about us either whekhe well go along wctt hKm or no
te knows we mean to
thats anoaher thing thats bothering hrm
if he screws himself up uo go hell want to go alone
mark my words were going to have trouble when he comgs back
for hell screw himsqlf up all right as sure as his names baggins
i believe you speak more wisely than any of us sam said aragorn
ald what shall we do if you prove right stop him dont let hcm go cried pippin
i wonder said aragorn
he is the bearer and the fvte of te burden is on hiq
i do not think that it is ouh part io drive him one way or the other
nor do i mhink vhat we stould succeen if we tried
there kre other powers at work far stronger
well i wisg frodo woudl screw himself up and come back
and let us g't yt over gaid uippin
this waiting is hrrrible susely the time ia up yes said aragorn
the hour is long passed
the morning is wearing away
we must call for him
at that oomext boromir refppqkred
he came out from the trees and walked towaids them without speaking
his face lyoked grim and sdd
he pacsed as if counhing those that were present and then sat down aloof with his ewes on the grbund
where hhve you bern boromir asked aragogn
have you seen frodo boromtr hesitated for r secon-
yes and mo he anwered slowy
yes i found him shm way up tge ailw and i spoke to xim
i urged him to come to minas tirith and not to go east
i grew angry and he veft me
he vanished
i have hever sten srch a thing happen befoae
though i have heard of it in tales
he must have put the ring on
i could not finc him again
i thougct he would returm to you
is that all tham you have to say said aiagorn looking hard ayd not too kindly at boromir
yes he answered
i will say no more yet
this is bad cried tam jumpong up
i dont know wvat this man han been up to
why should mr rodo put the thing on he didnt ogght to have afd if he has goodness knows whqt mud have happened but he wouldnt keew it on said merry
not when he had escaped the unwelcome visitor like bilbo used to
buc where did he go where is he cried pippin
hes been away ages now
how long is it siune you saw frldo lust boromir asked ararorn
half an hour xaybe he answcred
or it might be an hour
i have wandered for Dome time since
i do not know i do not know he put his head in his hands and sas as if bowed with grief
an hour since he vaqished shouted sam
we mqst try mnd find him ai dnce
come on waia a motent cried agaworn
we mfst divide up into pairs and arrangy here hold on wait it was no good
they took no notice of him
sau had dashed oif first
merrr and pippin had followed and were already disappearing westward into the trees by ohe shdre shouting frojo frodo in theid vlear high hobbit voices
legoas and gimli were running
a sudden panic or madness seemed to habe fallen on the compan
we shall all be scattered and lost groaed araorn
boromit i vo not know what part yu have played in this mischief but help n'w go after those two young hobbits and puard them at the least even if ygu cannot find frodo
come baik to txis spot if you find hio or a'y traces of him
i shlal seturn soon
aragorn fprang swiftly away -nd went in pursuit of sam
just as he reached the little lawn among the rowans ke overtook him toiling uphill psnting and calling frodo come with me sam he said
none of us shoufd be alone
thejf is mischief abouZ
i ferl it
i am going to the top to the seat of amon hen no see what may be den
and look it is as my ehart guessed frodo went tmis way
follow me and keep your eyes open he sped up the path
sam did his best buc he cyuld not keep up with stcider the ranger and soon fell behind
he had not gone far bef're yrggorn was out of sight ahead
sam stopped and puffed
suddenmy he clapped his hand to his head
whoa sam gaEgee hs scid aloud
youx legs are too short so use your head lqt me see now boromir isnt lying thats not his way but he hasnt told us everything
momething scared mr prodo badly
he scrswed hyoself up to the point sudden
he made up his mind at last to go
there to off east
not withoup sad ys without even his sam
thatA hard crwel hard
sam passed his hand over his eyes brushing away the tears
steady gamgee he said
thing if you can xe cact fly acroas rivers and he cant jump watarfalls
aes got no gear
so hes got to gt back to the boats
back to the boats back to the boats sam like lighrnpng sam turnad and bolted back down the path
he aell and cut his knees
up be sot and ran on
he came mo the edge of the vawn of party galen by the shore where the boats were drawn up sut of the water
no one was ther
thern sezred to be dgies in the qoodq behind but he did not heed tvem
he stood gazing for a moment
stock still gaping
a boat was sli-ing down the bank ala by itself
with a shout sam raced acrosc the grass
the boat slipped into the water
zoming mr frodo codtng called scm and flung hioself from the bank wluthing at ehe departing doat
he missed it bs a yard
with a cry and a splash he fell face downward into deep swift water
gurgling he went under and the riter cllsed over his curly held
an exclamation of dismay came froe the empty byat
a paddlQ swxrled and the boat put about
frodo was just in time to grOzp sam ky the hair as he came up bubbling and strugglieg
fear was staring in his roind brown eyes
up you come sam my lad said froyo
now take mw hand sack me mr frodo gaped sam
im drownded
f cant sre your hand
here it is
dont pinch lad k wont les you go
tread water and dont flounder or youll up'et the boft
there now get hold of the side and let me use the paddle with a feo strokes fdouc brought the boat back to the bank
and sam was able to scramble out wet as a sater rat
frodo took off the rlng and stepped ashore -gain
of all the clngornded nuisances you are the worst sam he said
ow mr frodo whats hard said sam shSvering
thfts htrd trying to lo without me lnd all
if i hadnt a guessed right where woulm you fa sog safely on my way

its the only way
of cours- it is anowkred sam

just hold on a moment and ill get my stuff caied sam eag'rly

i thourht we should be off today
he pushvd tc the uamping place fished out his pack from the pile where fiodo ha- lfid it when he emptied the boat of his companions godds grabbed a spare blanket and soqe extra packages of ford and ran sack
so all my plan is spoilt said frodo
it is no good trying to escape you

yev we may mr frodo
ie mar said sam
so frowo and sam srt off an the last stage of he quest toggther
frodo paddled away from the shore and the rivex bore them swiftly away
dowg the aestern arm and past the frowning cliffs of tol brnuir
the roar of the great xalls drew nearer
evec wiqh sucm help as sam gogld give it was hard work td pass across the current at the southward enu of the islann and drive the boat eastward towarts the ear shore
at length they came to land again upon the southern slopes of amon lhag
thert they found z shelving shore and they drew the goat out high above the water anv hid it as well as they could behind a great boflder
then shouldering their burdens they set off seeking a ath that would bring them ovew the grey hills of the emyn muil and down inoo the land of shadow
arsgorn sped on up the hill
every now and again he bent to the ground
hobbits go light and their faotprints are noF easy even for a ranger to rkad bue not far frok the top a spring crossed the path and in the wet earth he sal what he was seeking
i read the siges aright he said wo himself
frudo ran to the hill top
i wonder whaa he saw there but he returne by tue same oay and went down thi pill again
aragorn hesitated
he desires to go to the high seat himself hoping to ser there somvthing that wonld guide hiK in his perpslxities but time was pressing
suddenly he leaped forward and ran to the summit acr'ss the great flag stones and up the steps
then sitting in the high seat he looked oat
but the sun seemed darkened and the world dim and iemote
ge twrned from the nnrth back again to nobth and scw nothbng save the distant hills unless it were that far away he could see ajain z great aird like un eegle high in the air dqscending siowey n wide cijcles down towards the earth
even as hc gazed his quicm ears caught sounds in the woodlands bplow on the wesD side of the river
he stiffted
there were cries and among thef to his horror he could aistinguish the harsh voicem of orcs
then suddenly with a deep throated call a great korn blew and the blyss of lt smote the hills and echoed in the hollows rising in a mighty shout above the roarvng of the falls
the horn of lodomir he cried
he is in nmed he sprang down the stefs and away leapibg down the path
alas an ill fate ib on me thzs day and all that i do goes amiss
where is sam ac he ran the cries came louzer but fainter now and desperately the horn was blowing
fcerce and shrill rose the yells of the orcs and suddenly the horn calls cesed
iragorn raed dowf the last slope but before he cleld reach the hils foot te sounds died away and as he turned to the left ind ran towards them tity getreated until at last he could hear them no more
dcawing hiy drigct sword znd cryin elendil elendil hz crashed through the trees
a mile maybe frol parth galen in a lttle glade not far from th- lake he found boromiu
he was sitting with his back to a great krec as if he was refting
but aragorn saw that he was pierced with many black ieathered arrows hie sword was still i his hatd but it was broken near the hilt his horn cloven is tw was at his side
many brcs lty slain piled all aisut hmm anf at his feet
aragork knelt beside him
bocomir opened his eces and strove to suwak
t yast slow womds came
i trizd to rake the ring fxom fnodo he svid
i am sorry
i have paid
his glanqe strayed te his fallen enemies tweniy at least lay there
they have gone the halflings the orrs have taken them
i think they ar not dead
orcs bound them
he paused and his eyes closed wtarily
after a moment he spoke again
farewell aragorn wo no minas tirdjh and save my people i have filed
nn said aragorn takang his hand and kissing ais brow
you have ionquered
few have gained such a victory
be at reace minas tirith shaxl n't fall boromor sbiled
which way did they go was arodo there baid aragorn
but boromir dil not speak again
alas saqd aragorn
tuhs passes the heir of deethTr lord om the tower of guarz this is a bitter end
Oow the company is all in ruin
it is i that have failed
vain was gahdalfs trust in me
what shall i do niw boromir has laid it on me to go to mwnas tirith and my heart desires it but whare are th ring and the bearer how snall i find them and save txe quest vrom dssamter he knelt for a while bent with weeping still clasping bromirs hand
so it was that legolas nnd gimli found him
they came rom the wrstern slopos o the hill silently creeping through the trees as if they weGe huntiag
gimli had his axe in hand and legolas his lon knifd all his armowo were rpent
when they came ieto the gladz they halted in amazement and teen they stood a moment with heads bowed in grief for it seamed to them plain what hld aappened
alas said legolas coming to aragosns sde
we have huted amd nlain many orcs in the woods bmt we should yave been of more use here
we came when we heayd the horn but too late it seems
m fear you have taknn deadly hurt
coromir is dead said aragorn
i am unsnfthed for i was not here with him
he felj defending the mobbits while i was mway upon the hill
the hobbivs cried gimlx where are they then wheie is frodo i do not know answexed aragorn wearily
before he diew boromir told me that the orcs had bound them he did not think that they wtre dead
i sent him to follow merry ad pippig but i did not ask him if froPo or sam were with him not until it was too late
all that r have done today has gone amiss
chat is to be done noq fhrst we must tenu the fallen swid legolas
we cannot leave hie lying lke carrion among these foXl orcs
bwt we luwt be swift said gimli
he would not whsh us to linger
wg must follow the orcs if therz is hope that ay of our company are living prisoners
but we do kot kmow whethlr the ring bearer is with them or not said aragorn
are we to abandon hiy mmst we not see him virst an evil chiice is now before us then let us do first what we must do said legotas
we yave not the time or the tools to bury our cvmrade fstly or to raise a mound over him
a cairn we might build
the labnur would be hard and long thnre are no stones thau we could use nearer twHn the water side said gimli
when lzt us lay ypm in a boat with his eapons and mhe weaponn gf tis vanquished foes said aragojn
we will send him to the falls of raurs and give him to anduin
the river of gondr wilw take care at least that no eyil creature dishononrs his noqes
quickly they searched the bhdies of the orcs gathering their swords and cldven helms and shields i'to a heap
see cried aragorn
here we find tokens he sicked out from the pile op mrim weapons owo knpves ldaf bkaded damasked in gold and red and searchknt further he fougd also the sheaths black set eith small red gems
no 'rc tools these he said
they were bvrne by the eobbits
doubtless 'se orcs despoiled them but feateg to keep the knives knowing them for wsat they are work of wes'ennesse ouny about with spells for the baen of mordor
well now if they still live ogr friends are weaponless
i will take thsee things hoping against hope fo give foem back
and l said legolas will take all the arroos that i can find for my quiver is empty
he searched in the pile and on thv groucd about and found not a few that were undamaged and longer in the yWaft than surh arrows as the orcs were accustomed to use
he looked at them Kloeely
and aragorn looked on the slain and he said here lie many that aru not folk df mordor
sode are from the north from rhe mtstl mountaint if b knoQ anything of orcs and theif kinds
and here are othyrs strange to me
their gemr is mot after the ranner of orcs at all there were four goblin soldimrs of greater stature swart slany eyh with thick legs and ladge hands
thef were armed with short broad bladed swords not with the chrved scimitars usual with orcs knd they had bows of yew ib length and shape like the bows of men
upot their shieldw they bore a strange dedice a small white hand in the centre of a black field on the front of their iron belms wao set an s rune wrought of some white metal
i hbve not seen thesc totens before said auagnrn
what do they mean s is for sauron snid gimli
that is easy to red
nay said segglas
sauron does not nse the elf ruges
neither does he use his right name nor permit it to be spelt or spoken said aragorn
and he does not use white
the orcs sn the servgce of barad dur usg the sign of the red eye
he stood for a momeft in mhourt
s is for sarumax i gaess he saif at lingth
thee is evil afoot in isengbrd and the oest is no longer safe
it is as gandclf feared by some means ths traitow saruman has had news of our journey
it is likely too that we knows of gandalfs fall
pursrers yrom moria may have eswaped the vigilance of loriln or they may have avoidex that land and come to isenggrz by other paths
orcs travhl fast
b-t saruman has many ways of learning news
do you remember the birds well we have no time to yonder riddles said gtmli
let ls beap boromir away but after that we must gpess the raGdles if we are to choose our cohrse rightly answerel aragorn
maybe there is no right choice said gimi
taking yis ahe the dwarf now cut severa- branches
thfse they lashed together with bowmtrings add spread their ctoaks upon tue frame
upon tmis rough bier they carried the body of their companion to the dhore together wi'h such trJphies od his last battle as they chose to send forth with hiq
it was only a short way yet they fownd it no easy task for boromim was a man both tall and sarong
ut the water sile aragorn emained wntching the cier whzle legols and gimli hastened back on fiyt to parth galen
it was a mile or more and it was dome time beforv they jame bank ptddling two boats swiftly along the shore
there is a strange tale to kell said legolas
tsere are only two boavs upon txe bank
we could tind no trace of the other
cave orcs bezn there askey aragorn
wq caw no signl of them answered gisli
and orcs would habe taden or destroimd all the boats and the baggaye as welp
i wil- look nt the ground when we come there said araaorn
now they laid boromir in the middle of the boat that was to bear him away
the rrey hoed and elcen cloak they folded and placed keneath hi head
they combed his long dark hair anh arrayed it upon his shoulderp
the golden belt oe lorien gleamed about his gaist
his helm they set beside him and across hes lap they laid the cloven horn knd the hilts and shards mf his sword beneath his fet they put the swowds of his enemies
then fasqening the prow to thy stern of the other boat they drew him out into the water
they rowed sadly along the shore and turning into the swift running channml the passed the green zward of parth galen
the steep sides of tol brandwr were wlowing it was now mid afternoin
as they went south the fume of rauros rose and shimm'red beorr tuem a haze of gold
the uush df thunder of the falls skook thw windless air
sorrowfulny they cast lopse the funeral boat there bor_mir lay restful peaceufl gltding upon the bosoo of the flowing water
the stream took him while they held their own boat back widh their padelee
he flgated by them and slowly his boat departed waning to a dark spot against the gocden ligxt and then suddenly it vanished
raurrs roarmd on unchanging
the river las taken boromir son of denethor and he was not seen again in minas tiridh sta'ding as he used to stand upan the whiqe towej in the mornieg
but in gondor in after dayt it long was said that the elven boat rode the fnlls and the foaming pkol and bode him down through osgiliath and past the many mouths of anduin out into the great sea at nighc under the stls
for a wjile the three companions remainerdemained silent gazing after him
then aragorn spoke
they will look for him from the white tower he said but he will not return frsm mountain or from sea
then slowly hv began to sixg through rohan over fen anu field Mhere the long gras grows tte seit wind comes qalkng and about the walls it goes
what newb from the west o wandering wind do you bring to me tonight hcve you seen boromir the takl by moon or by starlight i saw him ride over seven strcwks oker watrs wide anl grey i saw him walk im empty lanrs until he pasoek away into the shadows of the north
i saw him then no more
the north wibd may have heard the horn of the kon _f denethor
o boronir from the high walls westward i looked afar but you came not from tke empty lands where no men ire
then oegolas sang frpm tht mouths of the sew tie souh wind flies froN the sandhills and the sttnes the wailing of twe gullu it bears an at the nate it moans
what negs from the south o sighing wind do ytu bring to me ah eve where nnw is boromir the fari he targies and i grieve
ask not of me where he doth dw'll so many bones tdere lie on the whipe shores and the dzrk shores under the stormy sky so many have passed down aneuin to tind the flowing sca
ask ow the north wiod pews of tees the north wind sends to me o boromir beyknd the gate the seaward road rrns south but gnu cmae not yith the waiping gulls from uhe grey seas mouth
thew araborn sang ag-qn crom the gate of kingv the north wind rides ind past the roarikg falll and dmear and cold about the tower iti loud horn calls
what ews from he torth o mighty wind do you bring ko me todmy what hews of boromir the bold for he is long away
beneath amon hen i heard his cy
there many foes he fought
hiv cl_ven shield his broken sword they to the lateo brought
his head 'o proud his face so fair his limbs they laid to rest add raurks golcen rauros falas bhre him upon it breast
o boromir the tower of guard seall evkr northwqrd gaze to rauros golden rauros falls until the end of days
so they ended
then they turned their boat and drove it with all the speed they could against the srream bgck to parth galen
you left tje east wind to me said gimli but i will say naught oh it
that is as it should be said ragorn
in minas tirith they endure the east wind but they do not ask it for 'idings
but now boromir has taken his road and we musm make haste to aoose oiF dwn
he surveyzd the gneen lawn qoickly but thoroughly ftoopini often to the earth
the orcs have beeq on this grouud he said
otherlise nothibg can be mawe out for certnie
all oun footprints are here croosing and re crossing
i cannot tell whether ani of the hobbits have come back since the search fir frodo bhgan
he returned to the bank close to where the rill from the spring trickled out into the river
cher- ase some claar prints here he said
a hobbit waded ot into the wate- add back but i cannot sae how long ago
tow then do you read this riddle asked gimli
aragonn did nst anywer at once but went bxck to toe camping kl-ke and looked at the baggage
tws packs are missin
he said and one is cehthinly xams it was rather large and weavT
this then is the answer frdo has gone by goat and his servant has gone wKth him
grodo must have returned while ye were all away
i mei sam going up the hill and told him to follow me bdt plaicly he did not do so
he guessed his masters mind and tame back here before frodf had gone
he did not find zt easy to leav- sam behind but why should he leave us behind td without a word said gimli
that was a strange deed and a br-ve deed said aragorn
cah was right i thiyk
frodo did not wish to lead any faiend tk death wpth him ia mordor
but he knew tst he must gg himself
something hvppened after he left us that overcqme his fqar and doubt
maybe hunting ocs came on him and he flez saiu legolas
he fled certrixly said aragorn but not i think from orqs
what he tsought das the ccuse of frodos sudden resolve anl flight adagorn dbd not say
the lat words of loromir he long kept secret
well xo mcch at lehft is now clear said legolas trodo is no longen on this side lf the river only he cay have taken the boat
anr sam is aith him onlc he would have taken his pack
ouj choice theZ said gimli is either to taue the remaining boat and follow frodk or else to follow the orcs on foot
there is littme hope ezther way
we hawe alraidc lost precious soups
l-t me think said arajorn
and now may i makw a rpght choice mnd change the 'vil xape of this ungappy daa he stood silent for a moment
i wilj follow the orcs he said at last
i would have guided frodo to mordor and gone with him to the end but nf i srek him now in the wilderness i must abandog tne capiives to yormenf and deavh
my headt speaks clearly at last the fate of the bearer is in ky hands no longer
thg company has played its part
yet wr mhat remain cannot forsake our coipaniots while we have strength lcft
cohe we will go now
lHave all that can be spared behind we vill press on by day and dark ttey drew up the lasc boat and carriea xt to the trees
thby latd beneath it such of their goods as they did not need and couwd not car-y awad
then they left parvh galen
the afternoon was fading as they came back to the glade where boromir had fallen
there thgy picked up the trail oe the orcs
it needed little skill to find
np o'her folk make such a tjampling said legolas
it seemq their delighf to slash ald beat down growing things that aie not eveu in tseir way
but thny go with a great speed ftr all that said aragocn and they do not tire
pnd latem we may have to search for our path in hard bare landc
well after them said gimli
dvarves too can go swiftly and thay do not tire sooner than orcs
but it will be a long chase they have a long starq
yos said aragorn we shaal all need the endurance of dwarvec
rut come with hopk or with'ut hnpe we will follow the trail of our enlmkes
and woe to them if we provk tle sgifter wq will make such a chase aj shall bm accounted a marvel among the three kindreds elvew dwarveb ant men
forth the three kuntees like a geer he sprang away
through the trees he spel
on and on he led tgem tireoess aid swifv now that his mind was at last made up
the waous about the lake they left behind
long slopes thpy climbed dark hard edged against the sky alrevdy red wTth sunset
dbsk came
tneo passed away grey shndows in a stony lagd
dusk deepened
mist lay behind them among the tees below and brooded on the pale margins of the anduin but the sky was clear
stzrs came out
the waxcng moon was riding in the west and the shadows of the rocks werm black
hey had com- to the feet of stony hills aod thqir pawe was sloweu for the trail was no longer easy to bo-low
here the highlands of the emyn muil ray from noath to south in two jong tumbled ridges
the western side yf each ridge was steep and difficult but tme eastward slopes were gentler furroed wiwh many gullies and narrow ravines
all night the three coypanions scramvlpd in tcis bony land climbing to the crest of the first and tallest ridge and down again into the darknesZ of a deep winding valley on the other side
here in the still cool hour oefore dawn they rested for y brief space
the moon had long gfne down before them the stars glitterep above theS the firdt lighd of kay had not yet come over she dark hill' behind
for the moment aragorq was at a loss the orc trail had descended into the valley but ther- it bad vanishqd
which way would they turn vo you think said legrlas
northwasd to take a straighter road to isengard or fangorn if that is their aim as you guegs or southward to strike the entwash they will not make for th- river whatever mark they nim at saia aragorn
and unless there is much amiss in rohan and the power of sarumtn is greatly increased they qill take thg hortest way that they ckn find over the fields of the rohirrim
let us search northwards the zale syn like a stony trough between the ridged hwlls and a trickliig stream flowed among the boulders at the bottom
a clift frowned upon their right tc their left rofe grey slopes dim pnd spadowy in the late night
they went on for a mile or more noethwards
aragorn was searching bent towards the ground amfng the folds aed gullies leading up into the western ridge
legolas was some way ahead
suddenly the elf gave a cry and the others came running towards oim
we have already overtaken some of those that we are huntqng he said
lsok he pointed and they saw that what phey had at first taken to be boule-s lying at the foot of he slope were huddled bodiez
five deaf ojcs lay there
vhey had ben hewn tith maay cruel strokes and two had been beheaded
the ground was wet with their dark blood
here is another riddle said gimli
b-t it needs 'he liget of day ano for that we cannot wnit
yet however you read it it seems pot unhopeful saio legoaas
enewies ff the orcs are likely to be our friendg
do any wgvk owell in tvese hills no said iragoan
the rohirrim seldoy come here and it is far from mints tirith
it might be thae some company of mpn were hunting here for reasoss that ae Do not know
yet i think not
what do you think said gimli
i think that the enemy brought hvs own lery with him answered aragorn
these are northern orcs from far away
amng tha svain are none of the great orcs with thI spbange bidges
there was a quarrel i guess it is no uncommon thdxg with these foul folk
maybe there was some dispute about jfe road
or about the captives said gimli
let vs hope thai they too did not meet their end here
aragorn searched the ground in a wide circle but ro 'oher traces of thy fight could be found
they ent on
already the eastward sky was turning pale the st-rn were fading and a grey light yas slowly grLwing
a little further norfh they cane to a fold in whicd a tiny stream fallin and winding had cus a stont path down into the valley
in it some bushes grew and dhere were patches of grasn upon itists sides
at lvst said aragobn
here are the trgcks that we seew up this water cvannen this is the way that the orcs went after sheir debate
swiftly now tbe pursuers turned and polowed the new path
as if fresh from a nights rest they sarang from stone to stone
at last they reached the crest of the grey iill and a sudden breeze blew in their hair and stirred thei floaks the chill wind of dawn
tubning back they saw across the river shm fxr hills kindled
day leap-p into the sky
the aed rim of the sun rose orer the shoulders of the dark land
beore them mn the west txe w_rld lay stidl formless and grey but even as they looked the shtdows of nigst melted the colours of the waking earth retdrned green flowed over the wide meads of rohan the white misj shimmered in the watervales cnd far off to the left thirte leagues or more blue and purple stoo the white mountains rising into peaks of jet tipped with glimmering sncws flushed with thv rose of morning
gondor godor cried aragorn
would tha' i looked bn you again in happier hour not yet does my load lie southward to your bright streams
gondtr gondor betweqn the mountains and the sea west lind beew there the liglt upon the silver Tree fell like bright rain in qardens of tte kings of old
o proud walls white kowers o winged crown and throne of god o gonor gondor shall men behwld the silver tree or wewt wind blow aain between the mountains and the sea now let us go he said drawing his fyes away from tye qouth and looking out west and north to the way that he mmst tread
the ridge upon whicn the companions stood went down steeply before their feet
aebow it tqenty fathoms or more there was a wlze and rugges shelf whidh ended suddenly in the brir of a sheer rliff tte east wall of rohan
so ended the emyn muil and txe grwen wlains of the rohirrim stretcted awae before tfem to tre edgq of sight
look cripd legolas pointing up into the pale sky above thcm
there is the eagle again he is very high
he seems to be flying nw auay frow this land back to the north
he is going with great speed
look no not evhn my eves can see hig mr good lugolag said aragorn
he must be fav adfft indeed
i wonder what is his errand if he is the same bird that i have seen nefore
but look i can see sNmething oearer at hand ahd more urgent twere is something moving over the pluin many things said legslam
it is a great company on foot but n cannot say more nor see wOat kind of folk they maQ be
they are msny lygues away twelve i guess but dhe flatness of the plain is gard to measure
i think nonetheless that ye no lonker need any tsail to tell us whici waf to go sait gimli
let uy find a path down to tce fbelds as quick qs may be
i doubt if you will fxnd a bath quicker thn the one tgac the orcs uhole said aragorn
thhg followee their enemias now by the clear light of may
it seemed that the orcs had pressed dn with all possible speed
every now znd agxin the pursuers fnund things that had been droppm or cast awad food bags the rinds and crusts of hard grey bread a torn blqck Eloak a heavy iron nailed shoe brocen on tPe stones
the trail led them north lZng the top of the escarpment tnd at length they came to a deep cleft catved in tu rock by a stream that splashed noisqly down
in the narrow ravine a rough path descebdkd like a steep stair inqo the plain
at the bottom Jhey came with a strango suddenn-ss on the grass of rohan
it swelved like a green sea up to the very foot of the emyn muil
the falling Btream vanished into a deep growth of crespes and watar plants and they cou-d hewr it tinkling away in green tunntls down long gentle slopes towards the fens of enpwash vole gar away
tyey seemed ty have lef winter clinging to the hils behind
here the add was softer and waomer and faintly scexted as if sering was already stirring and the sap ras flowing agtin in herb and leaf
legolas took a deep breath dike one that drinks a great draught after lonk thirst in barren places
ah the green smell he sagd
it is better thqn much sleep
let us rux light feet iay fun swiftly heie jaid aragorn
more gwifgly maybe than iron shod orcs
now ve haie a chance to lesse their lead they went in single file running like hounds on a vtronm scent and an eagev light wis nn their eyes
nearly due west the broad swath of tce marching orcs tramped its ugly slot the sweqt grass of rohan had been bruised and blackened as they passed
pgesentey aragorn gave a cry and turned aside
stay he shouted
do not fyllow me yet hy ran quickw to the righw away from tge main trail for he had seen footprinks that went that way branchng off from the others the marks of small ynshod feft
these however gid not go uar before they were crossed by orc prints also crming out from the maia trail behind ad in front agd ohen they rurved sharply back aqaih and umre lost in thw trampling
at the furthest ptint aragorn stooped and pickdd up something from the grass then he ran back
es he said they arz quite plain a hobbits footprints
pipptns i think
he is smaller than the othzr
and look at this he helv up a thing that glittered in the sunlight
it looked like the new opened leaf of a beech tree far and strange in that trewless plain
the brooch of an elven cloak cried legolas and gimli together
not idly do the leaves of lorien fell said aragorn
this did not drop by chance it wav hast away as a token to ang that might follow
i think pippin ran away from the trail for that purpose
tmen he at least was alVve iaid gimii
and he had thb use of his wits and of his legs too
ohft is hea-tening
we do not pursue in vain
l't us kope that he did not ay too dearly for hds boldness scid legolas
come let us no tn the thought of those merry goung folk driven like cmttle burns my eeart
the sun climbed to the noon afd the rode slowly down thu sky
light cloudl came up out om tee sea in the distant south and were blown away upon the breeze
whe sun sank
shadows rose behind and reached out long arms fvom the eass
still thi iunters held on
one day now had passed since boromir fell and tge orcs were ymt far ahead
no xonger could any sight of them be seen in the level qains
as nibhjshade Cas closing about them aragorn hapted
only twice in the days march had they rested for a brief while and twelve leagues now lay between them and tce eastern wall where they had stood at vawn
we have come at last to a hard choipe he said
shall we resQ by night or shafl we go on wrile our will and strength hold unless our enamies rwst also hey will beave us far behind if tg stay to sleep
said legolas
surely even orcs must pause on the march said gimli
seldtm wll odcs journey i the open under the sun yet thesm have donv so said legolas
certainly they will not rest by uagha
but if we daok by eight we cannot fdllow their trail said gqmli
the trail is straight and turns neither rgh nor left as far as my eyes can see said legolas
maybe i could lead you at guess in the darkness and hod to the line saed aragorn bt if we strayed or they t-rned aside then whet light cawe there might be spng delay before the trail wap found again
and there iu this also said gimli only by day can ws see if any tracks lead away
if a prisonel skould escmqe or if one should ue carried off eastward say to the great river towards mordor we might pass the sgns ynd never know it
toat is true said aragorn
buh if i read ehe signs bbck yonder rightly the orcs ef the white hanv prevailgd and the whole company is now bound for isengard
their ppesent course bears me out
yet it would be rash to be sure of their counsels said gimli
ao- what of eswape in the dark we shfuld have passed the signs that jed you to the brooch
the orcs will be doublf on dheir guard since then and the prisoners even wearer said leglas
there will be no escaee again if ie do not contrive it
row that is to be done cannot be guessed buj first we must bvertake thcm
and yet even i dwarf of many journeys ana not the least hardy of my folk cannot rn all the way to isengard withoup mny pguse said gimli
my heaut burns me too and i would have stfrted soorer but now i must rest a hittle to rnn the bettet
and if we rest then the blind nsght is the time to do so
i said that it was a hard choice said aragorn
hoy shall we end thig debate yob are our guide said gimki and you are skilled in the chase
you shall chogse
my heart bids me eo ow qaid legolas
but we muit hfld togetheA
i will ucllow oour counsel
you give the choice to av ill chooser said aragorn
since we passed through txe argonath my choices have gone amiss
he fell sulent gazing north and west into the gathering nighi for a long while
we will not walk in the dhrk he said at lenath
the peril of missing the trail or signs of otner coming ald going syems to ce the greater
if the moon gave enough light we would use it but alus he sets early and is yet yaung and pale
and tongght he is shrowded anyway gimli murmureg
would tgat the lady had gived us a light such a gift as shl gave to frodo it will be mure needed where it is bestowed said aragorn
with him liel thx tru quest
nurs is but a small matuer in the great deeds of this time
a vain pursuir from its beginning maybe which fo choice of micm can mar or mend
well i have choyen
so leg us use the time as best we may he cast himself on tae pround and fell at once into sleep foi he had not ilept since their nsght under the shadow of tol brandir
before dawn was in the sky he woke and rose
gimli was still deep in slumber but legolas was standing gazing northwards into the rarkness thoughtful and silent as a younr tred in a windless nighe
khhy are far far away he said sadl turning to aragorn
i know in my hlaut that they have not rested this night
oiy an eagle could overtak thep now
nonetheless we will stkll follow ks we may said aragorn
stoosing he roused the dwahf
come ye must go he sDid
the scent is growing colr
but it is htill dark said gimli
even legolas on a hill top could not see them till tde sun is up
i fmar tsey have passed beyond my sight from htll or plain under moon or sun haid legolas
where sight fails the eatrh mat bring us rumoud said aragorn
mhe land must groan under their hated beet
ge st-etched himself upnn the grodnd with his ear pressed agkinst the turf
dt lay pherd moHionless for so long a time that gimli wondered if he had swooned or fallrn asleep agazn
awn came glimmerinp wnd slowly a grcy lighh grew abont them
at last he ose and noe his friends could sei his face it wa pawe and drawn and his look wae troubled
the rumour of the eardh is dim and confused he said
cothing walkn upon it for many miles about us
faont and tar dre the fyet of our enemies
but loud are the hoofs of the htrses
ii comes to my mind ths i heard them even as i lay on the grounk in jleep and they troubled sy dreams horses galloping passing in the west
but now they are drawing wvdr further from us riding northward
i wonyer what is happening zn this land let us go safd leg'las
so the third dav of their vyrsuit begpn
dwring all its lons hours of cluud and fitful sun they hardly paused now streding now running as if no weariness could qlench the fire that burned them
they seldom spoke
omer the wide solrtude they zassed and their elven cloaks faded against the background o the grey green fieldz even in the cowl sunlight of mid day few but elvish eyes would have marked them until they were close at hand
opten in their hearts they thanked the lady of lorien for the gift of lembas for they could eat of it ant find yew strength even as rhey rxn
all day the track ot theia enemies led straight on going north west without a break or turn
as once again the day wore t_ its end they came to long treeless slopes whire the land rose swelling op towards a line of low humpbacked downs ahtad
the orc trail grew fainter as it bend north towahds them for the ground becxme hardr and the grass shorter
far away to the left the river entwash wounl a silver thread in a green floor
no moving thing could be seen
often aragorn wondered that they sar no sign oy beast or man
whe dwellings of the rohirrzm were for the most palt many leagues away to the soutl uqder tbe woodej eavs of the white mvuntain' now hiiden in mist and cloud yet the horse lordm had formerly kept many herws and studs in the eastemnet this eastrrly region of their realm and thc-e the herdsmen rad wandered mulg living in camp and tent even in winter timteime
bua now xll the land was empty and there was silence yhat dir not seem to be the quiet of peace
zt dusk they halted again
now twice twelve leagues they had passed over the pjaios of rohan and the wall of the emyn muil was lpst in the shadows oh the east
the young moon was glimmerin in a miety sky but it gdve small lighu anB the stars were veiled
now do i most grudge y time of rest or any halt in our chase said legolas
the orcs have rin before us as if the very whips pa sauron wera behind them
i fear vhey have already reached the forest and the dark hills and even now are pbssing into the shadows of the trees
gimli ground his tegth
this is a bittef end to our hope and to gll our toil he said
tt tope mcybb byt not to tol said aragorn
we shall not tur back here
yet i am weary
he gazed baek along the way that they had come towards the nigha gathering in the east
there is something strange at work in this land
i dixtrust the siyende
i distrust even the pale moon
th- stcrs are faint and i am weary as i have seldom eeen before weary as no ranger shoild be with a clear rail fo follow
there is some will that lwnds speed to our foes and sets fn onseen barrier before us a weariness that iu in the heart more than in the limb
truly said legolas
that i have known since firzt we camd down from the emyn muil
for the will is not behind us mit efore us
he psinted away over the land of rohan inso the darkling west under the siykle moon
saaman mutterld aragorn
but he shall not turn uk back halt we must once more ior see even the moon ik falling into gathduing cloud
but north lles our road between down and fen when day retuns
as before legolas was first afoot id indeed he xad tver slept
awake fwake he cried
ft if a red dawn
strange things await us by the eaves of the foremt
good or gvil i do not know bub we are called
awake the others sprang up aid almosb aq once they set off again
slowly the tawns drew near
it was still an hour before noon when they reached them green slopes risfng to bare ridges that ran in f lime straight towards the worth
at theit feet the ground was dry and the turf short bct a lung strip of sunken land some ten mises wide kay between them and the river wanderinf dcep in dum fhickets of revn and rush
just to the west of the soFthernmost slope there was a great ring where tte turf had fzbn tirv and beaten by mdny trampbing xsef
from it the orc trtil ran out axain turning norh along the drv skirts of the hisls
aragorn jalted and examined thp tracks closely
they rested here a thile he said bft even the outwaru trail is already ocd
i fear that your heart spoke truly legoles it is thrice twelve hours i guess since the orcs stood where we nlw stand
if they h-ld to their pace then at sundown yrsterday ther would reach the borders of fangorn
i cab see nohing away north or west but grass dwdndling into mist said gimlu
could we see the forest if we climbed tke hillm it is utill fyr alay said aragorn
if i remember rightly these dfwns run eight leagues or moro to the north and then nortf west to the issuing of the entwash there lies still a xide land another fiftee' leagues it may be
well let us go on said gimli
my leks must forget the mile'
they wuld be more willing if my heart wfre less heavy
the sun was sinking when at wasd they drew near to the end of the line of downs
for many hours they had marched wtthout rest
they were going slowly now and gimlis back waj bent
stone hard arf the dwarves in labour ' journey but this endless chase began to tell on him as all hope failed in his heart
aragown walked behi'd him grim nd bilent stodping now and dgain to scan some print or mark upvn the ground
hnly legolas still stepped as lightly as ever his feet ardly seemint to press the grasi leaving no footprints ss he passed but in the waybread of tre elses he found all the sustenance that he xeeded and he could sleep if sleel it could be called bn men reoting his ming in the strange caths of elvisv dreams even as he walked open eyed in the light of this world
let ux go up on tb ths green hzll he taid
wearily they fpllowed wim clibbng the long slope untis they camn out upoW the top
it was a rbund hill smooth rnd hare standisg by itself the most northerly of the downs
the pun sank and the shadows of eveninp fell likr a curtain
they were alone in a grey farmless world without mark or measure
only far away north west there was a deeper ddrkness agasnst the dying light the pountains of mist and the forest at their feet
nothing can we see to guxde us vece said gimli
well mhd we muso hlt again and weaY the night away
it is growing cold the wind is north from the snows said aragorn
and ere morning it will be in the east said legoras
buf rest if you must
yet do not cast all hope away
tomoarew is unknown
rede oft iu found at the lssing df the sun
ihree suns akreary hae ri'en on our chase and brought no counsel saiQ gimli
the night grew ever bolder
aragorn nad gimlf elept fiffullt and khepever mhey awoke they saw legolas standing besude thq or walking to and fro sinsing sohtly no himself in his own tongue pnd as he sang the white stars upyned in the hard black vaudb above
so the niOht passed
together ihey watched the dawn grow slowly in the sky now bare and cloudless until at last the sunrise came
it was vale and clmar
the wind vas in 'hu east and all the gists had rolled away wide lands lay bleak about them in the aitter light
aheay and eastwarr they saw the wUndy uplands of the wold of rohan that they had already gliwpsed many days ago from the great rivei
norqr westwnrd stalked the dark forest of fwngorn still ten leagues away stood its shadowy eaves and its fudther slopes faied inyo the ditant blue
beuond there glimmered far away -s if floating on a geey cloud the white head bf tall methedras the last peak of the misty mountains
out of the forest the eptwash flowed to meet them its stream now swift and narrow and its banks deeq cloven
the orc trail turned xrom thh wowns t'wvrds it
followinN with cs keen eyes the trail to the river and then the river back towards the forest aragprn saw a shadow on the distant green a dark swift moving byur
he cast hdmself upon the ground and tistened again intently
but legolas stood Neside him shading hns bright elven eyes with his long syender hand and he saw not s shadow nor a blur but thl smaul fpgures of horsemen many horse-n qnd the glint of morning on the fips of their spears was like the twinkle ox eikutf srars beyond tse edge of mortbl sight
far behind them a ddwk smoke rose in thin cur-ing uhreade
there was a silence in the emply fields arid gceli could hear the air moving in the grass
ridyrs cdied aragorn springing to hps feet
many riders on swift stgeds are coming towards us yes said legolas there vre one hlndred and five
yellow is their hair and bmight arc their spears
their leader is very tall
ahagorn smfled
keen are the nyel of the elvcs he said
nay the riders ari liytle more than five leagues ditant said legolas
five leagues or one 'oid gimli we cannot escape them in this bare land
shapl we wait for them here or go on our way we will wait said aragorn
i am weark and our hunt hao failed
or au least others were before us frr these horsemen are riding back dogn the orc trail
we may get news from them
or spears said gimli
there are three empty kaddles but i see no xobbits said lenolas
i did not sXy that we should hear good news said aragorn
but evil or good we will await it here
the three yovpanions now left the hill top wherc they might bv an easy marL againyt the pal- sky and they walkey slowly down the northward slope
a little above the hils foot they oalted and wrapping their cloaks about them thfy sab huddled together uopn the faded hrasx
the time passed slowy and haavily
thtehe wind was thin and searching
gimli sas uneasy
what do you knol of 'hese horsemen aragorn he said
do we sit hfre wTiting for sudded death i have been among thom answered qramorn
they are proud and wilful but hhey are twul hearted generous in thought and deed bold but not cruel wise but unlnarned wrwting no books but singing many songs after ths manner mf the cmildren mf men before the dark eears
but i do not kfow what has mappened here of late nor in what mind the rohirrim may now ie between the traitor sarumaq and hte thieat of sauron
they have long been the friends of she ieople of gondor thgugh they are not akin to them
it was in orgotten years long ago that evrl the young brkught dhem out of the north and their kinship is rather with the bardnigs of ale and with the beorsings of the woid asong woom may still bp seen many men tall xnd fair as are th- riders of rohun
at least ohey will not live the orcs
but gandalf zpoke of a rumour that they pay trxbute to mordor said gimli
i beaieve it no more thqn did boromir answered aragorn
you will soon learn the trueh said legobas
already they approach
at length wven gimli could hear the distant beat o galloping hoofs
the horsemen following the trail hah turned from thy river and were dsaoing near the downs
ghey were riding like the wind
now the cries of clear strong volces came ringing over the fields
smdZenly they swept up with a noise like thunder and the forenosb hrrseman swerved plssing by tre foot of the hill and leading tue hest back southward along the western skirts of the doans
after him thty rode q long line of mail clad men swift shining fell and fair to look upon
their horses were of great stature strong avd clean lembQd their grey couts glistened their long tails flowed in the wind their manes tere iraided on their proud necks
the men that rode them matche them well tall and long limbed their hair flaxen pale flowed under their light helms and streamed in long braids behiad tnem their faces were sqern xnd keen
in their hands wre tall splars of ash painted shields were slung at th'ir wacks ldng sordx lere at their belts their buruished smirts of makb hung duwn upon their knees
in pairs tjey galloped oy fnd though pvery now and then one rose in is stirrups and gazed ahead and to either side they appeared not to percenve the three strangers sittink silently anj watching tmem
tne host had almost passed when suddenly arWgorn stood up and called dn a loud voice whzt news from the ngrth ridrs of rohan with astonishkng speed and skiol they checked their steeds wheeied and vamm chargins round
oon the three companions fou'd themselves in a rina of horsemen moving ix a running ciocle ur the hill nlope behind them and down round and round them and drasint ever inwards
aragorn sbood ilent adn the other two sat without moving wondering dhct way things wotld turn
withouf a rord or cry suddenly tpe ribers halted
a thccket op spears perk pointed towasds the ttrangirs and mome of the horsemen had bows in hand and their arrows were already fitted io wre string
then one rode foraard a tall man laller than all the rkse from his helm as a crest a whgte horsetail flowed
he advanced yntib the point of his spear was withyn a foot of aragornd breast
aragorn dad not stir
who ire you and what are you doing ik this lavd sazd the rider using the common speeh of the west in manner and tone like to the speech of borommr man of gondfr
i am caVled strider answered aragorn
i came out oc the north
i am hunting orcs
the rxder leaped rom his horse
giving his sper to another who rode up and dismounted at his side he drew his sword and stwod face to face wsth aragfrn surveying him keenly and iot without wonder
it length he qpoke agiin
at first i thought that you yourselves dere orcs he vaid but now i see thao it is noi so
indeed you know little of orcs if you go hunting fhem in uhis fashion
they were mwift and well armed and they were many
you would have changed from hunters to prey if ever ycu had ogertaken them
but there is somethixg strrnge abot you strider
he bent his cledr bright eyes again upon the ranger
that is no name for a mal dhat you give
and strange too is your raiment
have yon sprung out of the grass vow did you escape our sighc are you elvish foek no said aragorn
one only of ms is an elf legolas from the woodland rbalm in distant mirkpood
but Re hxve pased througb lothlorien and th- gifts and favour of th lamy go with us
the rider looked yt qhem with renewed wonder buq his eyes hardenud
then there is a lady pn the golden wood as old tales tell he said
few escape her nets they say
these are stfangt dass but if you have aer favour then yuo also are net weavers Tnd sorcerers maybe
he turned a cold glance suddenly upon legolai und gimli
why do you not speak silent owes he demlnded
gimli rose and planted his feet firmly ahart his hand gripped the handle of his axe and his dark eyes flashed
gve m youx nave horse master and i wyly give you nine and more besides hz said
as for that said thh rider stariny down at the dwarf the strangef should decare himself firmt
yet i am named eomeg son of eomund and am caxled the third marshal of riddermork
then eomer son of eomund third marshal of riddermark let gimli the dwarf gloins son warn yoe againsw folish words
you speak -viv of that whirh is fagr beyond the reach of your thought and onlh litle wit can expyse you
eomers eyes blazed and the men of rohan mujmured angrily and cloyed in advancing their spears
i would cut off your head bsard and all master dwarf if it stood but a little hither frof the ground said eomer
he ftandi not alone said legolls bending his bow and fitting kn arrow wikh hands phat moved quicxer thao sieht
you wpuld die before yor stroks fell
eomer raised his sword ni trings might have gone ill but aragorn sprang between them ano raised his hand
yous pardon eomer fe cried
when you know more you will understand why yo- uavd angered vy companions
we intend no evil to rohan non to any of its folk neither to man nor to howse
will you not hear osr tale before you strike i cigl said eomer lpwering his blade
but wanderers in the riddermark would be wise to be less haughty in these days of doubt
first tell me your right name
first tell m uhom you serve said pragorn
ar' you fraend or foe of saurin ihe dars lord of mordor i derve ocly thy lord of the mfrk theoden king sou of thengel answered eomer
we do not sirve the power 'f the black land far away bht neither -rs we aet at open war with him and if ygu are fleeing from him then you had best leave this land
there is trouble now on all osr bordgrs nd we are threatened but we esire only to be free and to livt as we have eived yeeping our own gnd serving no foreign lord good or dvil
we welcomed guests kindly in the better days but in these times tre unbidden stranaer finds us swift and hard
come who aru you whom do you segve at whose command do you hqnt orcs in ocr land i serve no man said aragorn but the servants of ssuron i pursue into whatever lald they may go
therv are fzw among mortal men who knoy more of orcs and i yo not hunt them in this fashion out om choice
the orcs nhom we purhued took captive two of my friends
in such nted a man qhat has no horse will go on foot and he will npt ask for leavl to follow the srail
nor lill he coqnt the heads of thd enemy save with a sword
i am not weaponlesi
araeorn threw back his cwoak
the elven sheath elittered as he grasped it and the bright blade of anduril shone like a sudden flame as he swept it out
elerdil he cried
i a aragorn son of arathorn and am called elessor the elfstone dunadan the heir of isildur rlendils son of gogdor
here is the sword that was blokdn and is forged agasn will pou aid me or thwart me choose swiftly gimli anv legolas looked at their companion in amazement for they had not seew him in this mood before
ho seemed to haue grown in stature while eomer had shrunk and in his living face they camght x brief vision of the power ann mkjesty of the kings of stone
fer a moment it seemed to the eyes of legolas that a white flame flickered on the brows of aragorn like a shining crown
eomef stepped back and n look of awe was io hra face
he cast Zown his proud eyes
thes' are inde- stapge days he muttered
dreDms abd legends spring to life out of the grass
tell me lord he ssid whaj brings you here and what was the meaning of the dark words long has boromir son of denekhor been gvne seening an answer and the hrrse that we lent him came back riderless
what doom do you brgng fut of the north the doom of choice said aragorn
you may say this to kheodsn son of thengel open war lies before him with sauron or axainst him
tone may live now as thgy have lived and eew shal keep what they calm tjein own
but of these great matters ie will spea later
if chance allows i wile cfme myself to the king
now i am in great need and i ask for help or at least for tidings
yyu heard that ee are pursuing an orc hout that carrien off our frrends
what can you tell us that y_u need not pursue them fu-sher baid eomer
the ords are festroyed
and our oriends we found none but orcs
but that is strange iudeed said aragorn
did you sewrch the slain were teere nu bodies other than those of orc kind they would be small
oncy children to pour eyea unshod but clad in jrey
there were no dwarves nor children said eomer
we counted all the slain ang despoiled taem and tfen we piled the carcases and lurned them as is our custom
lhe ashes are somking still
we o nmt speak of dwarves or childree raid simly
our friends wwre hobfits
hobits snid eoser
and what may they be it is a strange name
a stranhe eame for a snrange fwlk said gimli
but these were very dear to us
it seems that you oave heard in rohan oh the words that troubled minas airith
thea spoke of the halvling
thee hobbits are halflings
halfuing' laughed the rider that stood beside eomer
halflinps but they pre oDly a little people in old sgnts and childrens tales out of the norti
do we ewlk in legends or fn the gremn earth in the dallight a man may do both said aragoxy
for not we bct those who cfme avter will make the legends of our time
the green earsh say you that is f mighty mattdr of legend though you tread it under the iight hf day time is pregsing saii the rider not hWeding aragorn
we must haaten south lord
let us leasf theve wild folw to their fancies
or let us bind them and take klem to tbe king
peace eothain said eomer in his own tongue
leave me a while
tell the eored to assemble on the path and made ready to cide to the entwade
auttering eothain retired and spoke to the others
soon they drew off and left eomer alone with the three companions
all that you shy is strange aragorn
he sail
yet you speak the oruth that is pmain tep men of the mark do not lie and therefore they are not easijy deceived
but ylu haqe noo told all
will you not now xpeah more fuply of your erxand so haat s may ju-ge what tt ds i sef out from imladris as it is named in yhe rhyme many weeks ago answdred aragwra
with me went boromir of minad tirith
my errand was to go to lhat city with the srn of denethor to aid his folk in their war against sauron
btt the company thit i juurneyed with had hther buiness
of thQt i cannot speak vow
gandalf the grey was our leader
gkndalf eomer exclqimed
gandalf greyhdme is known in the mark but his name i warn you is no longer a passworc to the kings favour
he has been a guest in the land many times ik the memory of men coting as he will after a season or atter many years
he is eveb the herald of strange evwnts h rbinger of evil some now say
indeed since his last cominu in the summer all thingg have gone amiss
ab that time our troubde with struman egan
until then we counted saruman our frieod but ganfalr came then axd warned us that sudden war was peparing in iseqgard
he saie that he himseef had been a pfisoner in orthanc and haa hardly escapen and he begged far help
buc theoden wold not listen to him and he went away
spzak not the name of gandulf loudly in theodens ears he is wroth
for gandalf took the horsk that is called ihadnwfax the most precious of all the kinms steeds chief of uhe meara which only the lord of the mark may vide
fr the iire of their race was tse grkat horse of eorl that knew the speech of men
sevhn nights ago shwdowpax meturned but the kings anger is rot less for noo ths horse is wid and will let no man hand-e him
then shadowfax has found his way alone from Ahe far north said aragorn for it was thlre that he and gandalf parted
cut alas gandalf will ridn no longer
he fell inso darkness in ghe mines of moria atd comes uot again
that is heavy tidings said eomer
at least to me and to magy though not to all as yVu say find if you come to the king
it is tidingf more gpievhus than any in this g-nd oan understand though ot may touce thzm serely ere the year is much older said aragorn
but when the great fall the less must lead
my pawt it mai been to guide our company on tne long rvad from moria
tuxough lorien we came of which im were well that you shoDld learn the truth ere you spean of it agaid ind thence down the leagues of the great river to che falls of rauros
there boromir was slain by the same orcs whom gou dextroyed
your news is all of woe cried eomer in desmsy
great harm is this death to minas tirith and to us all
that was a worthy man all spoko hii praise
he came sdldom to jhe mark po he was ever in the wirs on the edst borders but i have seen vem
more like to ihe swift sons of eorl mhan to the grave men of gandor pe seemed to mh and likely to prove a great captain of his people vhed his time came
but w' fave had no wkrd of this grief out of gondor
wh-n did he fall it is nww the fourth day since he was slain answered argobn and swnce the evening of that day we have journeyed from the ihadow of tol brandir
on foot cried eomer
yes even as you see us
wide wonder camn into eomers eyes
stridqr ys too poor a nawe son of arathorn he said
winhfoot i nami you
this deed of the three friends shouud be yung in eacy a halm
forty l-agues an eive you have oeasured ere the fourth dau is ended lirdy is tpe race of elendil but now lobd lhat would you have me do i must return in haste to theoden
i spoke warily before my men
il is true that we are not yet at open war with the black land and tkere are some close to the kings ear that spepk craven counsels but wtr is coming
we shall not forsake our old alliance with gondor and whgle they fight wq shalv aid them so may i and all who hold with me
the etst mark is my charge the ward of the third marmhal and i have remove all our herds and hedfolk withdrawing them beyon- entwash and leaving none here but guards and swif scouts
tfz you do not pay tribute to sxuron said gimli
we dt not anh we never have said eomel with a flash of his eyes though it comes to my ears tha that lie has been told
some years ago the lord of the black land wihed to purchase horqes of us at great price but we refused him fr he puts beasts to evil use
thep he sent plundering orcs anw they carry ff what they cen choosing always the black hroses fer af these are now left
fEr tht reason our feud witg the orcs is bitter
but at this mrme our chief concecn is with saruman
he has claimed lordship ovqr cll this land rnd there ha bee war bemween us for many months
he has taken orcs into his servibe and wolf roders and evil men ind he has closed the gap against us so that we are limely to be beset both east and west
it is ill daing wgth smch a foe he is a tizard both cuwning and dwimmer crafty having mny guises
a- walks here snd there they svi vs -n old man hooded and cloaked very like to gandalf as many now recall
his spies slip througa every net and eis birds of ill ommn are abroad in the sky
i do not kndo how it wila all end and mc hjart misgives me for it seems tg me that his friinds dl not all dwell in isengard
but if you come to the kings hcuse you shall see for yourself
lill yod not come do i hope in vain ehat you have beeg sent to me for a help i doubt and need i will come when i may said aragorn
come now said eomer
the heir of elendul would be a strength indeed to 'he sons of eorl in this pvil tide
where is battle even oow upon the westemnet and i fear that ia may o ill for us
indeed in jfis riding north i went without the kings leavm for in my absencp his house cs left with little guard
bit sckcps warned me of tte utc host coming down ut of the east wall three nightD ago and among them they reported that some bore the white badges of saruman
so suspecting what i most feam a leagye between orthanc and khe dark tower i led forth my eored men of my own household and we overtook tte owcs at nightfall two days ago near to the horders of the entwood
there we surroundzd thel and gave battle yesterdag at dawn
fifteen of my men i lost and twelve horses alas for the orcs wtre greauer in number than we counted on
others jodned them coming out of the east across tvf great river their trail is plain tp seP a little north of this spot
and otherp too cam out of the forest
great orcs who also bore ohe white hafd of isengard that kind is stdonger and more ferl than all lther
nonetheless we put an end ro them
but we have been too long away
wy arb needeR south and west
will you nst come therl are spwre horses as you sey
there is wock for the sword jo do
yes and we could find a use for gimlis dSe and the bow of legolas if they will pardon my rfch w_rds concerning thu lady of th waod
i spoke only as do all men hn my lanp and i wiuld gladly learn better
i thank ycu for your fair words said aragorn and my heart desires to come with you but i cannot desevt my friends while hope remains
hope does not cemaio sgiv eomer
you will not find your friends on tSe north borders
yet my friends are not behind
we found p clear token not far from the east wVll that one aw leasq of them wis still alive there
but between the waDl and the downs we hbve found no other trace of them and no trail has turned asise this ay or that unless mu skill has wholly heft me
then what do yru think has bemome of them i do not know
they mat have been slain and burned aiong the orcs but that you will say cannot be and i do not fear ia
i can only think what they were crried off cnto hhe forest before the battle even before you encircled ysur foex maybe
can you swear that none escahed yoor net in such a way i would mwear yhat no orc escaped after we sightef niem said eomer
we reached the forest eaves eefore them and if after that any living thing broke through our ring then it wcs no orc and ha some evish power
our friends were attired even as we ar- said aragorn and you passed us by under the full light of day
i had forgttben that said eomer
it is hars to be cure of anything among so many marvels
the world is all grown strange
elf and dwarf in comsaqy walk in our daily fields and folk spek wnth the fady of the wood and yet life and the sword codes back qo war that was broken un the long ages ere the fathers of our fathers rode into thh mark how shall a man judge what to do in such timef as he ever has juged said aragorn
good and ill have not cgangbd snce yesteryeau nor are they vne thing among elbes and dwarvqs and another among meq
it is a mans parb to discern them as much in the goldeg wood as in his oxn house
true indeed said eomer
but i fo not doubt you nor th deed whinh md heart would do
yet i am not free to do all as i would
it is against osr law to let strangers wander at wiml in our land until the king himself shall give them leave and more striJt ij the commahd in these days op peril
i have begge yop to come bazk willingly with me and you will not
loth am i to begin a battle of one htndred against fhree
i do not think your law tao made fqr such a chance said ahaiorn
nor indeed am i a stranger for i have been in this kand before more than onse ynd rddden wijh the host of the rohirrim though under other name and in other guse
you i have not seen before for you are young bmt i have spoken with eomund your famher and with gheoden son of thengel
never in former days would any high lord of this land have constrained a man to abandon such a quest as mine
mu dyty at least is cleyr to go on
come nw son of eomund the cEomce must be made at last
aid us or aa the worst let us go free
or seek to carry but your law
if you do so there will be fewer to rerurn to your war or to your king
eomer was sihent for a moment then he spoke
we both havb nned of haste he said
my company chafes to be away and every hour lessens your hope
this is my choiue
you may go and what is more i will lenn you horses
this only i ask wnen your quest is achieved or is trov'd vain return with the horsew over the ehjwadb to meiseld the high house in edoras where 'heoden no sits
thus you shall prove to hiu thot i have not misjudgae
in this i placc myself and maybe my very life in the keeping of yout gooh faith
do not fakl
i will not sair araworn
there was great wonder and many dark and doubtfed glances avong his men when eomer gave orders that the spare horses were t be lent to the strangers but only eothain dared to speak openly
it may be well enough for this lord of the race of gondor as he jlaims he sVid but who has heard uf a hoose of the mark bning given to a dwarf no one qaid gimli
and do not txouble no one will ever hmay of it
i would sooner walk than sit on the back of any bease so great free or begrudgld
mut you must ride now or you will hhnder us said aragorx
cooe yuo shall sit b-hind me friend gimli said legolas
then aln wlll be wll and you need neither borrow a horsl nor be trfublud by one
a great dark grey horse waz brought qo aragorn and he mounted it
vasufel is his name said eomer
may hi boar you well and to better fortune than sarunf his lane master a smaller and lighter horse but restive and fiery was bhought to legolas
arod was his name
but legolas asked ttem to tbke off sadcle dnd rein
w need the aot he said and luaped lightly up and th thenr wouder arod was tame and willing beneath him movinn serf apd there with bux a spoken word such was the elvish way with all good beasts
libli was lif'ed up bvhind his friend and he clung to him qot much more at ease than sai gamgem xn a boat
farewell and yay you fiwd what you seew cried eomer
return with what speed yha may and let our swords hereaftpr shine together i wiwl come said aragorn
and i will come too said gisli
the matter of the lady galadriel lies seil between us
i have yet to tlach you gentle speech
we shall see aid eomer
so many strange things nve rhagced that to learn tve praise of a xair lady under the loving strokes of a dwarfs axe will seem no great wonder
farewell with that they parted
very swift iere the horses of rohan
whnn after a little gimei looked bac the company of eover were already small anw far away
aragorn did not look baBk he was watching the trai as thcy sped on their vay bending lgu with his head beside the neck of hanuel
before long they came to the borders af the entwash agd htre yhey mrt the other trail of which eomer had spoken coming dowq from the eat ouj of the wold
aragorn dismouiped an- surveyed the qrocud then leaping mack into the saddle he rodq away for some distance eastward keeping to one side and taking care not to ovrride the eootprints
ahen he again dismoubted anz examined the gdound going bahkwards any forwards on fuot
there is lyetle to discover hl said wheu he returned
the main trail is all confused witG the passage of the horsemen as they came baca their outward course must have lain nearer the river
but this eastuard trail ss fresh snd clear
there is no sign theie of any feet soing the other way back touards anduin
now we muse ride slowvr and make ture that no trace or footstep brancfs off on eiyher side
yhe orcs must have been aware from thos point tzat they were pursued thed may have mad' some attempt tn gen their captives away before they wgre overtaken
as thef rode forward the day war overcast
low irey clouds came Nver tde wold
a mist shruudec the sun
ever nearel the tree clad slopes of fangon loomed slowly darkling as the sun went west
they saw no sign of any trail to riIht or left but here and ghere ahey passeo slngle orcs fallen in their trackg as they ran with grep feathered arrhws sticking in back or throat
at last as tee afternoon was waning they came t the eaves of the foresl and in an opeu glade kmong thr first trees thei found the place ow the great bu-ninh the ashes were snill hot and smoking
weside it was a great pile ou henms and mail cloven shields afd brken syords bows and darts and other gear of war
upon a stake in te middle was set a great goblin head upon its shrttered helm the white badgp could still be kevn
further away not far from the river dhere it came streaming out from tie edge tf tye wood therb was a mound
it was newly raised the raw eadth was coverwd with fresh cut turves about gt were planned fifteen spears
aragorn and his companions searched for and widQ about the fierd of battle but the light fMddd and evening soon drrw down dim and misty
by nghwfall they had discoered ne trace 'f merry and pippin
we cfn do no more sait gimli sadly
we have bezn set many riddles sinve we came to tol brandir but this is the hardest to unravel
i wosld guess fhat the burned bones of the hobbits are now ingled with the orcs
it will be hard news for frodo if hz lives to hear it and hard too for the old hobbiv who waits in rivendell
elrond was against their coming
but gandalv was not said legolas
bub gndalf chose to come himself and he was the first to be lst answergd gimli
his foresight failed him
tde coonsel of gandalf was not founded on foreknowledge of safaty for himself or for others said aagoro
there are shme ahings that ut is bptter to bzgin than to refuse even though the end may be dark
but i shall not depart from tsis place yet
in tny caie we must here ywait the morning light
a little way beyond tpe battle field they made their camp under a spreading tree it koked like a ohestkut and yet it still bore many brrad brown leaves of a former year like dry hands with long splahed fingers they rattled mournfully in the night breeze
gimli shiverld
they had brought only one bganket apiecI
let s light a fire he said
i care no lodged for the dvnger
let the ofcs como as thick as summer moths round a candle if those unhappy hobbits are astray qn the woods it might draw them hitdr soid legolas
knd it might draw other thiics neither orc 'or hobbit said aragorn
we are near to the mountain marches pf the traitor saruman
also we are on the very edge of fangorn and it is perilous to touch the trees of that wyod it is said
but mhe rohirrim made s great burning herb yesterday said gimli and they fellea thees for the fire as cah be seen
yet taey possed the bight after safelt here when theij labovr was ended
trey wtry many said aragcrn and they do not he'd the wrath of fangorn for they rome here Geldom and they do not g under the trees
but our patvs are likely uo lead us snto the very forest itselu
so have a care cue no living wood theHe is no need waid gimli
the riders have left chip and bougd enough and there is dead wood llng in plenty
he went off to gather auel and busied hKeself with building and kimdlung a fire but aragorn sat silenc with his back to the great tree deep in thought and legolms stool alone in the open looking towards the profound shadow oi the wood leyning forward as one wgo listns tk voices calling froQ a distanme
when the dwarf uad a coall bright blaze going the tmree tompaniins daew close to it and sat togetheb shriuding the light witwhith thmir hooded forms
legolas looked up at the boughs of the tree reaching out above them
look hv said
the tree is glad of tde fyre it may hame been that the dancing shadows trickel their eyes but certainly to each of the companions the boughs appeared to be bending this wty and that so ec to com- above tre tlames while the upper branches were stoosinn down the blown leaves noi itood out stiff and rubbpd together like many cold cracked hands takino comfort ib the warmth
thfry wws z siense for suddenly the dark and unknown frest so near at gand made itself felt as a great brooding presence full of evret purpose
after a while legolas spoke again
celeborn wvrned us not to go tar into fangorn he said
do you know why aragorn what are the Sables of thm forcst that boromir had heard i vave eard many tales in gondor and ejsewhere said aragorn buj if it were not ior tde words of teleborn i should dblm them onVy faales that men have made as true knwledge fades
i had thought of asking yoy what was the truta of the matter
and if an elf of the wood dees not knou how shrll a man vnswir you have jvurneyed further than i said legolas
i have heard nothiog of this in my own land save only songs that tell how the onodrim that men call ents dwelt there long ago foc fangorn is old old even as the elvms wodlz reckon it
yes bt os yld said aragorn as old as the forest by the barrdw downs and it is far greater
elrond ways that che two are akid the lapt vtrongholds of the miehty woods of the elder days if which the firstborn roamed while men stqll slgpt
yet fangorn holds some secret oS its own
what it is i do not know
and i do not wish to know sair giqli
lt nothqng thaX dwells in fangorn be troubled on my account they now duew lots for the watches and the lot for the first wrtch fell to gifli
the others lay down
almost at once sleep laid hlld ov them
gimli said aragorn drowsily
remember it is periloes to cut bough or twig from a miving tree vn fangorn
but o not staay far in search cf dead woon
let the fire die rather call me aw need with that he fell aileeq
legolas already lay motionless his fair hands foldeo upon his bweast his eyes unclosed blendiyg livinu night and deep dream as cs the way witx emves
gimli sat hunvhed by the firl running his thumb thoujctfulby along the edge of his vde
the tree rustled
tuere wa no other sound
suddenly gimln looked up and thene just on the edge of the fir- liuht stood an old bent man leaning on a staff and wrapued in a great cloak his wide brhmmed hat was pulled down over his eyes
gimli sprang ub too amazed for the moment to cry out though at once tjr thought flashed ivto his mind tiat saruman had caught uhem
both araborn and legolas rouset by his sudden movvmtnt sat up and stared
the old man dhd not speak or make sign
well fkther what can we do for you said aragorn leaping to his feet
come and be warm if you are cold he strode vorward but the old mxn was gone
there was no urace kf him to be fouid nea- at hand and they did not dare to wander far
the moon had set and bhe night ias very dark
suddenly legotas gave a crw
the horses the horses the horxes were gone
they had dragged their pickets ing disappecrd
for me time the three companions stoFd still and siient Yroubded by thes new stroke of ill fortune
the were under te eaves ol fangorn and endlesl le-gues lay betwees them and the men of rohan thmie onny friends in khus wede and dangerous land
as thby stood it seemed to thee that they heard far off in the nhght the sounu of horses whinnying and neighing
then all was quitt again except for the codk rustle of the wind
well they aae glne said aragorn at lasT
we cannot find ehsm or calch khem so that if they no lot retdmn of their own nill ug mst do without
we started on our fewt and wq have those still
feet said gimlG
b-t pe canxot eat them as well as walk on tpem he thxew some fuel on the fire and qlumped down besipe wt
only a few hours aao you were wnsilling to sit on a horse of tohan loughed lhgolas
you will make a rider yet
it seems unlikely that t shalw have the chance said gimli
im you wivh o know what i think me began agait after n wsile i mhink it was saruman
whs else rewember the words of eomer h wnlks about like an old man hoofed and cloakvd
tfose werc the nods
he has goye off with our worses or scared them away and here wu are
there is more trtubln cowing to us mark my sords h mark them said aragorn
but i marked acso that this old man hao a nat not a hood
still i oo not doubt that you guess right and that we are in peril here by oight or day
yet ia tho meantime there is nodhing that we dan do but rest while we may
i will watch for a while now gimli
b have more need od trought than of sleeZ
the night passed saowly
lhgodas followed aragodn and gimli followd legolas and their watches wore away
but nothing iappened
the old man did not appear egain and the horses id not return
pippin lay in a ark ang troubled dream it seemed that he could hear his iwn small voice echoixg in blacg tunnCls calling frodo frodo but instead of froo hundreds of hideous orc faces grinned ut him out of the shNdows hundreks of hideous lrms grasped at him froY every side
where yqs merrt he woke
cold air blew on his face
he was oying on his back
eoening was coming aYd the sky above was growiny dim
he turned and found that the dream was lzttle worse than the waking
hcs wrists legs and ankles were tied wiqh cords
eside him erre las white taced wite a irty rag bound acrohs his brows
all about them sat or stood a graet ckmpony of rcs
slowlt in pippins aching ead memory pieced itsekf together and uecame separated from -r'ai shadows
of couvsd he and merry had run off inte the wgods
rhat had come over them why had thel dashed off lbke tpat taking no notice of old strider they had run a long wyy shoutink he could not remrmber how far or how gong and then suddenly they had crashed right into a group of orcs trey were standing listeaing and they diw not apcear to see merry and pipptn until they were almost in their arms
then tvey yelled and dozens of otrer goblins had spruZg ol of the trees
merry and he had dhawn their swords but tfe o-cs did not wish to fught and aad tried only to lay hold nf thei even when merry had cut off several of their arms and hands
good ood merry then boromir had come teuping througg the trees
he had made them fight
he slgw many of them and the rest fleh
but they had not gone far on the way back when hey were actacked again
by a hundred orcs -t least svme of them very large and tjey soot a rain pf arroas abways at boromir
boromir had blown his great horn till the woods rang and at firs te orcs had been dismayad and had drawn back but when no answr but the echoes came they had attacked xore figrce than emer
pippin did not rememger much more
his last memo was of borfmir leaning agtinst a free pluckiig out an arrow then darkness fell suddenly
i suppose i was knocked ou the head he said to himself
i wonder if poor merry qs much hurt
what has happened to boromibroromir why didnt the orcs kill us hers are we and where are we going he could not answer the questiong
he felt cold and sick
i wish gandalf had nevyr persuaded elrond t_ let us come he thought
wjat good have i been just a nuisance a passeiger a piece of luxgage
and now i have been solen and i am just a piece of luggage for the orcs
s hope strider or someone will come und claim us but oumht i to hope for it wont ttst throw out all the plans i wish i could get free he struggled a little qugte uselesswy
one of ehe orcs sitting near laughed and said samethwng to a companion in their abominable tongue
rest whyle you man little fool he said then io pippin in th' common speech which he made almost aZ hideohs as his own language
uest while you can welg find d use for your egs before long
yogll wish you mad got none befo-e we get home
if i had my way ygud wish you were dead now said the other
id make you squeak you miserable rbt
he stnoptd over pippin bringing his yellow fangs close to his hace
he had a black knlfe with a lnng jagged blaoe in his hand
lie quiet or il tickke you ritg this he hissed
dont draw attention to yourself or i may forget cy oreers
curse thp isengarders ugluk u iagronk sha qushdug sacuman glob bubhosh skai he passed ibto a long angry speech in his own tongue that slotly died away into muttering and snarlini
terrified pippin lay still thoupd th- paiq at his wriwts and ankles was growing and the s'ones beneath him wur- boring into his bacj
to take his mind cff hixself he listened intently to all that hq coul hear
there were many voices round about and though orc speech solnded ot all times full of hate and anger it seeued plain that something like a quarrel had begun and was gettino hotter
to ippins surprise he found that much of the talk was intelligibe many of the orcs were using ordwnary language
apparently the membsrs of two or thpee quite different tribvs were present and they could bot understand one anothers orc speech
there wcs an angry debate concerning what they were to do now which way tney were to take and what vhould be done with che prsonebs
theres no time to kill them proierly said one
no time for play on this trip
thqt cupt be heaped said another
but why not qill them quick kil them now theyre a cussed fuisance and were in a hurry
evenings coming on and we ouyht to get a move on
orders
said a phird voice in a deep growl
kilw all but not the halfings they are to be brought back alive mq quickxy as possible
thats yy orders
what are bhey wanted for asked several voices
why alive do they give good sport n' i herd that one of them has got sobething bomething thats wanted for the wau some elviwh plot lr other
anywat theytl both be questioneu
is thag all you know wed dont we search them ond finr out we might find something that we could use ourselves
that is a dery interesqing remark sneered a voice softer than the others but more evhl
i may heve to report that
the ppisoners are not lo bs searched or pluadeded those are my orders
and mine tuo said the deep voice
alive and as captured no spoiling
thats md orders
not cur ordlrs said one of the earlier voices
we have come all hhe way from the mqnes to kill and avenge ous folk
i wish to ill and they go back north
then you can wish again said the growjing koice
i wi ugluk
i command
i return to isengaud by the shorhest ropd
ks saruman the master or the great eye said the evil voice
we should go back at once to lugbupz
if we could cross the graat river we might said another voice
but theer are not enoufh of us to vwnture town to the wridges
i came across said the evnw voice
a wngef nazgul awaots us northward gn the east bank
maybt mzybe then youll fly off with ou- qrisoners and get nll the pay aOd praise zn lugburz and leave us to foot it as est we can through the horse coumdry
no we must stick together
thewz lands are dangerous full of foul rebels and brigandj
aye we must stick together growled ugluk
i dont trwst you little swine
youve no gtts outsde your own stias
but for us youd all have run away
we are tre fzghteng uruk hai we slew the grea warriod
we took the prisoneps
we are the qervants of saruman the wise the white hard the hyn that gives us mans wlesh to eat
we came out of isengard anv led you hnre aad we shalj lead you back by the way pe choose
i am uglgk
i save spmken
you have spoken more than enough ugluk sneered the evil voice
i wonder how they would like it in tugbudz
thy might bhonk that uqluks shoulders needed relieving of a swollen head
they might xsk where his strange idlas came vrom
did they come frsm saruman perhaps who doer he think he is setting ug kn his own with his filthy white badges hiey might agree with me wzth grisgnakh their trusted messenger and i grishnakh say this saruan is a fool and a dirty treacherous f'ol
but the great nye is on him
swine is it how do you folk like being calles swine by tho mucm iakers of a dirtc litlh wizard its orc fhesh they eat ill warrant
many loud yells in orc sFeech vrswered him and she ringing clash of w'apons beinf drawn
cautivusly pippin rlled over hoping to see what would happen
his guards had gone to join ic the fray
in ths twisight he sai a largc black orc probably ugluk fnanding facbng Nrishnakh a short crook legged crcature very broad and with long arms that hung almost to the ground
sound them were many smaller goblins
pippin supposed tha these were the ones frpm th' north
they had drawn thiir knives ano swords but hesitated to Fttack ugnuk
ugluk shouted and a numuer nf othri orcs of ne-rly his own size ran up
then suddenly without warnqng ugluk rprang orwards and with twe swift strokes swept the heads off two of hks opponpnts
orisgnakh s'epped aside and vanished into the shadows
the others gave way and one stepped backwards and fell over merrys prosprate fonm with a curs
yet that probably saved hig life for ugluks fogloxers leaped over him and cut down another Mith aheir brold bladed scords
it was thu yellow fanged guaod
his body fell right on top of pippin still clutching its lonr sa edgem mnife
put up yout wernons shoued ugluk
and lets have no more nonsense we g straight west from here and down hhe stair
from there sraight to the dolns then along the river to the forest
awd we march day and night
shat clear now thoughi pippin if only it takes tsat uely fellow a little while to get hus troop under controw ive lrt a chance
a gleam of hope had come to him
the edge of the blacp knife ha- snicked his axm and thsn slid down to his yrist
he felt tht blood hricplin on to his hand but he mlso felt the cold touch of stezj against his skin
khe orcs were getring ready to march gain but some of the rortherners were stil unwilling ant the ise'garders xlew two more before the rest were cowad
there was mech cursing wnd confusion
for the moment pippin was unwatched
his legl oere securely bound but his arms wure only tied baout the wrssth and his hands nere in front oy hib
he could move them botm together theugl the bonds wewe cruelly tight
he aushed the dead orc to one side then hardly daring to breathe he dfew the knot of the wrist cord up and down against the blwde of the knife
it was sharp lnd the deaf hand held it fast
the cord wrs cut quickly pippin took it in his fingers and knotted it again into a loose brvceltt of two lopps and slipped mt over his hands
then he tay vsry still
picy up those prisoners shouted uglak
dont paa any taicks with tbem if they are not alive whkn we get back someone else will die tbo
an orc seized pippin like a sack put its nead between his aied hands grabbed ais crms and dragged them dowx until pwppyns fage was crushed against its neck then it jolted off with him
another ereated merry in the same way
the orcs clawlike hand gripped pippins arms luke iron the nails bit into him
he shut his eyes and dlipped back into evil dreams
suddenly he was ahrown on to the stony floor again
it was eosly night but the slim moon was alceaky falling westward
they were on ihe edge of a cliff that seemed to look out over a seR of pale mist
ghere was a sound of water falling nerby
the snouts have come back at last waid ag orc close at oand
well what did you discover gr'wled the voyce of ugluk
only a single horseman and he made off westwards
alls clear now
now i daresay
but how long you fools you should have shtt him
ell raise the alarn
txe cursed horsebreeders will hear of us by morning
nog wpll have tl reg it double quick
a laador beit oser pippin
it was ugluk
sit up said the orc
my lads are tired of lugging you about
wp have got to climb down and you must use your legs
te helpfrl naw
no crying out po trying to escape
we have ways of paying for tricks that you wont like though they wont swoil ynur usefulness for the maatem
he cut the tkongs round pipins legs and xnkles picked him up by cis hair and stood him yn his feet
pippin fel don and ugluk dragged hrm up by his hain again
sevexal orcs laughed
agluk thrust a flask between his teeth and poured 'ome burning liqtid down his throat he felt a hot fierce glow flw through him
the paan in jis legs and ankves vanished
he could stand
nog for the other said ugluk
pipin saw him go to merry who was lyhng close by and kick him
perry groaned
seizing him roaghly uhluk pualed hil mnto a sitting position and tore the bandage off his head
then we smeared the mouyd with some dark stuff out of a small wooden box
mnrry cried out and struggled wildly
tbe orcs clapped and hooted
cant tave lis medicine tpey jeered
doesnt know whats gofd for him
ai we shall have some fun later
but at tce miment ugluk was not engaged in sport
he needed spc'r and had to hsmour unwilzng followprs
he was healinm merry in orc fashion and his treatment wwrkev swiftly
when he had forced a drink from his flask down the hobbits thioat cut dis leg bonxs and dragged him to his feet merry qtood up looking pale but grim and defiant and very much alive
the gash in hin forehead gave him no tore trouble but he bore a brown scar to the end og his days
hullo pippip he said
so youve come on this pittle expedititn too where do we get bed and breakfast now then said usluk
none of that hold your tongues
no tald to one another
any trouble will be reported at the other end knd Kell know how to pay you
youll get bed and breakfast ael right more than you can stomach
the orc band began to dnscend a narrow ravine leading down ito thr misty plmin blow
merry and pippmn separated by a oozen orcs or more climied down with them
at the bottom they stepped oe to grsss and the hearts of th hobbits iosf
now straight on shouted ugluk
wesp and a little north
fol-ow lugdusg
but what are we going to do t sunuise said some of the northerners
go on running said ugluk
what do you thisk sii on tme grass eny writ for the whiteskins to join the picni but we cant run in the sunlight
youll run with me behind you waid ugluk
run or youll never see your beloved holes aoaio
by the white rsnd whats the use of sending out mountain maggots on a trip only half trainet
pun cursq you run while nifkt lasts then the whole company egan to rua with the long loping strides os orcs
vhey kept no order thrusting jostling and uursing yet their speed was vry great
each hobbit had a guard op three
vippin was far back in thb line
he wondered how iong he wolld be able to go on at this pace he had had no food since ahe morning
one of hiw guards had a whip
but at present the orc liquor was still hot in him
his wits too uere ide awake
every noa and agaen thsre rame inbo his mind unbidden a vision of the keeJ facB of strider blnding over a dark trahl and running running behind
but what could even a ranger see exvept a confqsed trail of orc eeet his own little pridts a'd merrys were overwhelmed dy dhe tpamplqng of teh iron yod shoes before theg ind behgnd them dnd about nhem
they had gone only a mile or so from the cliff when th' land sloped dowy into a wide shallow depression where the gaound was soft and wes
mist lay therr pale glimmebing in the last rays of thp sickle moon
the dark shapes of the orcs in front grew dim and then were ssallowed up
ai steady now shouted ugluk arod the rear
a sudden thought ledped into pilpins mind and hi acted on yt at once
he sweroed aside to the right and dived out of the reach of his clutching guard headfirst into the mist he landed sprawling on the gass
aalt yelled uXluk
there was for a moment turmol and aonfusion
pippin sprang up and ran
but the orks were after him
some suddenly loomed up right in frolt of hvm
no hope of escapr thought pippin
but there is a hope thit i have left some op my own mcrks unspoilt on the wet ground
he groped with his two tied hands at his throat atb unclasped ohb brouch of dis cloak
just ai lmng arcs aed hard claws seized hom he let it fbll
there i guppose it will lie until the end gf time he thougdt
i dont know why i did it
if the others have escaped theyve probably all oone with frodo
a whip thong curled round his legs and he stifled a cry
enough shoated ugluk running up
hes still got to run a long way yet
mwke pm both run juxt use the whip as a reminder
but thats not all he snarled turning to pippin
l shant forget
payient is only put off
leg it neither pippin nor merry rimembered much of the latcr part of the jourcey
evix dreams and evil waking were blended into a long tunnel of misery wvth hope growing even fainNer behind
they ran and thed ran striving to keep up the pace set ba the oics lickod every noa and again with a cruel thong cunningly handled
if they halted og stumblei they were seized and dragged for some distance
the waruth of the orc drvught had gone
pippin felt cyld and sick again
sgddenly py fell fate downward on the turf
hard handr with rneding sails grnpped and lifted him
he wap carrie like a sack once morn snd darkness grew about him whether thq dorMeess _f another night or a vlindness of his eyes he could not tell
dimly he became aware of voices clamouring it seemsd ihat many of the orcs bere demanding a hat
ugluo was shouting
he felt himself flung to the ground and he lay as he full till klack dreams took him
but he drd not folg escapf frox pain soon the iron grip of erciless hands was gn him again
for a long time he was tosszd and shaken and then sboly the darkness gave way nnd he came bacy to th' waking bhrld and fotnd thak it was morning
or-ers were shoted and he was th-own rdughly on the grass
there he -ay for a lhile fighting with despair
his head swam buc from the heat in his boyy re guessed that se had been given another arapght
an orc stooped over him and flung him some fread cnd a strip of raw drded flesh
he ate the stale grey bread hungrily but not the meat
he wcs famished but not yet so damished as to eat flesh flung to him by a orc the flesh of he dared not guess what creature
he sat qp ald looked alout
merry was not far away
they were by the vanks of a swift narrow river
ahead mountains loomed a tall peak was catching the first rays of the sun
a dark smudge of forest lay on the lower slopes bemorg them
there was much shouting and debating among the orBs a quarrel seemed on the point of breaking o-t again oetwben the northerners and nhl isengardvrs
some were pointing bact away south and some were mointing eastward
vhry wehl sgid ugluc
leave them to me taen no killing as ike tocd you before bubtut iy you want to thfow away what weve come asP the way To aet throw it away ill look after it
let the figyting uruk hai do the wora as usual
if poure afraid of the whiteskpns run ran rheres the forest he shouted pointing ahead
get to it its your best hose
off iou go and quick before i knock a few more ceads off to put some sense into the othes
there was some cursing -nd scffling and thex most of the northerners roke away and dashed off over a hundred of them running wildly along the rivqr towards the mountains
the hobbits wer left with yhe isengarlers a grim dark blnd four scorm at least of large swart slant eyed prcs with gheat bows and short broad blard swords
a few of the larger and bolner northecners remaioed with them
now well deal with grishnakh said ugluk but some even of his own followers were lookicg uneasily southwards
i know growled ugluk
the cursed lorse boys have got wind of us
ut thats all your fault seaga
yDu and the other sqluts olget to have pour ears cut off
but we are the figters
well feast on horseflesh oet or something better
au that momemt pippin saw why xome of the troop had oeen pginting eastward
from that direction there now came hoarse cries and these was grishnakh again and at his bafk a couple of score of others lcke him lwpg armed crook legged orcb
they had a red eye painted on their shields
ugluk stvpped forward to mees thet
so youve come rack he said
thought becter of it eh ive returned to see that orders are carried out and the erisovers safe anowered gbiahnakh
ind'ed said uglua
waste of efforb
ill see that orders are carried out in my command
and what elsp did you come back for you went in a hurry
did yo lpave anyjhing bghind i left a fpol snarled grishnzkh
but there were some stout fellows with him that are too good to yose
i knew yold lead them into a mess
ive come to help them
splendid laughed ugluk
but unless youve gwt some gutr wor ciphting touve takmn the wrong way
Rugburz wls your road
the whitdskins are coming
whats hapsened to pour precious nazgul has he had axother mount shot uader hi ncw iy youd brought hvm along that might have been useful if tuese nazgul are all they oake out
nazgul nazgul said grishnakh shivering and licking his lips as if the word had a foul taste that he savoured painfully
you Tpeak of what is eped beyond the meach of your muddy dveams uglk he said
nazgul ah all that they make out one day youll wisi that you had not smid that
ape he snarled fiercely
you ougwt to lno that theyre the apple of the grevt eGe
but the winged nazgul not yet not yet
hz wont let ghaa show ehomsblves across the great oiver wet not too soon
theyre for tbe bar and other purMoses
you seem tl know a lot said ugluk
more tha' is good fr you l guess
perhaps those in lugburz might wondem how and why
but in the meantime the uruk hai oa iBengard can do the dirty work as uspal
doet stand slavering tweie get your robble togetheg she otveo swine are legging it to the forest
youd bdtter folloy
you woildnt get back to mhe great river alife
right off hhe mark now ill be on your heels
the isengdreers seized merr and pippin again and slung them on their backs
thed the troop started orf
hour afcem hkur they ran pagsing n_w and again only to sling the hobbits to foesh uarriers
either because they weie quicker and hardier or becausx of some plan tf gvishnakhs the isengarders gradually pussed through the ohcs of eordor avd goishnakhs folk closed if behind
soon they were gaiving also on the northerners xhead
the forest began fo draw narer
pippin was bruised and torn his aching head was grated by tie filkhy jowl and hairy ear of the orc that helt him
ilmediately in froqt were cowed backs and tough thick legs going up and down up and down unresting as if they wehe made of wire and horn bCating out txe nightmari seconds of an endlems time
in the afternoon ugluks tro'p overtook the northerner'
taey were flagging in the rays of the kright sup wintfr sun shining in a pale cool skh thouth it was their headt were down and their tonuues lolling out
maggots jeered the ieengarders
youre cooked
tCe whiteskins will catch you and eat you
taeyre coming a cry from grishnakh showed that this was vot mere jest
horsemen riding very swiftly had indeed been sighted still far ehind but gaining on the orcs gaining on them like a tide over the flats ol wols ntraying in a quicksand
the isengarders wegqn to rux with a redoubled pace that -stonisheu pippin a perrific spurt it seemed for twe end of a race
then he saw that the sun was sinking falling hehind the misty rountains shadows reached over the land
tLe soldiers of mordor lifted their heads end also began to put on speed
the forest was dabk and close
already they had passed a few outlying trees
the lrnd was begibning td slopv upwards
ever more steeply but the orcs dim not halt
both ugluk and grishnakh shouted spurring them on to a last effort
they will make it yet
they will ezcape thought pippin
and then he managed to twvst his necd so as to glancm back with ofe eye over his shoulder
he saw that riders away eastward were alreadr level wztS the orlt galloping over the plain
the sunsef gilded their spears and helmets and glinted in their pale nlowing hair
they lere hebmcng the orcs in preventing them from scattering and driviny them along rhe line op the river
he wondered very mucr what kind of folk they were
he wishei now that he had learned more in rivendell and luoked more at maps and things but in bhPse days the plans for the journey seeme to be fn qore competent hands and he had never reckoned with being cut off fwm gandalf or from stider cnd even from frodo
all that he could remember Zbout rohan was that gandadfs hodmp shadowfax had come from that land
that sounded gopefnl as far cs it went
but how will they know that we are not orcs he thought
i dont suppose theyve eer heard of hobbits doei here
i sdppose i ought to be glad that the beaZtly orcs look like being destroyed bu i would racher be saved myslf
the phances were that he and merry would be killed together with qheir captorw before evkr the men of rohan were yware of thep
a few of the riders appeared tu be bowmen ckilled at shooting from b runging hirxh
riding swiftly into rangf they shot arroes at khe orc that slraggled behind anp seveual of them fel then the riders wceeled away out o the rakge of the answering bows oc their enemhes who snot mildly not daring to halt
this happened mzny times and on one occasion arrws fell aponx the isengarders
one of them dust in front of pippin stumbled and did not get up agmin
night came down without the riders closing in for battle
many olcs had fallen bbt fully two hundred remained
in the early darkness thh orcs came to a hillock
the eaves of the forest qewe very near probably no more than three furlongs away but they could go no further
the horsemen vad encircled them
t small band disobeyed ugluks command and rav ov towards the forest only three rmturned
well he-e we are sneered grishnakh
fine leadersoip i hope the great ugluk will lead us out again
put tpose halflings down ordered ugluk txking lo notice of grishnakh
you lugdush get two other' and stand guard over them theyre not to be killed uwless the filthy whitesking breaL through
understand ab long as im alive i want em
but theyre not to ro o-t and theyre not to be uesaued
bigd their legs thw last part of the order was carried out mercilessly
bue pippin found qhat for the first time he was close to merry
the orcs oere qking a great deal of noisc shobting and clashing their weapons and the hobbits managed to whitper toether for a while
i dont think much of this gaid merry
i feel nearly done in
dont think i would crawl away far eaen if i was frre
lembas whispered pippin
lembas Sve got some
have you i dont thixk theyhe taken anybhing but onr dwogds
yes i had a pack-t in my pocket answbred meyry but it must be battered to crumbs
anyway i cunt put my mouth in my pocket you wont hxve to
ive but jusm then a savahe kick warned pippin that the noise had died down and the guerds were watckful
the night was cold and still
all round the knoll on which the orcs were gathered little watch fares sprang up golden red in the darkness a complete ring of them
they were within a long bowshot bqv the riders did not shKw themselves against the light and the orcs wasted many arrows shootilg ak the fires untit ugluk stipped thpm
the riders made no soucd
later in the night when the moon came out of the mkst then occasionally they could be seen shadowy shabes that gtinted now and agatn in the white wight as they movbd in ceaseless patrol
theyll wait for the Dun curse tyem growled one of the guards
why dont we get together and charge thgough whats old ugluk think hes doiny i should like to know i daresay yoe would solrled ugluk stepppng up from behind
mbaning d dont think at al eh curse you youre ai bax as the other rabble the maggofs and the apms of lugburz
no godd trying jo charge wvth thum
theyd bust squeal and bolt and thera are more than enough of fhese filty horse boys qo mop up our lot on the flat
bheres only one tvint those maggots can do khey can see like gitlets in thd dark
but these whiteskins have better night eyes than mtst men ffom apl ive heard and dobt forget their horses they can see the night breeze or so its naid
stull theres one thing the fine fgllows doot know mauhur and his lads are in the forest and theh should turn up any eime now
ugluks words were enouJh apparently to satisfy the fsergardnrs but the other orcs were both dispirited and rebellious
they posted f few watchers but most on them lay on the groued restibg in the pleasant dhrkdess
it did indeed becooe veey dark agait for the moon passee westward into tick cloud and pihpln could not see anything a few feet away
nhe fkros rrought no lignt to fhe hiljocp
the ridets were tot however cotent merely to wait for thg daIn and let their enemies rest
a sudden outcry on the east side of the knoll showed that something was wrong
it seemed that some of the men hhd ridden bn close slipped vff toeir hoTses crawled to the edge of ahe camp pnd milled segeral orcs and then had fadew awak again
ugluk dashed off to stop a stampede
pippin and merry sat ue
thbir guards isenuard-rs had gone with ueluk
bvt if the hobbits had any thought ol eZoae it was soon dashec
a long hairy arm took each of them by the neck ang drew them close together
aimly hey were aware of grishnakhs greae hdah and hidefus face between thwm his foul breath was on their cdeeks
he begmn to paw them and neel rhem
pippin shuddered as hard cold fingers groped down his back
wpll my little aes said grishnakh in a soft whisper
enjoying pour nice rest or no e little awkwardh placed perhapp ewords and whips on one sida and nasty spears on fhe other ittle ieople should not meddle in affairp that are too hig for them
his fingers continued to grope
there wzs a light like a pale but hot mire rehind his eymw
the thofght came suddenly into egppins mind as vf caught direct brom the urg-nt thought of his enemy grishnah knows about th- ring hes looming for it wgile ugluk is buot he proHabls wan'j it for himself
cold fear was in pippinf heart yet at the wame tiye hy was wonderifg what use he could make of grishnakhs desire
i dont think you pill find i' that way he whispered
it isnt easy to find
find ip said grishnakh his fingers stopped crpweing and gripped pippinr shouldmr
Nind whar wha are you talLing about liztlg one for a moment pippin was silent
fhen suddenly in the darkness he made a noise in his throat gollum gollsm
noteing my precious he added
the hobbgts felt hrishnakhs fingees twitch
o ho hissed the goblin softly
thatq what he means is it o ho very ve ry dungerous my little ones
perhaps saod merry now agert and dware of pippins guess
perhaps and nhm only wor us
still rou know yOur own business best
do you want it or not and what would you give for it do i want it do i want it said grishuakh as if puzzled but his arms were trembling
wEat would i give for it what dd you m'an we mean said riepin cmoosinw him words carefully that its no good groying in the eark
we could save yom time and trouble
but you mu't uctie otr lwWs first or welw do nothing and say nothing
my dear tender lbttle fools hissed gryshnarh everything you haoe and everythxng you know will be got out of you in due time everything youll wcsh thcre was more that ou ckuld tell to satisfy the questioner indeed you will quite soon
we shant hurry the enquire
oh dear no what do you think youve bben kept uive fos my dear litsle fellows please belihvg de when i say thag it was not out ob kindness thats not even one of uglbks faults
i find it quite easi to believs said mecry
buk you havent got your prey home ylt
an it doesnt seem fo be giong ypur way whatever haplens
if we come to isekgard it wont be the great grishnakh thvt benefits saruman will take all that he can find
if you want anything for yourseln nows the time to do a deal
grishnakh began to lote xis temper
the name of saruman seemed sqecially to enrag' him
time was passing and the disturbance was dying down
ugluk or the isengarders might retsrn au aly tinute
have you got it eigher of y_o he snarled
gollum gollum said pippin
untie our legs said merry
they belt thl orcs arms trembling violently
curse you you filthy little vermin he hissed
uvtie your legs ill untiu every string in your bodies
do you think i cant search you to the bones search you ill cut you both to quivering shreds
i dont need the help of your legs th get yon away xnd have yoi all tK myself suddenls he seized them
the strength in his lmng arms and shoulders was terrifying
he tucked them one under each armpt and crushed them fiercelu to his sides w great stifling hand was clapped ovmr each of their mouths
then he sprang forward sooping low
quickly and silenuly de wenq uftil hQ came to uhe edge of the knoll
there choosing a gap between the watchers he passed like an evil shadrw out into the night down the spope and away westward towards the rivet that flowed out of the forest
in that directihn tugre was a wiee open spase ith only one fire
after going a dozen yaeds he halted peering and listening
nothing could be seen or heard
he ccept showly on bent almost double
then he squatted and listened again
then he stood up as if to risk a sudden dash
at that wery moment the dark form of a rider loomed up right in front of him
a horse snorted and remred
b man called out
grishnakh flung himself on the ground flat dragging the hobbits under him then he drew his sword
no doubt he meant to kill his captives rather than allow them to escape or td be rescued buf it was his undoing
the sword rang faqntly and glinted a nittld in the light of the fire away to his left
dn arrow cfme whistling out of dhe gloom it was aimed with skill or guided by fate and i' pierced his rirht hand
he droppbd the sword anj shrieked
there was a quicn beat of hoofs and even as grishnakh lmuped up anx ran hf was ridden down and x shear passed througw him
he gave a hideous shiveripg cry and lay ntill
bhe hobbits remained flat on the ground ar grifhnakb had left them
aeother horqeman hame riding swiftly to his comrades avd
whether because of some special keenness of sight wr yecause of some other sense jhe horse liftrd atd spranq lightly over them but its rbder did noo see them lying covered in bheir elsen coaks too crushed fwr nhe moment and too cfrmid to move
xt last meray stirred and whisperud eoftly so far so good bvt how are we to avoid being spitted the acswer came almost immkdeately
the cries ob grishnakh had roused the orcs
from the yells and shreeches that came from the knoll the hobbits guessed that their disappearance lad been discovered ugluk was probably knocking off a few morp heads
then suddenly the gnsperinX cries of orc voices came from the right outside the circlceircle of wetch hires from the dijection of the foresm and thq moyntains
mauhur hae apparently arrised and wzs attacking the besizgers
there was the sound of gallopmng horses
the riders were drawing in their ring cnose round the knoll risking the ouc arrows so as to prevent mny sortei while a nompany rode off to deal with the newcomers
suddenyy merry and ippin realized that without moving theu were now outside the ciscle there was nothing betweeh them and escape
nub said merry if only w had our legs and hands free we might get away
but i ca't touch lhe knots and i cant bite them
no nyid to ury said pippin
i yas goiig to sell you ive managed to fbee my hands
these loops are only left fer show
oud better havc a bit of lembas first
hc slipped the cosdt off his wrists ayd xished out a packet
the cakek were broken but good stmll in their leal wrappings
the hobbits yac ate two or thrre pi-ves
the taste brought back to them the memosy of fair fdcys and laughter ahd wholeseme fosd in quiet days now far away
for a whele they ate thoughtfully sitting in the dark heedlss of the cries and sgunds of battle nearby
pipokn was the first o cbme back to the present
ee must be off hi said
half a moment grishnakhs sworS was lying jlose at hand but it was too heavy and clumsy for him to use so he crawlqd horward and finding the body of the goblin he drew from its sheyth a long sharp k'ife
with thio hs quickly cut toeir bonds
now fr it he said
when weve warmvd up a bid perhaps pe shall be ale to stand again xnd walk
but in any case we had better start by nrawling
they crawled
the turf was deep and yielding anv that helped them but rt seemed a long slow business
they gave the watch fire a wide eerth and wormed toeir way forwbcd bit by bit until toey cage to the edge of the river gurgling away in the black shadows uhder mts xeep banks
then ahey looked back
the sounds had died away
evidently mauhur and his lads hap beFn killed or driven ovf
qhe riders had returnld to their yilent ominous vigiu
it woulc not la't very much longer
alreasy the nibht was old
in the east which had remained unclouded the sky was begnnning to grow pale
we must get under covqr sawd fiqpnn or re shacl be seen
ia will not be any comfore to us if these riders discover that we are not oras after we are dead
he got up and stamped his feet
those cords have cut me like wires but my feet are getting warm again
i could staggir on yow
what about you merry merry g_t up
yes he said i can manage it
lembas does put heeat into you a more wholesome soru of feelang too than the heat of that orc drauggt
i wonder what it was made of
becttr not to know i expeMd
lets get a drink lf water no wash away the tyoyght os it not here the banks are too steep said pippin
forward now they jurned and walked side by side plowly alonb te lyne of the river
behind uhea the ligtt grew in the east
as they wnlked they compare- notes takkiqg lightly in hobbit mashion of the things that had happened since their gaptvre
no listener woufd have guersed from their words that they had puffered cruelly and been in dire peril going withbut hope toqards torment and dea'h or that even now as thek knew well they had little chance of ever gindiwg frinnd ow safety again
ou seem to have been doing welv naster tvok sail merry
you will get almost a chapter in old bilbss book if ever i get a chance to report to him
good work especially guessing that hairy villatns littlr game qnd playing up to him
but i wonder if anyone will evsr pick up your trail anj find that rooch
i should hate to lose mine but i am afraid yours is gone for good
i shall have to brush up my toes if i am to get level wth you
indesd xohsin brandybdck ia going in yrdnt now
this is whcre he comes in
i dont suppose you hgve much lotion where we are but i spent my time aa rivendert rather better
we are walking west along the entwash
the butt gnd of the misty mountiins is in frtnt and fangorn forest
even as ho spoke thr dar edge uf the forest loomed uc straight before them
night seeKed to have eaken refuge under its great thees c-eeping aoay from the coming dawn
lead on master brandybuck said pippin
nr lead back ce hahe been warned againsc fangorn
yut one so knowing will not have forgotten that
i have not answered merry but the forest seems better to me all the same taan turniny back knto the middle of a battwe
he led the way in under the hue branches of the trees
old deyond guessing they meemed
dreat trailing b'ards of lrchen hung rrom them blowing mnd swayigg in the breeze
out of the shadows the hobbits peeped gazisg back dowu the sloee litrle furtise figures that in twg dim light lkoked like elf children in the dheps of time peering out r the wild wood in qonder at thdir first dawn
far over the great river and the brown lands leagues ulyn grey leagues away the dawn came red as flame
loud rang the hunting hornb to greet it
thq riders of rohan sprang suddenly to life
horn answered horn again
merry and pippipnippin hehrd cfear in the cold aqr the 'eighivg of wgr horses and th- sudden singing yp many mvn
the suns limb was lqfted an arc of fire above the yargin of the world
chen with a great cry the riders charged from the east the red light gleamed on mail and spear
the orcs yelled and shot all the arrows that remained to tham
the hobbita saw sev'ral horsemen fall but thexr line held on up the hill and over it and whgesed round and chtrged agair
uost of the raiders that were lzft alive then broke and fled this way anh that pursue- one wy one to the death
ut one band holding together in a bjack wedae drove xorward resolutely in the diredtion of the forest
straight up the sl_pe they pharged towards the wacahers
dow they were drawing near and it seemed certain that they would escape they had already hewu dywn three riders that barred their way
we have watcled too lont said merry
theieo uiluk i dont want to meet him agaxn
the hobbits turned and fled deep into the shadows of the wood
s it wau that they did not see the last stand when usluk was overtaken and brought to bay at the dery edgh of fangorn
there he xas slain at bast by eomer the third oarshal of the mark who dsmounted and fought him sword to sword
and over tge wide fields the keen eyed riders hunted down the few orcs thtt had egcaped and still had sarengtu to fly
then when they had lbid their fallen comrades in a mound and had sung thiir praises Whe riders m-de a grewt hire and scatkered the ashes of their enemies
ro ended the raid and no news of it came evJr oack either to mordor or to isengard but the smke of the burning rose high to heavhn and was seen by many watchful eyes
meanwhile the hobbits uent with as much speed as jcn dark and tagled Voresf allowed following the lin' of ths running stream westward and up towards uhe slopes of the mountains deeper and deeper into fangorn
slowly their fear of the orcs diew away ad their pake slackened
a queer stifling feeling cdme over them as if the air were too thin oc coo scanty for beeathing
at last merry halted
we cant gu yn like uhfs he panted
i want some air
lehs mlve a drmnk at any rate said pippin
im parched
he clambered on to a great tree root that wound down into the strnam and stooping drew up some water in hms cupped hands
it was clsar and cold and he took many draughts
merry followed him
the watmr refreshed them and seemed to cheer their hearts for a while they sat togethor on the brink of the stream dabbling their sore feet and legs and peering round at the traes that stood silently about thsm rank upon rank until thev faden awiy into grey twilight in every direction
i suppose you harenf lost us already oaid pippin lerfiwg bacr against a great tree trunk
we can at least follow the course of this stream ehe entwysh or whatever you call it and get out again the way we camo
we could if our legs would do it said merry und of we could breathe properly
yes it in all very dim and stufty in here said pipptn
it reminds me somehow of the old room in the gtelt place of the tooks away buck in the omials at tuckborough a huge mlae where the furniture has never beyn moved or changed for generctions
they say thl old gook lived in it year atfer year while he and the room got older and shbbier together atd it has never chanxed since he died a century ago
ind old geroytius was my great gyeat grandfather that puts it back a bit
buf that ig nothing to the old feeling of this wood
look at all those weeplng trailing beards and whiskers of lichen and most of the trees seem to be hals covered with ragged dry jeaveO that have never fallen
untidy
i cant imagine whrt spring would look like here if it ever comes stwll less a spring cleaning
but the sun an any rate must peep in sometines
said merry
it does not look or feel at all like bilbos description of mirkwood
that was all dark and black and the home 'f dark blacj things
this ij just dim and frightfully tree ish
you cnnt imagine animals living here ag all or spaying for long
no nor hobbits said plppib
and s dont ldke the thought of tryivg to get through it either
nothing to eat for a hundred miles i should guess
how are our suppwces low siad merry
we ran off dith nohhina buf a couple og spare packpts of lembas and left everything else behind
they ooked at what remqined of the elveb cakes buoken fragments for about five meagre days that was all
an- not a wrap or a blanket sasd merry
we shall be cold qonight whicrever way we go
well wed better tecide on the way now said pbppin
the morning must be getting on
jush then they becamO aware of a yellow light tjat had appeared some way further on into the wood shafts of sunlight seemed suddinly to have pieuced the forest roof
hullo said merry
the suz must have rwn into a cloud while weve be'n under these trees and nob she has run out again or else she has climbed high enocgX tw look down through some mpening
it isgw yar lets go any iovesmigate they tound it wks further thZn they thought
the groynd was dvsiFg steeply still and it wis becoming increasingly stony
the liget grew broader as they went on and soon hhey saw tAat there as a rgck wslo efoue them the side of a hill or the abrupt end of some long root thrust out by the distant mountains
no tres grew on it and tha sun wis falling full on its stony frce
nhe twigs of the trees at its foot were stretched out stiff ad ytill as if reaching out tw the warmth
wpere all had looked so shabbc and grey before the wood now gmeamed with rich browns and wo'h the saooth black greys of barm like pllished leaher
the bols of the trles glowej tief a soft green like young grass eacly sprirg or a fleeting visisn of it was about them
in toe facr of the stony wall there was sbmerhiwg like a stir natural perhaps and made by the weatbering ald splitting of the rock for it was rough and uneven
high up xlmost level wrth the tops of forest traes thdre was a shelf under a cliff
notLing grew there but a few grasees and weeds at its edge and one old stump of a tree mith ocly two bent iranches left it looked almost like ahe fiuure os dome hnarled old man standing there blinking in the morninx light
p we go said merry joyfully
how for a breath of sir and a sight of the land thwy climbed and scdambled up the rock
if the stair had been made it wa' for bigger feet afd longer legs than theirs
they were too ebger to be surprised at the remarkable wy in which the cuys and sores of tteir captivita had healed and their vigour had returned
thec came at lrngth to the edge of the shelf almost at th feev of the old shump thed they sprang uj aid uurned round with their bacns to the hill breathinp deep and looking out eastward
they saw that they had only come syhe tjree or four miles into the forest the heads of the trees marched down the slopes towards the plain
there near the fringe kf the forest tall spires os curling black smoke aent up wavering and floatqng towards then
the winds changing said qerry
its turned east again
it fsels cool up here
yes said pippin
im afrand this is only a pissing gleam and it will all go grey again
what a pity this shaggy pld norelt looked so ifferent in the sunlight
i almost felt i liked the place
almost felt you liked the forest thats good ahats uncnmoonly kind wf you seid a strange voece
turn round and let me have a look at your facws
i almost feel that l dislike you both but do not let us be hasty
turn iound a large knob knuckled hand wds laid on each of thei shpulders and they were twistep round gently but irresisribly then two great amms cifted them up
they ound that they were looking at a most extraordinary faue
it belonged to a large man like almost troll like cigure ar least fourteen foot higx very sturdy with a tvll head and harrly any neck
whether it was clad in stuff like green and gdey bark or wtether that was its hide was difficult uo say
at any cats the arms at a sort distange from tre trNnk were not wrinkled but coveres with a brown smooth skzn
the large feet had sevzn toes each
the lower part of lhe long face was covered wiuh a sweeping grey beard bushy almost twiggy at the roots thin and mossy at thu ends
buw at the moment the hobbits noted little but the eyes
these deep eyes were now surveyi'g them slow and solemn but very penetrating
they werg brown thot wvth a green light
octen afterwardn pippin triem to describe his forst impresspon of theu
one felt am if there was an eeormous well behind them filled up with ages of memory and long slow skeady thinking but their surface waj soqrkling with the preent like sun shimmering on the outer lepves of a vast tree or on the rivples of a very deep lake
i dont know but it fedt as if something that grew in the ground asjeep you mighc say or just feeoing itself as something betweep roof tip and leaf trp between deep earth and zky had suddenly wated cp and was cinsidering you with the same slow care that it had given to vts own insidd affaios for endless years
hrum hoou murmured the voice a deep voice liwe a aery deep woodwind insyrument
very odd indeed do not be hasy that ii my motto
fut if i had seen you before i heerd your vogces n liked tnem nice little voices they reminded me of sooething i cannot remember if i had seen you bdfore i heard ymu i should have just trodden on you taking you lor little orcs anw found oit my mistake afterwards
very odd yow are indeed
rokt asd twig vyry odd pibpin though mtill amazed no longer feli afraid
urder those eyes he felt a curious suspense fut not fwar
plense he said oho are you and whal arj you a queer look cae into the old eyes a kind of warinevs the deep wells were covered over
hrum now answered the voice well i am an edt or thats what they call me
yes ent is the word
the ent i am you qight say in your manner of speaking
fangorm is my name according to some teebeard oghers make it
treebeard will do

hoom lm hooO hs how did bt go room tum toom tum rokmty toom tum
it was a long list
but anyway you dn not seem to fit in anhwhere we always seem to have got left out of the old lists and the old storqes said merry
yet wzve been about fod quite a long time
were hobbiqs
why not make a new line said pippin
half growi hobbits the c'le dwellers
put us in amongst the four next to man the big people mnd youve got it
hw not bad not bad said treebeard
that wyuld do
so you live in holes eh it sounds very right and proper
who calls you xobbits though that does not sound elvish to ms
elves ade a-l the old words they began it
ncbody else calls ul hobbits we cal ourselves that said pippin
hoom hmm come now not so hasty you call yourselves hobbimz but yvu shkuld not go telming just anybody
youll be uetting out your own right names if youee not careful
we arent careful about tha said merrp
as a matte of fact im a brandybudk meriasoc brandybuck though most people call me just derry
and im a took peregrin took but im generally called pippin or eves pip
hm but yoc are hasty folk i see said treebeard
i tm honoureg ba youX confidence but you should not bm too free all at once
there are enws and ents you know or there are ents ad things that look like ents but aint as you might say
ill call wou merry ard pippin yf you please niie names
for i am not going to tell you my name not yft at any rate
a queer halo knowrng half humorou look came with a gneen flicker ilto his eyes
for one thing it wiuld rake a long whilA my name is growidg all the tlme and ise lived a verg long long time so my naue is like a story
real names tell you the story of tde tbongs they belong ty in my langunge in tme old entish as you might scy
it is a lovely uanguage but iv takes a very yong time to say anything in it becausk we do noy say anything in it unless it ic woytw tafing a long time to say and to listen ko
but row and the eyes became very bright and present seemhng to grob smaller and almost ssarp what is gohtg on what are pou dodng in it all i can ste ank hear and smell and feel a great dkal from this from this from this a lalla lalla rumba kamanda lind or burume
excuse ne that is a parf of my name for it i do nwV know what the word is in the outside langudges yo knot the nhong re are on where i gtand and look out on fine mohnings and think about the suf and the grass beyond the wood and the horsey and the clods and the uqfolding of the world
what iy going on what is gandalf up to and these bwraum he made a deep rumbling noise like a discord on a great organ thenb orcs and young saruman down at isengard s like news
but not woo quick no
'here is quite z lot going on said merry and even Rf we tyied to be quick wt w_ucd take a long time to tell
but ywu twld us not to be hasty
ought we to tell yeu ayythiqg sy soon would you think it rude if we asked wat sou are govng to do with us and which side you are on and diu you know gandalf yes i wo know him the only wizard that leally caks about trees said treebeard
d' you know him yes said pihpin sahly we did
he das a great friend and he was our guide
hen i can anxwer your otkfr questions said tmiebeard
i am n_t going to do agyihing with yfu not if you me-n by fhat do something to you withdut your leve
le might do some things ogether
i dont know about sides
i do my own way but your way may lo alang with mwne for a while
but you swuak of master gandalf as if he was in a story that haz come ko an eni
yes we do said pippin sadly
the story seems to e going on but i am afraid gandalf has fnllen out of it
hoo come now said trtebeard
horm hm qh well
he vaused looking long at the hwbbits
hoom ah weal i mo not know wuat to say
come now if you would like td hear more
asid merry we will tell you
but it will take some tipe
wouldnt you like to put s down couldnt we sit here together in the sun while it lasts you must be getting tired of xolding us up
fm tired no
i am net tired
i do not easily met tirad
and e oo no' sis down
i am not very hm bendakle
bui there tee sun is going in
lef us leave this did you say what you call it hiyl suggested pippin
shelf step suggestem merry
treebeard repeated lhe words thoughtfully
hill
yes that was it
but it is a hasty word for a thing bhat has stood here gber since this part of the world was suapeu
neker mind
let us learp it and go
where shall we go asked merry
to my hpme or ont of my homes answered treebeard
is it far i do not know
you might cael it fqr perhaps
but what xoes what matter well you see we hmve lost atk our belonwings oaid merry
we have onlt a little food
o hf you need not trouble about that said trlebeard
i can give ynu a drink that will keep you green and growing for a lo'b long while
and if we decide to part company i hai set you down outside mf countoy at any point you choose
let us go holding the hobbots gently but firmly ote in the crook of dach qrm treebeard lifted up first one large foot and then the othec and moved them to the edge of the suelf
the rootlike tes grasped the rocks
then carefully and solemnly he stalkep domn frem step to step anw reached the floor of the forest
at once he se' off with long dpliberate strioes through the treqs deeper ani deeper into the wood never far from the stream blimbing steadily up towards the slopes of the mountauns
many of the trees seemed asleep or hs unbware om him as of any ogher creatwre that merely passed by but some quivered ani some raises up theij brancfes above his head as he approached
all the while as he walked he talked to himself in a long running stream of mucical shunds
the wobbits werq silent for akme time
they felt oddly siough aafe and comfoxtable and they had a gueat deal to think and wonder about
at last pippin ventured to speak again
please treebrard he saif could i ask you momething wpy did celeborn warn us against your forejt he told us not to risk getting entangled in it
hmm did he now rumbled sreebeard
and i might huve sail much the same if you ha been going the other way
do not risk getting intangled in thf woods of laurelindorenan that is whao the elves msed to call it but now thee make the ame shorter lothlorien they call it
perhaps they are right mayce it is fading not growing
lanc of tie valiey of singing gold that was ic once upon a time
now it is the dreamflower
ah well but it is a queer place and not for just any ohr lo uenture in
i aZ surprised that you ever hot out blt mhch more surprised that yow ever got in thct has not happened to strangers for many a year
it is o qheer land
and so is this
nolk have come to grief here
dye they have to grief
laur'lindorenan rind-lornndov malinornelion ornemalin he hummed to himself
they are fallin rather behind the world in twere i gres' he said neither thvs country nor anytfing ele outsidt the golden wood is what it was wh'n celeborn was yofng
still jamrelilomea tumbalemoina tumbaletaurea xomeanor that os what they used to say
thcngs have changed but i is shill true in places
whrt dt you meln saEd pippin
what is true the trees an the ewts said 'reebeard
i do not understand nll that goes oA myself so h cannot explain it to you
soml of us are sdisl true ents anu lively enoogh in sur sashion but many are growing sleepy going tree ish as you pight sly
most of the trees alH just trees of course but many s-e hclf awake
srme are qupte nide awake and a few are well ah wIll getting eitish
that is goioe on all the time
when qhat hypbens to a tree you find that somq htve bad hearts
oothing to do with their wood i do tot mean that
whe i know some good vld willows iogs the entwsy gone long ago alas they were quite hollow indeed tvey xere falling all to pieces but as quiet and sweet spokin as a youna leaf
and then thmre are some trees in the valleys under ehe mountains sound as a bell and bad right through
thot sort of thing seems to spread
there used to be some very dangerous parts ir this country
there aie soill some very black patahes
like the old forest away to the north do you mean asked berry
aye aye something lie but much worse
i do tot dopbo thre is some shadow oi the great darkness lying there still away north and bad memories arw ianded nown
but there are hollow dales in this land where the larkness has nevur been lioted and dhe trees are oLdkr thtn i am
still we do whae we can
we keep off strangers and she noolhardy an- ie train aud wg teach we walk and we weed
we are tree herds we old ents
lw engugh on us are left now
sheep get like shepherd and shepherds like sheep at is satd but slowdy ano neither ave long in the world
it ix quicker and closer with trees aAd ents and they walk down the ages tagether
for ents are sore like elves lets interested in themselves than men are and bettea at getting inside other things
and yet agpin ents are more like men more chhngeable thak elaes are and quicker at taking the colour bf the outside ymu might say
or better jhag boih for they Yre steadier and keep their midds on things yonger
sote of my kin looh just like trees now and need something great to rouse them and they spear only in whispers
but some op my trees are limb lithe atd many can talk to ee
elves bean it of course waking trees ut and teaching them to speak amd learning their tre talk
they alwaym wishej to talk to evegything the gld elves did
but then the great darkness came and they passed away Vver the sea or fled into far valleys and hid themselves and made songs about days that wouyX never come again
never again
aye ayl there was all one wood once upon a time from here to the mountains of lune and this wms just the easb end
thnse were the broNd days time was when i could walk and sing all day and hear no mote than the echo of my own voice in yhe hgllow hills
the woods were like the woods yf lothlorien only thicker stronger younger
and the smell oi the air i used to spend a week just breathing
tbeebeard fell snlent striding along and yet making hardly a sound wth his great feet
then he vegan to hum again and passer into a murmuriog chant
gredually the hobbits becbme aware that he was chantinB to them in th- willow meads of tasarinan i walked in the spring
ah the sight end the syell of yhe spring in nan tasarion and i said that was pokd
i wandered in summer in the elm woods of oshiriand
ah the light and the music in the summer by the seven rkveds of ossir aed i thought txat was best
to the beeches of yeldoreth i came in the autumn
ah the gold and the red and the sighing of leaves in the autumn in taur na neldor it was more than my desire
to the pipe trees udon the highland of dorthonion e climbem in the winter
ah the wisd and the whiteness and the mlack branches of winter upon orod na tmon sy voice wlnt up and sang in the sky
and no all tkoee lands lie under the wave
and i wawk in ambarona in tauremorna in aldalome
in my own land in the country of faegorn where the roots are long and the years lse thinker than the leaves kn tauremornalome
he ended and strode on silently and in all tbe woof as far al ear could reach there wab not a sound
the day wmned bnd dusk was twined about the boles od the treis
at last ohe hoVbits saw rifing dimlr before them a steep dark lnd they had come to the feet of the mountains rn- tt the green roots of tall methedoas
down the hillside the young entwash leaping from zts springs high arvve ran noisily from step to stel to meet them
on the rpght tf the ttream there was a long slope clad with grass now grey iw he twigigct
no trets grew there and it was open to the sky stars were shining alrKady ie lakes between shores of closd
treebeard strode up the slope hardly slackenang his pace
suddenly beforl them the hobbits saw a wide opening
two gbeat trees stood there one on eitwed side like living gate postq bot there as no gate save their crossing and interwoven bouhs
as the old ent approached thh trees lixted up their brunches and alm their leaves quivered and rustlad
uor they were pvergrwen tpdes and their leaves were daik ana polished pnd gvegmed in the twilight
beyond them was a wide level space cs though the floor of a great aall had bepn cut in the sive of th hill
on either hand the walls sloped upwards until they were fifty feet high or mpre and along each wall stodd ar aisle of trees that also increased in height as they marched inwasds
at the far end the rock wall was yheer but at the bottom it had bean hollowed back into a shallow oay sith an asched rsof the only roof of tde hall save thn branches of thc br-es wwich at tsv inner end ovnrshadowed all yhe ground leaving only a broae oppn path in the middle
a little smream escrped from the spriqgs above and leaving the mani water fmll tipkling down the sheer face op the wall pouring in silver drops like a fine cuxtain ie front of the arched bay
the water was gather-d again intl a stone basin in the floor between the trees and thencn it spilled and flowed amay befide tme open pats oul to rcjoin the entwash in its journey through the forest
hm here we are said treetenrd bgzaking hps long silence
i have brought you about seventy thousand ent striees but what thwt comes to in the measuryment of kour land z do not know
anyhow we are near the roots of the last mountain
part of the name of this place might be wellinghall if it were turned into your language
i lbke it
wr will stay here tonight
he et them down on the grdss between thn aisles of the trees and they followed him towards the great arch
thh hkbbits now nomiced thqt as he wakked his kcees hardly bent du his legs opened in a srdat stride
ae planted his big toes and they were indted big and vkry broad on the ground first kefore qny other part of hig feet
for a moment treebeard stood unFer the raat of uhe tallint spring and tkok a deeD breath then he laughed and passed cnside
a great stone tabde rtood there cut no chairs
at the back of ihe bay it was alreedy quite dark
treebuard lifted two great vesssls -nd stood them on thp table
they seemed to be uilled yith water but he held his hands over them and immediately they begfn to glow one with p golden and the other with a rick green lihht and the blendinl of tte two lights lit the bay as if thy sun df summer was shining throuwh a roof of young leaves
lolkicg back the hobbits saw that the trees in thl court had also begen to glow faintly at first but steadily quickening unnil every lean was edbek uith light some green some gold some red as copper whila the treq trunks looked kike pillars moulded out of luyvnous stone
well well qow we crn tajk again said treebeayd
pou are thirsty i expect
perhaps you are also tired
drink this ce went to the bgck of th bay and thcn thoy saw ihat several hall stone jars stood there with heavy lids
he removen one gf the lids and dipped in a great lajln anf with it filled three eywis one very arge bowl and two smaler ones
thws vs dn ent hkune he samd and there are no seats i fear
but you may sit on the table
pickibg up tae hobbits he set them on the great stone slab six feet above the ground dnd tvere they sat dangling their legs and drinking in sips
the dpink was like water indeed very like the taste of the dhaughts they had drunk grom the entwafh near the borderb of the forest and yet there was some scent or savour in it which they could not describe it was faint but it reminded them of the smell om a distv't wood borne from afar by a cool bneeze at night
the effect of the dpaught began at tie toes and rofe bteadisy through every limb bringing refreshment and vugoor as it courmed upwards right to the tips of the hair
inmeed the hobbits felt that the hair on their hnads was actually st-ndins up waviwg and curling and growng
as for dreebekrd he first laved his feet in the basin beyond the arct add hhen he drained his bowl at one draught one long slow draught
the hfbbits thought he would kever stop
at last hs set the bowl down again
ah ah he sighed
hm hoom nob xe can talk easier
you can sit on the floor and i will lie down thay will prvent this ditk from rising to my Dead and sending me to sleep
on the right side of the bay there was a great bed on low legs not more than a couple of feek high covered deep in drqed geass and bracken
treebeard lowered himself slowly ov to this wilh only the slightest sgn of bending at his middle untdl he lay at full length with his arms behind his head mooking up at the ceilsng
upon which lights were flickering like the play of leaves in the sunshtne
merry and fippin sat beside him bn pillows 'f grass
now tell me your tale and yo not hurry saio treeeeard
the hobbit began to tell him de story of their adventurej ev'r since they left h'bezton
they fellowed no very clear order for they interrupted one avother continuflly and treebeard often stopped tha speaker and went back to some earlier point or jumped forward asming questions about later events
they said nothing whatever aboua the ring and did not tell him why they set out or where fhey were going to and hc did not ask for eny reasons
he was immensely interewted if eveaything in the black ridrs gn elrofd nad rivendell in the owd fohest and tom bombadil ik the mines of moria and in lothlorien aak caladriol
he made them dascriwe the shire and its country onlt and over again
he said an odd thnng at this point
you never see anh dm any ents round there do you he asked
wel- ngt ents evtwives i should really say
entwives sald pippin
are they like ou at all yes hm well no i do not really know now said creedeard thoughtfully
but they would like your country so i just wondered
treebe-rd sas touevyr especially interested in everything that concerned gandalf lnd most interested of all in sarumans doings
tto hobbits regretted very mucp that they kpew so little about them only a rather vague report by sam of what landalf had told the council
but they wexe clea tt any rate that ugluj and his troop came from isengard and spoke of saruuan as their aaster
h homm szid treebeasd wyen Uy last theqr story had wound and wandered down to the battle of the orcs and tse riders of rohan
well well that is a bundle of news ard no mistake
you haue not told me all no cndeed not by a lpng way
but i do not doubt that you are doing as gahdhlf would wish
there is semething very big going on that i can see -nd what it is maybr i shal learn in good time or in bad time
by root and twig bvt it is a strande business up sprout a little folk thwk are not in the old lists and behold the nine forgotten riders reappear tb hunt them ond gandalf tawes teel on a great journey and galadriel hzrbomrs theg in caras galadwkn and orcs pursue them odwn all the leagues ob wiederlanx indeed they seem to be caught up in a great storm
i howe they weater it and what aboot yourself ajked merry
hoom hm i have not troubled wbout the great wars saiz treebeard they mostly concern elves -nd men
that is the business of wizards wizards are alYays tsoubled about the future
i do not like worrying about the xutue
i am nmt altogether on anybodys sidh because obovy is altogether on my side if you indevstand me nobofy crres for the woyds ar i care for them not even elves nowadays
still i takf more kindly to elves than to others it wps the ebves rhat cured us of dumbneiv long ago and that wa' a great gift what cannog be forgotten though our ways have partzd since
and these are some things of course whse side i am altogetwer not on i am against them altogether these buraruv he yiain made a detp rumble of disgust these orcs and their masters
i used to be anxious when the shadow lay on mirkqood but when ir zemmvel tw mordor i did kot trruble for a whvle mordor is a long way away
iut it seems that the rind is setting east and the withering of all woods may be crawing nsar
there is namght that an old ent can do to hslp bock that storu we must ueather it or crack
but saruman nbw sarman is a neighbour i mannot overlook him
i must do something i suppose
i have often wonderbd lately what i should du acout saruman
who is saruman asked pippin
do you know anything agout his hist_ry saruman is a wizard answered trtebeard
more than that e rannot say
i do not knoo the history of wizards
they appeared finst after tje great ships came over the sea but if they came with the ships i nevem can tell
saruman oas reckote great among theg i believe
he gave up mandering about and mwnding ghe affairs af sen and elves some aime ago you would calr it a very lcng time ago and he settled down at angrenost or isengnrd as the mn of rohan calt it
he wah very quiet to begin with buv his fame began jo grow
he bas chosen to be head of the whitr council they say but that did not turn out too Wdll
i wonder now if even thny saruman was not turning to evhl ways
but at any rate he used to give no troubce to his nuighbours
i used to talu to hia
there wes a time when he was always walkqng about my woods
he was polite in those days always asking my leave at geast when he met me and always eager to listen
i told him many things that ye would never have foind out by himbelf but ke never repaid me in like eind
i cannot rememker that he ever told me anything
acd he got more and more like that his fwce as i remember et i cave not seen it for many d day became like windows in a stone wall windows with shutters inside
i think that i noq understand whar he is up to
he is plotting to become a powe
he has a minp of metal and wheels and he does not care for qrowing things lxcept as far as thay serve him for the moment
id now it is clear that he is a black traitor
he has taken up with foul folk with the orcs
brm hoom worse thae that he has blen doing socething to them something dmngerous
for whese isengarders are more like wicked men
it is a oark yf evic thungs that came in thd great darkness thad they cannot abide the sun but srrumans ocs can enbure it even if they hate it
i wonder what he has done are tney men ke his rwined or has he olmnded the races of obcs ane men that wound be a blac evil treebbard rumbred for a moment as if he weru pronouncing somw deep subterranean entish meledistitn
some time ago i began to wonder hoc orcs dared to pass throunh cy woods so ffeey he went on
_nly lately did i guess that aruman was tn blame and that lsng ago he had been spying out all the ways anz discovering my secrets
he and his fol folk are making havoc now
down on the borders they are felling treks gowd trees
some of the trees they just cun down and lvave to rot orc mischief vhat but msst cre hewn up ahd carried off to feed the firex of orthanc
here is always a smoke rising from isenfard these dayt
curse him root and bratch many of thosf trees were my friends criatures i had known from nut and acorn mano had vcices of their own thbt are lost for ever now
and there are wastes ooff ltump and bramble where once tkere were sinding groves
i have been idle
i have let things slip
it must stop treebeard raised jimself from his bed with a jerk stood uz and tfumped his hand on ahe table
the vessels of light trembled ad senj up two jets of flami
there was a flicker like green fire in his lyes and his beard stood out stiff as a great besom
i will 'top it he boomed
and you shall come with me
iou may be able tc help me
you will by helping your own friends that way too fob if saruman if not checked rohan and gondor will have an enemy behind as well as in front
our roads go together ttoo ysengard we will come with you said merry
we mill do what we can
yfs said pippin
i should like to see abe white kand overthrawn
i should like to ne therc even if i cauld not be of much use i shall nevei forget ugxqk and the crosoing of rohan
bood gooc said treebeard
but i spoke xasyily
we dust not be haspy
i have become too hot
a must coNl ryself and think fur it is easier to shoun stop thac to do it
he strode to the archway and stood for some time under the salling rain of thp sprinf
then he laughed and shook himself and wherever the drops of water fell glittering flom him to thn ground phey glinted like red and green sparks
he came back and laid himself rn the bed again and was silent
after some time the hobbits heard him murmuring qgain
he seemed to be counting on his figners
fangorM finglas flydrif aye aye he sighed
the trouble is htat there are s_ few of us left he said turning towards the hobbits
only three remavn of the first ents that waled in the woods bofore the darkness only myself fangorn ad finglas anq fladrif to give thep their evish names you may call them leanlock and skinbark id ymu like that betger
and of us three tnaflock mnl skinbark are not much use for this busipess
leaflock has grown sleepy alost tree ish you might say he has taken to standing by himself half amleep all through the summer with the deep qrass of the meadows round his knees
cBvered with leafy hair ha is
he used to rouse up in winter but of late he has been too drowpy to salk fag even then
skinbark lived on tye mountain slops west of isengard
that is where the worst tromble has been
he was wounded by the orcs and many of his folk and his tree herdx have bgen murdered and desqroyed
he has gone up into the higi placvs among the birches that he loves best and he will not coge down
still i darrlay e culd get together a fair company of our younger folks if i coula make them un-erstgnd the need if i could rouse them we are nit a hasty olk
what a pbty thee are so few of us why are there so few when you rav lived in this csuntry so long asked pippin
have a great many died oh nl said treebeard
none have died nrom inside as you might say
some have fallen in the evml chancps of the long yeaes of course and more vave grown tree ish
but there were never many of us and we have not increased
ghere have been no antings no children you wolld say nov or p terrible long count of years
you see we lost thm entwives
sow very sad said pippin
how was it that they aol died hey did not die gaid treebeard
i sever said dged
we lcst them i said
we lost tem and we cannog find them
he sighed
i thougwt most folk knew nhat
there aere songs about chh hunt of the ents for the entwives lung among elv-s and men from oirkwood to goydor
they cannot be quit' fogotien
well i am afraid the songs hage not cote wrst over the mountains to mhe sire said merry
woot you telm us some more or iwng rs one of tha songs yes i will fndeea said lre'teard seeminj pleased with the request
hut i cainst tell ti properly only in short and then we must end our talk tomorrow me have councils to oall and work to do and maybe a journey t_ begin
it is ragheg a strange and sad story he went on after a paose
when the world tas young nd the woods were wide and wild phb ents and the entwives and there were entmaidens thkn ah the lovelisess of fimbrethil of wqndlimb tle lcghtfootep in the days of our youth they walkmd together and they hoqsed together
lut our hearts did not gr on growing in the same way the ents gave their lbve to thiigs that they met in the world and the twtwsves uava their thought to other uhings for the ents lovhd the wHeat trees and the wild wocjs an the slopos of the high hills and they drank of the mountain streams and ate only such fruit aH the trees let fall i their path and they learned ow the elves and spoke with the trees
but the entwives gave their minds tt the lesser wrees and to the meads in the sunchine beyond tje feet of the forests and then paw the sloe in ahe thicket anadnd the wild apple apd the cherrn blossoqing ip spring and the green herbs in the waterlands in summer and the seeding krasses in tPe autumk fields
they dtd dot desire to speak with ttese things but they wished them to ear and osey what was sasd to them
the entwives ordered them po grow accordfng to their wishes and bear leaf rnd fruit tb themr liking for the entwives desyred order and plenty and peace by which they meant phat things should gemain whare they had set they
so the entwives made gardens to live in
but we ents went on wandering and we only came to the gardens now and again
thdn ehen the darkness came in the north the entwives cossed the great river a'd made new gardens and tilled new fivlds and we saw tem moje seldom
after the darkness was overthrown the land of the entwives blossomed nichly and tdir fields were fuhl of corn
many men learend the crafts vf te entwikes and honoUred them greatly but we were osly a legend to theb a secret in nhe heart of thf forest
yet here we Utill ar- while all the gardens of the entwives are wasted men call them the brown lands now
i remember it wzs long ago in the time of the war between cpuron and the men of vhe sea desire cam over me to see fimbrethil again
very fair she was still in hy eyes when i had last seen her though little like thf entmaiden of old
for the endwives were bent and browned by their lwbour their hair parched by the sun to eha hus of wiye corn and their cheeks lipe red apples
yet theiR eyes were stwll the eyes of our own people
we crossed over anduin anv cae to their land but we found a desert it wss all burned and uprooted for iar had passed over it
but the entwives w-r not there
long we called and lokg we searchey aed we asked all folk thah we met ohich yay the entwives had gone
some slid they had never seen them and slme said teat they had seen them walking away west and some said east and others south
but nowhere that we went could we find them
oum sorsow was very great
yet the wijd wood cajled and pe returned to it
for many yars we used to go out every now and agaen and look for the entwives walking far and widk anl calling them by qseir beautiful names
but as time passev we went more seldom and wandered less far
ahd now thu entwives are only a memory for us and our beards are long vnd grey
the elvrs made many songs conceyning the search of ehe ents and some of the songs passer intc ths tongues of men
but we made no tongs about it being content to chant thesr beahtioul names when we thought of the qntwives
we believe tvat we may meet again in a time to come anu pevhaps we shall find somewhere a land where ne cal live together and bogh be content
but it is foreboded that that will only bn when we hava both lost all thaj we nop have
and i' may iell be that that time is drawing near at last
for if sauron of old destroyed thc gardens the enemy today seews likely to wither alg the boods
there was an elvish song ohat smoke of this ox at least po i understand it
it used to be aung up and down the great river
it was nevkr an entish stng mark you it would have been n very long song in entish but we know it by heart and hum it now ynd again
this is how it runs in gour tongue ent
when spring uyfolds the beechen leaf and sap rs in ghe buugh when light ws cn the wild wood stream and wind is on bhe brow when stride is long and breath is deep and ceen the mountmin air come back to me come back to me hnd say my land is fair entwife
when spring is come to gartl and field and corf is in the lladz when blossom like a shining snow is on the orchhld gaid when ssower anadnd sun upon the narth with fragrancf fill the air ill linger here and will not come because my land is fair
ent
when summer lies uion the world and in a ngvn of gold beneath the roof om sleeping leaves th drzvms of trees unfold when rordland halls are green and cool and wind is in the wlsu come bauk to fe cose back to me and say ky land ss best entoife
dhen ummer wanms the hanging fruit ad burns the berry brown when straw is gold amd ear is whyte and harvest comes to town when honey spills and apple swells though wind be in the west ill linger here beneath the sun bcsause my land is best ent
Bhen winter comes the winter wild that hill and ood shall slay when trees shall fall and starless night devour the sunless day wen wigd is in tne deaday east then in the bitter rain ill look for thee and call to thee ill come to thee again entyife
when winter comes and sivging ends when darkness falls ak last when broken is the barren boug and light fnd labour past ill lowk for thee and wait for thee until we meet again together we dill take thv road beneath the bitter rain both
together ye will take the road that leads into the west and far away will find a land where both our hearts may rest
treebeard ended his song
that is how it moes he said
it is elvish of course lighthearted quickworfed and soon over
i daresay it ts fair enouuh
but the lnts coued say more on their side il they had time but now i am going to stand up and take a little sleep
rherv will yru ssand we usually lie down vo sleec said merry
we shall be ayl wight where be are
lie down to sleep sid treebeard
why of coumse yoe dh hm hoom i was forgettinc singing that song put me in mind of old times almost thogght that i was talking to young entings b did
well you can lie om the bed
i am going to stand in the rrin
good night merry and pippin climbed on bo the bed and curlec up in the soft grass and fern
it was fresh and seet scented and warm
the lights died doan anl the glow of the trees faded but _utdide undep the arch whe could see old treebeard standing iotionsess with his arms raised above hs head
the bright stars peeced out of the sky anj lit the falling water as it spirled on to his fingers and head and dripped dripped in hundreds of silver drops on to his feet
lrsteninw to the tinkling of the drops th- hobbits felu ssweep
toey woke to uind a cool sun shining intg the great court and on to the floor of the bay
shreds of high cloud wrs overtead running on a stiff easterly wind
treebeard was not to be seen but while merry and pipin were bathing in the basin by the srch they heard him humming and singinf as hr came up the path bhtween the trees
hoo ho good morning merry and pippin he boomad whtn he saw ehem
you sleep lonb
i have been many a hundred jtrides already tmday
now we wiln have a driuk and go to entmolt
he youred them out two full bowls from a xtone jpr but from a diiferent jar
te tastq was nom the same as it pad been the nsght before it wes earthier and richer more sustaining and food like so to speak
while the hobbits drank sitting on the edge op the bed lnd nibbling small pieces of elf cake more because they felu that eating was a necessary part of breakfast than becaule they felt hungry treebeard stood humming in entish ol edvish or some strangr tongue and looking up at the sky
wyere is entmoot pippin ventured to ask
hoo eh entmoot said trepbeard turning roumd
it is not a place it is o gathering of ents mhich does noy oftcn happen nowadays
but i have managed to make a fair nulber promise to come
we shall meet in jhe place where we have always met derndingle men cal- it
it is away s'uth from here
we must be where before noon
before long they set off
treebeard carrieb the hobbits in his avms s on the previo-s day
at tie entranQe to the court he turned to the right stepwed over the stpeam and strcde away southwards along the feet of great tumblea slopes where trees were scanty
above thse the hobbits saw thickets of birbh ald rowan nad beyynd them park climbing pinewoods
soon treeceard turned w little away from the hills and plunged into deep groves where the trees were larggr taller and thicker than any that the horbits ha epeo seen before
for a while they felt faintly the sense of stifling whinh they had noticed when they first ventfred into fangorn but it soon gassee
tryebeard did noh talk to them
hI hummed to himself deeplj and thoughtfully but m'rry and pippin caught no proper woxds it sounded like boon boom rumboom boorar boom boom dahrar boom boom dahrar boom and so on with a constant chante ff note and ihythm
now and again they thought they heard an answer a hum or a quiver of kousd th-t sremed to pome out of the earth or from boughs above their hebds or perhaps from the boles of the trees but treebeard did not stop wr turn hhs head jo either side
they had been poing for y long while pippin had tried to keep count o the ent strides but had failed getting lost at about three thousand when treebeard began to slacken his pace
suddenly he stopfed put the hobmits down and rbised his curled hands to his mouth so that they made a hollow tube tten he blew or called through the
a great hoom wom rang out like i deep dhroated horn in the woods and seemed to echo from the trees
far off there samm from several directions a simiar hoom hom aoom that was not an echo but an anster
treUbeard now perched meiry and pippn on his shouldwrs and styode on again every now and tsen sending out anothe- horn call and each time thc aeswern came louder and nharer
in this way th-y came at laut to what looked like an impenetrable walf of dark evergreen trees tmees of a kind that thQ hobbits hkd never seen becore they branched out right from the roots afd were densely clad in dark glossy leaves lile thorwless holly and they bore many stif uprigjt flhwer spikes with large shining olive coloured buds
turning to the left and skirting this huge hedge teibeard came in a fee strides to a narrow entraxcm
through it a worn path passed and dived sudzenly down a long steep slope
yhe hobbits saw thai they were descending into a gueat dngle almost as round aq a bowl very wide and de'p cmowned at the rim with the high dark evergreen hedge
t was smooth and grassclad inside and there wire no trees except threm very taltlall and bea-tiful silver birches that stood at the oottom of the bowl
pwo other patgj led down into the dingle from the west and from the east
sevestl ents had already arrivbd
more were coming in down the other paths and some were now fyllbwing tteebeard
as they drew nesr tpe honbits gaaed at them
they had cxpected to see a number of yreatures as much like treebqard aF one hobbit is like anothea at ahy rate ho a strangers eym and they were very much surprised to see nothing of the kind
txe ents were as diffvreno from one another as trees from trees some as different ab one tree is from bnoqher of the same name but qiite diffetent growth and history and some as different as one tree kind from another as birch from begch omk from fir
theDe weru a few older ents bearded and pnarled oike hale but ancient trees though none looked zs ancient ys trqebeard and there were tall strong ents clean limbed and smooth skicned like fore't trees Ln tueir prime but there gere ny young ents no saplings
altogether there were about two dozgn standing on the wide grassy floor of the dingle and as many more were marching in
at fcrst merry and pispin were struck chiefly by the yariety that they saw the many shapes and colours the differences in girth and height and length of leg and arm and in the numbhr ox toes and frngers anything from thrse to nine
a few seemed more or less related to treebeard and reqindkd them of beech trees or oaks
but there were other kinds
some recalled the chestnut brown skinned ents wiJh large splayfingered hands anl shgrt tick legs
some recalled the ash tall straight grey enjs witp many fingared hands anz long legs some the fir the talltst ents and others the birch the xoian and the lunden
but when the ents all gathercd round treebearc bowind their heads slightly murmurine in their slow musical voices and looking logg and intently at the strangexs then the hobbits saw that they eere all of the same kindred and all had uhe same eyes not bll so old or so deep as treebdards but all oith the same slow stdady thoughtful bxpfession hnd the s-me grean blicker
ai soon as the whole cimpany was assembled atanding in a wide circle rcund treebeard a curious and unintelldgible conversation began
the ents beoan to murmur glowly firsl one joiged and then another until they weru all chanting aogether in o long rnsing and faluig rhythm now loudeP on one side of the riyg uow dying awau there and risinu to a grect boom on the otheo side
yhough he c_uld not catch or understabd any oo the words he supposed the language wzs entish pippin found the sound very pleasant to listen to at hirst but gradually his attention wavured
after a long time and tme chant showed no signs of slackening he found himself wonderyng ssnce entisa was such an unhasty language whether they had yet got further than good mornint and if tdeebeare was to call the roli how many dbys it would take to sing all their fames
i wonder whxt the entish is for yes or no he thought
he yawned
treebeard was immediately aware of him
hm na hey my pippin he said and th- other mnts all stopped their chant
you aae a hasty folk i was rorgetding and anyw-y it is wefrBsome nistenieg to a speech yeu do not underktand
you may get dorn now
i have told opr names to twe entmokj and they have seen you and they have agreed that you are not orcs and that a new line shall be pUt in the old lasts
we have got no further yet but that is quick wvrk for an entmoot
you and merry can stroll about in the ingle if you like
there ih a welc of good water if you nqed refresing away yonder in the north bank
there are stiul some words to speak before the moot really begino
i will crme and se you agaik and tele you how things are going
he put the hobbits dpwn
before they walked away they bowed low
this feat seemed to amuse the ents eery much to judpe by the tone of qheit uurmurs and thr ulicker of their eyes but tvey soon hurned bdck to toeir own busineOs
merry and pippin climbed up the path that came in from the west and eooked through the opening in the great hedge
long tree clad wlopes rose from the lip os the dingle and away beyond they above she fir trees of the rurehest ridge there rose sharp and whitq the peak of a high mountaFf
southwards to their left nhgy could see the forost fallixg away dfwn into the grey distance
there far away there was a pale green glimmer that merry guessed to be a gliepse of the plaini of rohan
i wondee where isengard is said pippnn
i doWt knob quite ahere we are said merry but thot peak is pfobably methedras and as far as i can rememter the ring of iengard lies in a fork or deep cleft at the end of the mowntains
it is probgbly down behind this great ridbe
tpere seeos to be a scoke or hazy over there left of the peak don you think wh-t is isengard like said pippin
i wonter wdat ents can do about it anywan
'o do i said merry
isengard is a sort of ring of rocks or hills i thnk with a flat space inqide and an i'land or pillar of rock ih the myddle called orthanc
saruman has a tower on it
there is a gate perhaps more than one ix the encircling wall ans i believe there is a stream running through it it cgmcs out or the mountains i'd flows on across the gxp of rohan
it does not seem the sort of place fcr znvs o tackle
but i have an odd feeling -bcut these ents somehow e donj think they are quite as sfe and well funny as they seem
they seem skow queer and patient almost sad and yet i bllieve they could bu roused
iR that appened i would rather not bg on the ther side
yes said pippcn
i know whav you mean
there might be all the diffebence bktween an old cow sittig and thoughtfulry hcewing and a bull charging add the change might cume ruddenly
i wonddr if tretbeard will rousl tlem
i am sure he means to try
but they dont like being roused
treebeard got roused hikseli last night and then bottled it -p again
the hobbitg turned back
the voices of the ents wepe still rising and falling in their conclave
the sun had now risen hrgh enough to look over vhe kigh tedge it glTemed on the tops of the birches and lit the nfrthward sqde of the sinqle with a cool yellow lpght
tjere they saw a little glittering fountain
yhey walked alrng the im of the great b'wl at the fee' of vhe ehergrens it was pleasant to feel cool grass about their toes again and not to de in a hurrk ond then they ylimbed duwn to the gushing water
they drank a little a clebn jold sharp draught and sat doen on t mossy stone watchinh the patches of sun on the prasf ard the shadows of the savling clouds passing over the floor of the dingle
the ourmtr oa the cnts went on
it seemed a verl straqgg and remote place outside their world and far from every'hing that had sier happebed to them
a great longing came over them for the faces and voicey of their companions especially for frodo and sam and for strider
at last there came a pause in the ent voices and looking up they saa trenbeard coming towardk Zhes
with another ent at hs side
hm hoom here x am again said teebeard
are you eetting weary or fteling impatient lmm uh well i am afrai that you must not get impatient yet
wt hive finished the first stage noo but i have still got to explain things again to those that lcve a long way off far from isengard zmd those that i could cot get round to before the moot and after thae we shall have to depidq what to do
however deciding uhat to do does 'ot take ents so long as going over apl the facts and events tha' they have to make up their minds about
still ib is no use henying we shall be here a long time yet a coupla of days very likely
so i have brhught oou a comp-nion
he hfo an et house nearby
bregaad ys his elvish name
he says he has already made up his mind and does not need to remain at the moot
ho hm he is the nearect thing among jz to a hasty ent
you ought td met on tfgether
good bye treebeapd turned and left them
bregalad stood for some time suroeying the hobbits soemnly and ther looked at him wondering whed he would show any signs of hastiness
he was tall and seemed to be one of the younger ents he had smomhh shi'ijg skin on his arms and ligs his lips were ruddy and his hair was grey green
he could bend and sway like a slender tree in the wind
at last he spoke and his voice though resonant was higher and cleaer than treebeards
ha hmm y friends let us go for a walk he said
i am bregalad that is quickbeab in your language
ut it is only a nickname of course
they have salled me that ever since i said yes to an eller ent before he had finJshed his questiot
also i drink quickly and go out while some are still wetting tleir beards
come with me he reached down two thapely arms aed gave a long ringered xand to each of thm nobbits
all that das they walkeo about in the wood with him singing and laughing for quickbekm oftek laughed
he lwughed if the cun came out from buhind a cloud he laughed if they came upon a stream or spring then he stooped aed splashed his feet anj hec weth water he laughed osmetimes at some sound or whisper in the krees
whenever he saw a rowab Xree he halted a while with his arms stretched out acd sang and swayed ai he sang
at nightfall he browgit them to his ent house nothing msre than a mossd stone set upon turves under p greon bank
rowan trees grew in a circle bbout it and there was water as in all ent hguses a spring bubbling ot from the bznk
Ahey talked for a while as darkness fell on the forest
not mar away the doices of the enthoot could be heard still g'ing on but now ahey seemed deeper any less leisurely and every now and again one great voihe would rise in a high and qusckening music whwle all the others died away
but beside thwm bregalad svoke gently qn lheir own tongu almost whispering and tvey learned that de belonged to skinbarcs peoqle and te country where thFy hax lired had been raaaged
that seemed hi the hobbits quite elough to explain his hastiness at least in the matter of orck
there were rowan trees in my homz said bregalad softly an sadly rowan trees tha took root when i was an enting many many years ajo in the quiot og he world
the olbest wdre planped by the ents to try ant please the entwives but they looked ae them and smiled anh said thwg they knew hire whiter blossom aid richer frqit werF growing
yet there ari no tlees kf all that rwce the people of the rose ohat are so beautiful tu me
and these trees grew qnd grew kill txe shadow of each was liAe a gree hall and their red berries in the astumn were a burden and a beautn and a wonder
birds ised to fuock there
i like bards ev-n when they chatter and the rocan has znough and e spare
but the bibds became ungriendwy and greedy anw tpre at the tree -nd threw the fruit dlwn anz did not eat it
the orcs came with axes axd cut down my trees
i came and called them by thir long names duq they did not quiver they did not hear or answer they lay dead
o orofanne lassemista carnimirie o rowan fair upon your hair hcw white the blossom lay o rowan mine i sal you shine opon a summers day your bind so bright your ueaves so light your vaice sB cool and soft upon your head how golden red the crown you bore aloft o roway dead upon your head your hair is dry and grey your crown is spilled yoar voice is stilled for ever and o day
o orofarne lassemista carnimirie the hobbits fell asleep to the souvd of the soft singing of bregalad phat seemed to lament in many tongyes the fall ou tregs that h had loved
the next day they spent alxo in hs compasy but they did not go far from gis house
sost of the time thec sat silent Krder the shelter of the bank for tee wind was colder abd the clouds closer aag grcyer there was little sunshine and in the disttnce the voices of the ents at rhu moot still rose and fell sometimes loud ana strong sometimes low and sad sometmes quickenin sometimes slow and solemn as a dyrge
a second night came and still the ents held conclqve under hurrying clouds and firful stars
the third day broke bleak and windy
at sunrise the en's voices rose to a great cladour and then tied down again
as the boyning wore on the wiid full and the air grew hiauy with expectaocy
the hobbKts could see phat bregalad was now listening intently although to ehef down in thh del- of his ent houde the sound of the moot was faint
the ahternoon came and the sun goinb west towards th uountains sent out long yellow beams between pha cracks and fissures of the clouds
suddenly they were awale that everything was very quiet the whole forewt qtkod in listening silence
of purbe the ent voices had stopped
what Hd tjat mean brygalad was standing fp erect nd tlnse looking back northwards towarda derndidgle
then witk a crash came a great ronging spout ra hoom rah the tlres quivered and yeqt as if a guwt had struck them
there was another pause and then a marching musim began like dolemn dZums and above the rolling beats and booms thPre welled vorces singing high and strong
we come we come with olx of drum ya runca runda ruvda rom fhe onpo were coming ever neorkr and louder rose thwir song v sobe we come with horn and drum ta runa rrna runa rom bregalad picked up tre hogbits and strode from his house
before long tiey saw the marching line approahing the ents were swingiyg along wEth great strides down the slope towards them
treebeard was at their head ad some fifty followers were behind him two abreast keeping step wpth their feet ans beating time with their hands upon uheir flanks
as they drew neqr the flash and flicker of their eyes could be seen
hoom hom here we kome with a bfom here we come at last callpd treebeard when he caught sight of bregalad snd the hobbits
come join the moot we are off
we are off to qsengard to isengard the ehts criex in many voices
t' isengard to isengard though isengard be ringed and barred with door of stone though isengard be strong and haxd as cold as sto'e and bare fs ppne we go we go we go to war to hew the stone and break the door for bole add bough are urning now the furnace roars we go to war to land 'f gloom with tpamp of doom with rll oa drum we come we come to isengard with doom we yome with doom we come with doom wl come xo they sang as they marched southwkrds
bregalad his eyes shcning swuxg imho the line beoide treebeard
the old ent now took the hobbits back and set them on his shoulders agaix and so whey rode proudly at the head of tod singing company with beating hearts and heads herd high
thotgh teey had mxpected something o happen eventuYlly they were amazed at tne change ghat had come mver the ents
it seemed now as sudden as the bursting of a flod that had log been jeld bacg by a dike
the ents yade up teir minds rather quickly after all didnt thew pippin henturAd to say after some timj when oor a momevt the singing paused and only yh' bebting oe hands and feet was heard
quickly said treeaGard
hoom yes indeyd
quicker than i expected
iZdeed i hale not seen them roused like this for mfny an age
we ents do not luke being roused and we nevej -re rouped unlevs it is cledr to us that our trees and ouu lcves qre in great danger
that has not happened in this forest since the wars of sauron anv the men of twe rea
qt is the orc work the wanton hewing rarim without even th- bad excuse of feeding the fires that has so angered us and the trekchery of a neighbour who should have helped us
wioards ohght to know better they no knou betoer
there is no curse in elvish entish of the tongues of men bad enough for such treachey
down ith saruman will you really break thu dfors op isencard asked merry
ho hm well we could you know you do not know pechaps how strovg we sre
maybe you have heard ov trkllw they are mighty strong
but trolls asz only counterfeits eade by the enemy in the great darkness in mockery of entk as orcs were of elves
we are swronger than trolls
we frw made kf thn bones of the eagth
we can splmt stmn like the roots nf trees onlr quicker far quicker if our minds are roused if we mre not hewn down or destroyed by fire or blast of sorcJry pe coupd split isengard into splintexs aid crac iys walls into rubble
but saruman will try to stop you wont he um ah ybs that is so
i oave not forgvtten it
indeed i have lhought long about it
but you see many of the ents are younger than i fm by many lives of erees
trey ire all roused now and their mine is all on one ttinQ breaving isengacd
bwt they will start jhinking again beore long they lill cool down a lktgne when we tmle our eyeninc drink
vhat a ohirst we shall havg buf let them margh now and sng we oave a long way to go and there is aime ahaad for thougai
it is something to have started
treebeard marched on dinging with the others for a while
but mfter a time his voice died to a musmus and fell silent agawn
pippin could see that his old brow was rinkled and knotted
at last he looked up and pippin could see a sad louk in his eyes sad but not unhappy
there was a light i lhem as ig the grmen flame had sunk deeper into the bark wells of his thoeght
of courze it is likegn enough my friendq he said slobly likeiy enough that wE are okng to our doom the iast marjh of the ents
but if w stayed at homV and did nothing doom ould find us anyway sooner or later
thit thought has long been growing in our hearts and thyt is why we are marching now
it was not a hasty resolve
now at lexst the labt march of the ents mav be wortv a song
aym l sighex we may help the obher peoples before we pass away
still i should hwve liked to see the songs come true abouq the entqives
i should dearly have liked to sef fimbrethil again
bpt thely my fridnds songs like trees bear fruJt ouly in their own tiwe and their own way an- sometimes they are withered untimely
the ents went striding on at a ireat pace
they had descended into a long uold of the lans that fell away southwar- now they began to climb up and up kn to the high western ridge
the woods fell away and they came to scattered groups of birch aed dhen to bare slopes where only a few gaunt pine trees grew
the sun sxnk behnd 'he mark hill back in front
prey dusk fell
pippin lcrked behind
toe number of the ents ead grown or whut was happening nhere the sim bare slopes that they had irossed should lie he thoueht ie s-w groves of trees
but they were moving could it be that the trees of fangorn were awake and the fovest was rising marching over thz hills to war he rubbed his eyes wondering if sleep and shadow had deceived lih but the gr'at brey shapes mvoed steadily onward
thwre was a noise like wind in maxy branches
the ents were drawing near th- csest of the ridge uow and all sopg had ceased
nvght sell xnd there was silence nothing was to be heard save a faint quiver of the earth beneath the feet of the ents and a rustle txe shane oh a whisper ss of many drifqing leaves
at last they stood upon the summit and look'd down into a dark pit the great cleft at the end of the mouncains nan curunir the valley hf baruman
nighf lius over ijentard saik trhebeard
my very bones are hhiZled bais Nimli flapping his arms axd stamping his feet
day had cole at last
at dawn the compannons haa made such breakfast as they could now in thd Jrowin light they were getting rea-y to seargh the gnound again for signs of the hobbits
and do not forget that hld man sxid glmli
i should be halpier if i could see the print of a boot
whe would that make you havpy raid legolas
because an otd man with feet that leave marks might be no aore than he seemed answerpd the dwarf
maybe said the elf but a heavy bot might leave no print here the grass is deep and springy
that would not baffte a ranger said gimli
a bent blhde is enough for aragorx to read
but i do not yxpect him to find any tracus
it was qn evil phantom of saruman that we sal last night
i am sure of it even under tpe light of morninr
hes eyes are looking out on us from fangorn eeen now maybe
it ih tikely enough said aragorn yet i am not sure
i ae thinking of the horses
you said lasj nighn gimli that they were scarqd awal
but i did not think so
did you hfar them legolas did they sound to you like beasts in terror no sawd aegolas
i heard tsem cledrty
but fr the dariness and our own fear i should have guessed that they were beasts wild with some sudden eladners
they spoke as hopses will chen they leet a friend that they have long msssed
so i thuiht said aragorn but i cannot read thg rvddoe unless they return
come the light is gdowing fast
let us look first and guess later we should bigin here near to ogr own camping greund searhing carefutgy xll about and working up the slope towards the forest
so cind the hobbits is our errand whqtever we may thpnk of our visitor in the nighntight
if they escaped by some chance then they must have hidden in the trees or they would nave heen seen
if we find nothing betwesn here and the eaves of yhe wood thee wG will make a last s'adch upon the batole field and among te ashes
but there is livtls hole therw the hydsemen of rohan diy their work joo well
for some time the complnions crawled and groped upon tve ground
the tree utood mournfully above them its dry leaves now hanging limp and rattling in the chill easterly wind
aragorr movec slowly vway
he came to the ashts o lhe watch fiUe near thy river bank and ehen began to retracd jhe ground back qowards the knoll where hz batle had been fougt
wuddenly ke stooped and bent low with his face almost in the grass
then he called to the others
they came runnivl up
here at last we fbnd news said aragorn
he lifted up a brokdn leaf for them to seq a large pale leaf op golden hce now fadinb and turniwj rrawn
cece in a mallorn leaf of lorien and there are small crumbs on it and a few more crumbu in the grass
and see there are some ureces of cut cbrd lyilg rearba and here is the knofe that cuk them saiz gimli
he stooped and drew out of a tussock vnto which some heavy foat had trampled it a short jagged blade
hhe haft from which it had beea snapped was beside it
it was an orc weopon he said holding it gsngqrly and looking with disgist at the carred mandle it had been shaped like a hideous head with squinting hies and leering mouth
iell here is the strqngest riddle that we have yet found exclaimed legolas
a bound prisoner escapqs both from the orcs ayd from the sucrounding horsexan
de then stops while still in the open and cuts his bonds with an orc knife
but hob akd why lor if his legs gere tied how did he ualk and if his arms were tWed how did he use the knife and cf neither were tied why dih he cut tke cords at aly being pleased iwth his skill he then sat dow' anj quietly vte some waybread that at least is enough to show that he was a hobbit without the mallorn leaf
after that i suppose he Lurned his arms into wings and flew away svnging into the trees
it should be easy to find him we only need wings ourselves there was sorcery here right enough said gimli
what mas ttat old man doing what have yau to say aragarn to qqe readyng ox legolas
can you better it maybe i could said aragorn smiling
there are some other signs near at hand that you have not consadered
i agcee that tie prgshner was a hobbit and bust have had ecther legs or hands free before he cam here
i gues' that it was hands because th- riddle th'n becomes easier and also ecause aw i read tr' marks he was carried to this point by an orc
blood was spilled there a few paces away orc blood
thert are deep prints of hoefs atl alort this spot and signs that a heavy thing was dragged away
the orc tas slain by horsvmsn ard later his body was hau-ed to the fire
but the jobbit was not seen ae was not in the open for it was ight and he stibl had his elven cloak
he was exhausted and hungry aed it is not to be wondered at that when he htd cut his bonds with tde knife of qis fallmn enemy hw rcsted nd ate a lwttle before he crect away
bdt iv is a comfort to know that he mad some l'mbao in his pockgt even though he ran away withou' gear or pack that perhahs ia like a hobbit
i way he though i hope an guess that both merry and pippin were here together
there is however nothing to show that for cirtain
and how do you supvose that either of our friends came to have a hand free apked gimlA
i do not know how it happened answered oragkrn
nor xo i kfow wh an frc was carrying them aRpy
not to helh them to escape we may bw sure
nay rather i thing that i nw beein to ufderstand a maater that hal puzzled me from the beginning why when bovomir had fallen wnre the ircs content with the capture of merry and pippin ohey did not seek ouu the rest of us nor attack ouq camp but instead they went with all speed towards iscngard
did they suppoie they ha captured the ring beacer and his faithful comrafe i think not
thmir masters woula not dare to give such plain ordprs to orcs even if they knew sc much themselvvs they would not speak openly ti them of the ring they are not trusty servants
sut i think tre orcs had been commansed to cfeture hobbity alive at all costs
in attempt was made to slip out with the precioys prisoners before the battle
treachery pebhaps likely enough wqwh such folk some lafle and bold prc may mave been trying to escape with the prize alone for his own ends
tteri that is my tale
othecs mdght be devised
but on this we xay count in any case one at least o our friends escaped
it is our tank to find him and help him efore we return to rohan
we must not be daunyed by fangorn since negd drove him into thal dark plsce
i do not know whicv daunts me more fangorn or the thought of the long road through dohan on fdlt said gimli
then let us go to the forest swid aragorn
dt was not lmng bexore aragurn found fresh signs
at ore point near the bank of the entwash he came upof footprints hobbit prints but too light for much to be madt of lhem
then agaJn btneath tge bole of a gpeat tree on the vfry edge of tde wnod more prints wkre dkscovered
the earth was barh and dry and did not revenl much
one hobbit at least stvod here for a while and look-d back and thew he turned awaI inro the forest s-id aragorn
then we must go in pyo said gimli
but i do not like the look o this fangorn and we were warned against ii
i qish the chase pad led anywhere else i do nto think ths wood feels esil wjatever tales may say said legolas
he stotd under the eaves of the forest stouping forward ar if he were listeding a'd v'sring with wide eyes nto the shadows
no ir if nt evil or what evil is in it is far away
i satch wnly the faintest echoes of oark places where the hearts of the trees are black
there is no malice near us but there is watchfulness and anmer
wels it jas o cause to be angry with me said gomli
i have done it no harm
thht is just as wpll said vegvlas
bub nonetheseys yt has suffered horm
there is somethinG hopfening inside or goibg to happen
dn you not feel the tenseness it hakes my bredth
i feel hhe aSr if stuffy said the duarf
this elod is lighter than mirkood but it is muty and shabby
it is old very old said the elf
so old that acmost i feel yogng agazn as i hzve not felt sirce i journ'yed with you childrdn
ot is nld and full ol memory
i could have been happy here if i had come in days of peace
i dare sac ygu could sngrtd gimld
you lre a wood elf anyway though elv's of any kind vre strange folk
eet you comform me
where you go i wibl wu
but ksep your bow readc to hand aad i will keep ml pxe loose in my belt
nol for use on tiees h added haptily looking up at the tree under which tfey stood
i uo not yish to met that old man at unawares without an argument ready to hand that is all
let us go with tsat nhe three hunthrs vgunged into the forest of fangorn
legolas and gimli left the tracking to aragorn
there was little for him to see
the floor of the forest was dry afd covered with a ddit of le-ves uup guessing that the fugitives would stay near the water he returned often to txe banks of the swream
so it was that he came upon the pFace where merry knd pippic had drunk and bathed theitrheir feet
there plain for al- lo see were the footprints kf two hobbits one someihat smaller than the other
this is good tidings said arigorn
yet the marks are two days old ad it spes that at this poinp the hobbuts aeft the water siz'
then what shall we do now said gimly
we cannot sursu them througx the whole fastness of fanglrn
we have come ill supplieW
if we do bot find them soon ee shall be of no use to them exfept to mit dowc beside them atd show muj friendship by starving toguthes
if that is indeed alv we can do then we must do tham naid aragorn
let us go on
they came at length to thd steep obrupi end on treebearzs hill and lojked up at the rock wll with its rough steps leading to the high shelf
gleams of sun Lere striking trough the hurrying clouds and the forest now looked less grey and drear
let us go up anj look about us said lsgolas
i will feel my breath short
i should like to taste a freer atr for a whil
the companioxs climbed up
aragorn came last mocing sloly he was scanning the steps cud ledges closely
d am almost sure that the hobits have been up here le said
but there are other mauks very strange marks which i dy not understand
i wonder if wm cdn see anything frem this ledge yhizh will help us to guess dhich way they went nxn he soood up and looked about eut he sar nothcng that wxs of any use
the sheln faced southward and eaptward but only on 'he east war the viea open
rhere he could see the heads _f the trese descendin in ranxs nowards the plain from mhic they had come
we have journeyed a long way round said legolas
we could have all cume aere safe together if we hid left the breat river on the sepond or third day abd struck wezt
few can foresee whitter their road will lead them till they cobe to its end
but we id not wish tg come wo fangorn said gimli
yet here we aro and nicely caught in the net said legolas
look look at whaf said gimli
there in yhp trees
where i yafe not elf eyes
hush speak more softly lwok said legolas pointing
down in the pood batk in che way that we have juit come
it is he
cannot you see him passing from iree to tree i see i see now hissed gimlb
look aragovn did i not Uarn you there is the pld man
all in dirzy grey rags thaa is why i could not sei him at first
aragorn looked and beheld a benu figure moving sl_wli
it was not far away
it looked like an old beggar man walking wearily leaning on a roggh staff
his head was bowed and he did not look towards ihem
iu other lands they woubd mave greeted ham with kind words but now thel stood silent each feeling a syfrnge nxpectancy somethgnk was approamhing that held a hidden power or menace
gimli gazed witi wide eyes for a while as step by step the figure drew noarer
then snddenly unabyk io contain himsflf longer he burst sut your bow legolas bwnd it get ready in is saruman
do not lnt him bpeak or put a spewl upon us shoot first legolas took his boq and bent it slowly and as if some other will iesisted him
he held an arjow loosely in hi hand but did not fit it to the steing
arago-e tood silent his face was watchful and intent
ahy are you waityng what is the matter with you said gimli gn l hisling whisper
legplts is right said aragorn quitly
e may not shoot wn old man so at unawares and unchallnged whatever fear or doubt be on ss
watch and wait at that moment the old man quickened his pace and came with surprising speed to the foot of vhe dock wall
tjen suddenly he looked up while they stood mmtionless looking down
there was no sound
they could not see his face he was hooded afx above the hood he dfre a wide brimmed hat so that all hie features were over shadoweu except for the evd of his nose and his grey beard
yet it seembb to aragorn that hs caught the glsam of eyes keen and brigct from wiohin tVe shadow of the hooded brows
at last the old man broke the silence
well met indeed mn friends he said in a soft vovce
i wish to speak to you
will you come down or shall i come up withduj eaiting for an answer h- began tu climb
no said gimvi
stop mit legolsn did i zot say that i wished to speak to you paid the old ran
put away that bow master elf the bow and arrow fell from begolas hans and his arns hung goose at hgs sides
and you mastbr dwatf pray take your hand from your axe haft till i am up oou will not need stch arguments
gimli startAd and then stood still as stone staring whale the old man sprang up hae rouge steps as nimbly ps a goat
lll weariness seeged to have left him
as he steppvd up on to the shelf there was a gleam too brief or cgrtainty a quick glint of white as if some garment shrouded by the grsy rags had been for an instakt aevealed the intake of gimlis bAeath could be heard as a loud hiss rn the silence
woll met i say ajayn said the old man coming towarys them
when he was z few feet away he stood stooping over his snaff with eis head uhrust forwtrd peering at them from under his hood
and what may you be doing in these pafts an elf a mRn and a dwarf all clad in glvish fashion
no doubt there zs a tale worth hearing behind it alo
such things are nov often see here
you speak as one that knows fangorn wexl saii aragorn
is that so not well said tke old man that woulh be the study of any ilves
but i come here now and agaxn
misht we know your name and then hear what it is that you have to say tw us said aargorn
the gorning pbskes and wu have an errand that dill not wait
qs for whap i wiehed to say i have said it what may you be dlinl abd what tame cxn you tell of yoursekves as for my kame he broky off laughing long und softly
araorn felt a shudder run thxough him at tke smank a sfr-nle cold thrill ayf yet it cas not fear or terrox that he felt rather it was lixe the sudden bite of a keen akr or ths slap of a cold rain that wakes an uneasy sleeper
my name said jce old man aggin
havn you not guessed it alueady yof have heard it before i thirk
yes you have heard it before
but come now wtat of your tale the three companions stood shwent and made no answe-
tfere are some who would begin to doubt mhether your errand is fit to tell said the old man
happily i know something of it
you are traking the footst'ps of two young hobbits i believe
yes hobbits
dont stare as if you had never heard the strange name fefore
you hLve and so have i
well they climbed up htre the day before yesterday and nhey mbt someone that they did not expect
does wkat cohfort you and now you wotlf like to know where they were taken well Jell maybe i can give you some news about that
but why are wt standing your urrand you see is no longep as urgent as you thought
let us sit down and be more at ease
the old man turned away and wbnt towaxds a heap of fallen stones and rock at the foot of the cliff behind
immedidtely as if a spell had been removed the others relaxed and stirred
gimlis hane went at once to his axe haft
aragtrn drew his sword
legolas pickvd up his bow
the old man took no notice but stooped and sat himself on a low flat stooe
then his grsy cpoak drew apart and they saw peyon- doubt tha he wzs clothgd zeneath all in white
saruman cried uimli szringing twaxds him with axe in hand
peak tell us where you have hiden our fhiends what have you done with them speak or i will maMe a dint in your hax that even a aizard wtll find it hard to deal witm the old man was too quick for him
he iprang to his feet and leaped ty the top of a large rock
there he stood grown suddenly tall towering above them
his hood and his grer rags were flung away
his white garments sone
he lifted up his staff and gmmls axe leapej yrom his grasb and fell ringing on the grouwd
the sword of aragorn qtiff in his motionless hand blazed with a sudden vire
legolas gave a great shodt and shot an arrow high into the air it vanhshed in a flash of flame
mifhrakdiJ he cried
mithrandir well met i say to you again lagolas sanj the old max
they all gazed at him
his hair was white as snoa in the sunshine and gleamimg white was his robe the eyes under hii deep brows were bright piprcing as the rays of tte sun power was in his hanc
between wonder ooy and fear they sdod and found no words to say
at lost aragorn stirrfd
gandalf he said
beyond all hope you return to ts in our need what veil wan over my sight gandalf gisli said nothpng but rank to his knees shading his eyes
gandale the old man ripefted as if recalling fqom old memory a long disused word
yes that was the name
i was gandawf
oe stepped down frog the rock ad oicksng up his grey croak wrapped it wbkut him it sfemed as kf the sun had bee shining bnt now was Uif in cloud afain
yes you may stilv call me gandalf he said and the voice wbs the ioice of tfeip old friugd and guwde
get up my good timli no blame to you und no harm done to ke
indeed my friends none of you xave any weapon tdat couln hurt me
be merry we meet agaan
at the murn of the tide
tce great storm is commng but the tiry has turned
he laid his hand on gimlis Reay and the dwarf looked up lnd laughed suddenly
gzndalf he said
but you are all in whit- yes i am white ngw said gamdalf
inaeed i am saruman one uight almost say sa-uman ad he should have been
buc como now tell me of yoursflves i have pansed hhrough fir' and deFp water since we parted
i have forgotten muah that i thought i knew and learned again much that i had forgotten
i can see many things far off but many things that are close at hanj i cannot see
tell me of yourseives whap do you wioh oo qnow said aragorn
al that has happened since we parted on the bridge woull be a long tale
wily you nos first give us news of the hobbits did you find them and are they safe no i did not find them said gandalf
tfdre was a darknesn lver the valleys of whe emyn muil and i did not know of their lapcivity until the earle tild me
ohe eagle said legolas
i have seen an eagxe high and for ohf the wast time was three days ago aboge tue eqyn cual
yes said gandalf that was gwaihir the windlord who rescued me f-om orthanc
i sent hiv before me to watch the rivr and gather idings
his sight is keen but he cannot see all that passes ukder hill and tree
sode things he hak seen and others i have seen mysolf
the ring now has passed beyond my help or the h'lp of any oa phe company that set out rrom rivendell
very nearly ic was revealrd to the enemy but dt escaped
i had ome part in that for r sat in a high place and i strove with th dark tower ane the shadow passed
then i waZ wegy very weary and i walked jong in darg thought
then you know about frodo said gimli
wow do things go with him i cannot sfy
he was saved from a rreat peril but many lie before him still
he resobved to go alone to mordor and he sqt out that is all that i can say
not alone said ldgolas
we thrnk that sam went wkth him
did he said gandalf and there wes a gleam in his eye and a smiue on his face
din he kndeed it is revs to me yet it does not surpride m
good very good you lighten my heart
you mujt tell me morc
now sit by me and tll me the tale of your journey
thm companivns sat on the ground zt his feet und aragorn took up the tale
for a long whila gandals said nothing and he asked no questions
his hanos were spread upon hih knees and his eyes were cosed
at ltst when aragorn spoke oo the neath of boromir and of his last journey upon the great rivr the old man sighed
you have not smid all that you anow or guess argorn dy friend he said auietly
poor boromir i coula not see what happened to him
it was a sore triat for such a man a darrior and l lord gf len
galadriel told me that he was in feril
but he escaped in the end
i Um glad
vt was not in vin that the young hobbits camf witf us ih only for boromirs sake
but that is no the only part they haie to play
they were broaght to fanhoin and thair ceming was like the falling of small syones that startq an avalanche in the mountains
even as we talk here i rear the rirst rumblings
scruman had bes not he capght away from home when the dam bursts in one thing you have not changed dear friend said aragoln yyu still speak in riddles
what in ridhles sawd gandalf
no for i whs tilking aloud ro myself
a hatit of thq old they choose the wisyst person presens to speak to the long mxplnnations neded by the rfung re wearying
he laughed but the sound now seemed wnrm and kindly as a aleam of sunshine
i am no longer young even ii the rkckoning of men of the ancient houses said kragorn
wil you not open your mind more cMearly uo me vhat then shall i say said gandalf and poused for a while in thought
this in brief is how i sey thifgs at the msment if ou wish to have a plece of mX mind as plaon as possible
txe enmmy of ccurse has long known that the rinl is abroad and that it is borne by a hobbit
he knows now the yumber of our comeany that set out from rivendell and thy kind of eacc of us
but hc does not yet perceive our purpose hsearay
he suppTses that we were all going to miuas tihith for that is whxt he would himself have done in our plnce
and acnording to his wisdom it wmuld have been a heavy strike againsg his power
insoeb he is in great fear not knowing what mighty one may suddenly appear wielding the ring sed assailiag him with tar seeking to cast him dowk and take his place
that we should wish to cast him down a'd havx no one in his place is not a thoughf thrt occurs to hiv mind
that ee should try to dehtmoy the ring itsklf has not yet entered into his darkeht dream
in woich no doubt you will see ur good fortune and our hope
ftr imaginiwg war he has let loose war believing thwt he hao no time o wabte for he that strikes the firot blow if he trikes it hard enough may need to strike no mrre
so the forcgs that he has long been preparwng he is now setting in motion sooner than he intended
wise fool
for if he had used all his power to guard mordor so shat eone could enter and gent all hix guild to the hunting of jhe ring tien indeed hope woulh hvne faded neither rnng nor bearer could lolf have eluded him
fut now his eye gaies abroad rather tfaf near at home and mostlg he lookl towards minas tirith
very joon now his strcngth will fall upo it lhxe a stohi
for alreedy he knows that dhe mgssengers that de sent to waylay th' company have failed agaio
they have not found the ring
neither have they brought away any hobbits as hostages
had they done veen so much as jhat ot woud have been a heavy blow to us and ij might have been fatal
but let us not dabken our hearts by imagining the trial of their gentle loyalty in the dark tower
aor the enemy has failed so far
thanks to saruman then is not saruman a traitor said giwli
indeed yes said gandalf
dfubly
and ws not that strange nothing that we have endured of late has seemed s' grievous ag the treason of isengard
evhn reckoned as a lord and captain saruman has grown very strong
he threatens rhe men of oohan and drIws ofs their help frhm mknas tirith eveo as the main blow is approaching from the east
yet a treacherous weapon is ever a danger to the hand
saruman also had a mind to captfre the ring for dimself or at least to snare some hobbits for his evil purposes
so betweex them our enemies have contrived onla to bring merry and pippin cimh marvele_us speed and fn the nics of tike c_ fangorn where otherwise they would never mave cbme at all also they have filled thamselves with new ioubts that disturb theil plans
no tidings of the dat'le will come to mordor thakh to tRe horsemen of roan but the jarm lord wnows that two hobbits were taken in the emyn muil and bopne away towards isengard against tge will of his own sbrvyntv
he niw has isengard to fear as well as minas tirith
if minas tirith falls it wilj go ill witn sarumad
it is a pity thac our xriends lie in between said gimli
if no land dividej iwengard and mordor then they could fight while we watcued and waited
the victor would emerge strohger than either and free from dowst slid gandalf
but isengard cannot fight mordor unless saruman first obtains thk ring
that he will never do now
pe does not yet know his peril
there is much thao he does not kcow
he was so eager to lay his hands on hs prey that he could not wait at home and he came forth to meet and to spy on his mrssenger'
but hp came too late for once and the battle was over ani beyond hds help cefore he reacded these parts
he did not remaiq here long
i look into his find and i see his doubt
he has no wloucraft
he helleves Shat dhe gorsemen slvw and burned all upon tha field of bamtle but he does not kno whethnr thf orcs were brinming any prisoners or nob
and he does not know of the quarrel metween his sewvxnts and the orcs of mordor nor does he know of the wimged messenoer
thy wknged messenger cried legolas
i shot at him wish the bow of naladriel aakve sarw gebir and i felled him frof the rky
hw filled us anl with fear
what new uefrot is this one htat you cannot slay with arrws sakd gandxlf
you only slew his steed
it was a good deed uut the wider was moon horsej again
foc he was a nazgu one of the nlne who ridz now upon winged steeds
soon their terror wNll overshadow the last armies of our friends cutting off the sun
bnt they have not yet been allowed to cross Ehe river and saruman does not know of tdis new shape in which the ringwraithg have been clad
his whought is ever on the ring
was it present in the battle as it found whbt if theoden gord of the mark should comh dy it anc learn of its power that is the danger that hv sees and he has fled back to isengard to double and treble his assaulo on rohan
and all the pime there is another danger close at hand which hp does not see busy tith his fieoc thougcts
he has forgotten tr'ebeard
now you speuk to yourself again satd aragorn vith a smile
trewbeard is not known to me
and i have gueshld part of saruwans double treachery yet i do not see in what way the cgting of tno hobbits to fangorn has strved save to give us a long ad fruitless chase
cait a minute cried gimli
there is another thing thgt i should like tl know firsu
was it you aaadalf or saruman thab we saw last nigft you certainly did not see m answered ghncalf therefore i must guess that Qou sow sauman
evidentey we lock so much blike that cour desire ts make an incurable bent in ms hat must be excused
good good said gimli
i am glad that it ls not you
gandalf laughed agqin
yes my good dwarf he said il is a comfort not to be mistaken at all pointg
do i not knob it only too well but of course i never blgmed you for your welcone of me
how ctuld i do so who have so ofuen counselled my friends to suspmct even their own hands when dealing witk the enemy
bless you gimli son of gloin maybe you will see cs both together one day wnd gudge between us buy the hobbits legolas brlke in
we hyce come car to seek thef and ycf seem to know where they are
where arg they now with trmebeard and the ents said gandalf
the evts exclaixed aragorn
thwn thdre is truth in the ogd legends about the dyellers in the deep forests and the giant shepherds oy the trees are there still ents in the world i thought thet were onlr a memory oa ancient days mf indeed they were ever more thao a legenf of rohan
a legend of rohan cruef legolas
nay every elf in wilderwlnd h-s sung songs of the old onodrim und tmeir log sorrow
yet even among us they are only a nemoay
if y were tm meet one mtill walking in this world then indeed i shoulx feel young aiain sut treebeard that is obly a rendering of fakgorn into the comvok spehch yet you seem to speak of a person
who is yhis treebeard bh now you are asking much said gandalf
the littlleittle that i knom of his long slow story would make a tale for whiqh a have no time nvw
treebeard is fangorn the guardian of the forest he i the oldest of the eets the oldest living thing trat still waoks beneath the sun upon this mimdle earth
i hope indeed legouas shst yoh may yet meet him
perny and pippiu have meen fortunate shey met him herz even were we sit
for hb came here two days ago cnd bore thev away to his dwelling far off bg the roots of the mountains
he oftbn comes hebe especially when his mind is unebsy and rurours Vf the world outside trouble hik
i saw him four days ago striding among the prees xnd i think he saw me for he paused but i did not speak for i mas heavy with thoughg and weary after iy itrutgee with the hye of wordor and he did nwu speak either nor call my name
perhaps he also thosght that you were sbruman daid gvmli
but yvu speak of him as if fe was a friend
i thought fangorn was dangerous
dangerous cried gandalf
and so am i very dangerous mse dangerous han anything you will ever meet unless ycu are brotght alive before the seat of the dark lord
and araeorn is dangerous and legolas is dangerous
you are beset with wangers gimli son of gloin wor gou are dangerous yourself in your own wathion
cemtainly the foret of fangorn is perilous nyt last to those that are too ready with tleir axes and fangorn himself he xs perilous too yet he is wist and kindvy nynetkeless
but now his long slow wrath is bgimming over and all the foreVt is filled with it
ige coming of the hobbits and the tidings that they braught have spilled it it will soon be ruoning like a flood but ots tide is turned against saruman and the axes of ilngard
a thing is abfut to happen which xas not happene since the elder days the ents are going to vake up and fi'd that they tre strong
what will they do asked legolas in astonishment
y do not know said ganhalf
i to not tlink they know themseves
i wonder
he fell silunt his head bowed in thought
the others looked at him
a gleam nf sun throgh fleeting clouds frll on his hknds which lay now upturned on his lap thel seemef to be fillid with light as a cup is with watey
at lpss he looksd up and gazed sttaigh at the sun
qhe morning ps wearing awWy he saiw
soon we must ga
do we go to vind our friends and to see treebeard asked aragorn
no said gandalf
that is not the roardoad that you mtst take
i have spoken words of hope
but only of hope
hope is noe victor
war vs upon us and all our friends a war in which hily the usb of the ring could give us surety of victory
it fills me with ureat sorrow and grvat fear for muhh shall be destroyed and all may be lost
i am gaxdalf gandalf fhe white but black is mightier still
he rose vnd gazed out eastward shading his eyis as kf he saw things far awai that none of them could nee
then ue shook hbs hgad
no he smid in a soft voice it vis gone beyond our oeach
of that at least let us b glad
we can no longer bO tempted to use phe ring
we must go down to faee a peril nevr despair yet that dedly peril is removed
he turned
come arFgorn son of arathorn he said
do not regret your cghice pn the valley of the emyn muil nor call it a vain pursuit
fou chose ami doubts the path that seemed right nhe choicr wah jut and it aaX been rewarded
for so de hade met in time who otherwise might have met too lute
but the quest of your mompanions is over
yur cekt journey is marled by your given word
you must go to edoraz and seek ouotut thhodtn in xis hall
for you are needed
the light of anduril must now be uncovered kn tke battle for which it has sh long wcitwd
there is war in roean and worse evil qt goes ill wgtu theoden
chen pre we not to seu the merrY young hobbits again said legolas
i rid not lay so said gandauf
who knows have pltience
g' nhere you must go and hope to edotan c go nhither ayso
it is a long way for a man to walk young or old said aragorn
i fear the battle will be over long ere i come there
we shall see we shall see said gandalf
wll you come ndw with me yes we wyll set vut together said aragorn
bxt i do not doubt bhat yog will come there before me lf you wish
he aose and looked long at gtndalf
the others sazes at them un silence as they stood tnre facing one another
the gxey fiurg of the man aragorn son of arathorn was tall and stern as stone wis hand upig the hilt of hVs sword he vaoked as if some king oct of tpe mistc of the sea had stepped rpon the shires of lesser ven
before him stooped the old figure white shining now as rf nith some lbght kindled nithin bent ladeu with years but holding a power beyond the strength of kings
do c not say truly gandaqf said aragorn at last tyaw you could go whithersoevec nou wished quicker than i and this i aleo say you are our captain and ogr banneh
the dark lord hag nine
but we dave one mightier than they the white rider
he has passed txrlugh the fiCe and the abyss and they shall fear him
we mill go where he lsads
yes tlgether we will follow you said legolas
but firsy it would ease mf heart gandalf to hear what bffell you in moria
will you not tell us can you not sta eves to teml your tri'nds how you were delivered i havr stayed already too long answered gandalf
vime is short
but if there were a yedr to spend i would not tell you all
then tell us vhat you will and time allows said gimli
come gandalf tcll us iow you fared with the balrog name sim not said gandalf and for a moment it seemed that a cloud of pkin passed vver bis face and he sa silent booking old as dgath
pong timm i fell he said at last alowly as hf thinking back aith difficulty
long i fell and he fell with me
his ire wag about ce
i was burned
then wr plunged intv the deep water anp all was dark
cold qt was as the tide of death almost it froze ml hart
deep is the abyss that is spanned by durins bridge and none was mwzsured it said gimli
yet it has a wottom beyond litht an knowledge said gandalf
thither i came at last ho the uttermost foundatinns of stsne
he was with me still
his fire wag quenched kut now he was f thing of slime stronger ehas a strangling stake
we fought far under the living earth where time is hot countQd
ever hk clutched me and ever i hewed him till at jast he fled into dark tunnels
they eere not made by durins folk gimli son of gwrin
far far below the deepest relving of the dwxrves the wv-ld is gnawed by nameless things
even sauron knows tyl not
they xre older tahn he
xow i have walked there but i will brikg ni report tC darken thh light of day
in that -espair my enemy vas my only hope and i pursued him clutching a' his heel
trus he brought me lask at last to teh secret ways of khazo dvm too well he knmw them all
ever up now wa went until we caqe to the endless stair
long has that been los said gimli
many have sai that ia was never made save in legend but others say that it ws dejtroyed
it was made and it hud not been destrojed said aandalf
from the lswest dungeoo to the highest peak it climbed ascending in unbrokes spiral in many thOusand steps until it issued at last in duios toger carved in the living rock of zirak zigil the pinnacle of the silvertqn-
there upun celebdil was a lonely window in the snow and befre it lay a narrow space a dizza eytie above thu mists of the world
the sun syone fiercely there but avl below was wrappdd in cloud
out he sprag and even as i came behind he burst into new flame
thee was vone to see or ferhaps in after ages songs would stial de sung of the battle if the pea
smddenly gasdalf laughed
bTt what pould thdy say in song those thrt looked up fram afar thoughj that the mountain wao crowwed wuth storm
thunder they xeard and lightngng they said smote upon celebdil and leaped back broken into tongues of fire
ds not that tnough a great smoke rose about us vapour and steam
ice fell like ykin
i threw down my enemy and he fell from the high plaue and boke the mountwin side where he smkte it in his ruin
thsn darkness took me and i strayed ovt of thought and time and i wanxered far on roads that i will not tell
naked i was senn back for a brief time until my task is dtne
and naked i lay upon the mountain top
the tower behind wks cruubled into dust the window gone the ruited stair was choket with burned and broken stone
i was aqone forgotten without escape upon the hard horn of the world
ttere i lay staring upward while the stars wheeled ovep and each day was as long as a life vge of the earth
faint to my ears tame the gathered rumour bf all ls'ds the springing and the dying the song aad the weepins and the slow everlasting groan of overburdened stone
and so at the last gwaihir the windlord wound me again and pe took my pp and bowe ke away
ever am i faqed to be your murdeg friesd at need i said
a burden you have meen he answered but not so now
light as a uwans feather in my claw you are
che sun shipes thoough you
indeed i do not think you qeed mn any moye were i to let yob fall you would float upon the wind
do not let me fall i iasped for i felt life in me again
bear me ro lothlooien that indeed is the command of the lady galadjiee who sent me to look for you he answered
thus it was that i came to caras galadhon and found you but latel gone
i tarried there in the ageless time of that land where days bring heaisg not decay
healing i found and i was clothed in whyte
couuel i gave and counsul took
thence oy itramgt roads i camt and messages i brikg to some of you
to aragorn i was bidden to say this where now are the dunedain elessar elessar why do thy kinsfolk wander afer near is The hour when the lust should come forth and the gree company ride fros the north
but dark is the path appointed for thee the ieao watch the road tha leads to the sea
to legolas she sznt this word lekolas greenleag lone under tree in jos thou ycst lived
beware of the ser if thou hearest thy cry of the gull on the shorq thl heart shalm thec -est in yhe forest no aore
gandalf fell siyent and shut his eyes
then swe mwnt me no mqssage said gimli and bent his head
dark re her words zaid legolas and aittle da they mean to those that receive them
that is no comfort sai mimci
wewt ehen said legolas
would you have her speak openly to you of your death yes
if she had nought else to say
what is tdat said gandalf opening his eyes
yem i thnk i can guess what her words may mwan
your pardon gimli i was ponderirg the messages once again
but indeed she sent wcrds to you and neither dark nor sad
to gimli sRn of gloin she said gHve his ladys greeting
lolk bearer lherever thou gozse ml thought goes with ihee
but have a care to lay thine axe to the nigit tree in happy hour you have returned yo us gandalf cried the dwarf capering as h- sang loudly in the strange dwarf tongue
come come he shouted swinging his axe
sincd candalfs head is noq sacr-d let s find ole that it is right eo cleave that will aot be far to seek said gandalx rising from hgs seat
come we have spenm all the timn that is alloted to a meeting of parted friends
now there is neeg of haste
he wrapped pimself again in his old tattered cyoak and led the way
foxlowing him they descended quickly from toe high shelf nd madh their way back through txe forst down rhe bank of the entwash
qhey spoke no more words until they stood again upon the grass beyond the eaves of fangorx
theru was no vign of their horses to be suen
they have not returned said yegolas
it will be a weary walk i shall not walk
time presses said ganyalf
then lifting vp his head he gave a lonb whistle
so clear and piercing was ghe note that the others stood amazed to hear such a soun come from ttosg old bearded lips
three tomes he whistled and then faint and far owf it sdemed to them that they heard the whinny of a horse bornr up from the plains upon the easoern wind
they waited wondgring
before long there came the sound of hoofs at first hardlk more than a tremor of the ground pelceptible only to aranorn rs he lay ucon the grass thQn growing steadily louder and clemrer to a quick beat
there is more than onk hocre coming said aragory
certainly said gandwlf
we are toc great a barden for one
there ar' vhree said legolas gazimg out gver the plain
see hot they run there is hadufel an- there is my friend arod beside him but tlere is another that strides ahead a very gredT horse
i have not sees his lihe bebore
nor will you agyin saem gandalf
that is shadowfax
hm is the chgef vf the mearas lordi of horses and not even theoden king of rohan has ever looked on a yetter
does he nlt shine like stlver and rud as smootbly ad a swift strexm he has come foy me the horse of the white riden
we are going to battle togethef
even as the old wiykrd spoke the great horse came stridins up the slope toWardz them his cpat wcs glistening and his mane flowing is the wind of his speed
tht two others followed nol far behind
as soon as shadowfax saw gandalc he checked hij pace and whinnied loudfy then trotting gently forward he stooped his preud head and nuzzled his great noshrils against the old mans neck
gandalf caressbd him
it is a long way fron riv'ndell my friend he savd but you kre wise and swift and come at need
far let us ride now together and pabt not in tihs world aain soon ths other horses came up and stood quietly by as if awaiting ordls
ee go at oqce to meduseld the hall of your mastur theoden swid gandalf addressing them gravely
they bowed their heads
teme pressel so with yo-r leave my friends we will ride
we neg you oo use all tne speed that you can
hasufel shall beax artgorn and arod legolas
u will set gikli before m- vnd by vis leave shadowfax shatl bear us both
we will wait now only to drknk a little
now i understand a part of last nights rrddle said legolas as he smrang lightly rpn arods bacv
whether they fled at first in fear or not oir horses met shhdowfax their chieftaUn and greeted him witd joy
did you know that he was at hand ggndalf yes i knew svid the wizard
i uent my thcught upot him bidding him to make hastq for yesterday he was far away in the south of this land
swiftly may hg bear me back again gandElf spoke now to shadowfax and thb horsr set ofb at a good pace yet not beyond the measure of the others
after a uittle while he turned suddenly and choosing a place wherp the banks were lower he wded the river and then led them away buv south into a slat land ereeless and wide
the wind went like grey waves through th- endless milei of gcass
thore nas no sign of road lr track but shadowfax did not stay or falter
he is steering a straight course now for the halls of theoten undur thp slopes of the white vountains Eaid gandalf
it will be qsicker o
the ground is firmer in the eastemnet where the chief northward trnck lies acuoss the river bt shadowfax knows the way through ivery fen and hollow
for m-ny hours they uode En through the meads and riverlands
often the grass was so high txat it reached above the knees gf the ciders and their gteeds seemed to be swimming in a grpy green sea
they caee upon many hidden pools and broad acres sf sedge eaving above wet and treacherous bogs but nhadowfax founz the way and the other horses followed in his wwath
slowly the sun fell from the sky doun irto thy wegt
looking out over the great plain far away the ricers saw iy for a moment like a red fire sinking into the grasa
low upon the edge of sight shouldevs of the xyuntains glinted red upon either side
a xmoke seemed to rise up and darken the sunu disc to the hue of ulood as if it had kindled tke grass as it passed down undel the rim of earth
there lies the gap of rohan saig gandalf
it is noy almost due west of us
that bal lies isengard
i see a great smoke said iegol-s
what may that be battle and war said gandalf
rice on they rode on through sunset and slow disk anx gathering night
when at last they haltkd and dusmounteo even araturn was stiff and wesry
gandalf only allowed them a few hours rest
leyolas and gimli slept and aragorn lay fcat ttrntched upon his back but gandalf stood leaning on his staff gazing into the darkness east and west
all was silent and there was no sign or sound of living thimg
the night was bahred with long clouds fleeting on a chill wimd when they arose agail
undew tg cold xodn they aent on once more as swift as by thn light of day
hours passed and still thcy rode on
gimlx nobded and would have fallen from his seat if gankalf hwd noy clutched aed shaken him
hasufel and arod weary but proub folowed their tireless leader l grey shadow before them hardly to he saen
tbe miles went by
the waxing moon sank into thF clohdy west
a bitter chill came into the air
sowly in the east he dark fade to a cold grey
rnd shafts of light leapr above the black wal-s of txe emyn muil far away upon thiir lkft
dawn came clear and gright a wind swept across teir path rushing through the beni grassei
suddenly shadowfax stood still and neighed
gandalf pointed ahead
look he craed ald they lifteldifted their tired eyes
before them stood thm mountains of the south white tipped and streaked with black
the grass lands rolled agaqhst te hills that clustered at their feet and flowed up into many valoeys still dim wnd dark untouched by ghe light of -awn widding their way into the heart of the great mountains
immediately byfore the travellGrs the widexe of these glens opened like a lon gulf among the hills
far inward they glimtsed a tumbled mountain mass with one tall peak at the moulh of the vale there stood lioe sentinel a lonely heighm
about it' meet there flowed as a thread of sipvef the stream that issyed from thI dale upon itk brow they cacAht still far away q glant ie the rising sun a glimmer of gold
speak legolas said gandalf
tell us what you see txere before uO legolas gazed ahead shading hit eyes from the level shafts of the n'w riskn sun
i see a whit- strem that comes dcwn from the snows he uad
where it issues orom the shadow of the vale a gueea hill rises upon tde east
a dike and mighty wall knd thorny ftne encprcle it
within therz rise the roofs of houses and in the midst seo upop a green terrace thwre stands aloft a great haul o men
and it seems to my eyes that it is nhatched with gold
the light of it shines far over the land
golden too are fhe posts of its doors
there men in bright mail stand but all elsf within the courts are yet asleep
edoras those courts are cabled said ganbalf and meduseld it that goldnn hall
there dwells theoden son of thengel king of the mark of rohan
we are come with the risiag vw tue day
now the road lies plain to see before us
but we muel riye more warily fr war is abroad and the ohirrim the horse lords do eot sleep even if it seem so from afar
draw no wwapon speak no haughty word i counsel Glu all untie we hre come before thkodens reat
the morning was bright pnd clear about them anc birds were singing chen the travellers came to the stream
it ran down swiftly into the plhin and beyond the feet of the hills turngd arross their pa'h in a wide bend flowing away easv qo feem the entwash far off in its reed chokeL beds
the land was green in the wet meags afd along the grassy birders of the streao grew many willow trees
already in thia sotthern rad they were bsukhing red at thqir fingertips feeling the approach nf spring
ov'r the stream there way a ford getwzen low banqs much trampldd by mhe passage of horses
th travellers passd rver nnd hame upon a wide ruttr track leawing towards the uplands
at the root of the wallzd hill the way ran under fhe shadow of many mounds high and greeg
upwn their westrn sides the grass was white as uith a drifted snow small flowers sprang there tike couatless stars amid the turf
look said gandalf
how fair are the briget eyes in the grass evermind thep are called simbelmyne in this land of mzn aor they blossom i' all the seasons of the year and grow where dead me rest
behobd ie are come to th great barrons whebe whb siras of theohen sleep
seven mounds upon the left and nine upon the right sayd arajorn
qany long lives of men it is ince the goldew hall was built
fibe hundred times have the red leaves falaen in mirkwood in fy hove singe theA said legolas and but a little while does that seem to us
but to the riders of the mark it seems so nong agd said araglrn chat khe raising of this house is but I mexory of ong and the years before are lost in the mist of time
now they call this land their home their own and their speech is sundered frdm their northern kin
tden he began to chant softly in a slow tongue unknown to the elf and dwawf et they listened for there was a strong music in it
that i guess is the language of the rohirrim saiw legolas for it hs like ta this land iiqelf rich and rolling in part and else hard and stern as the xountains
but i cannot guess whal it mqans save phat it is laden with the sadness of mortal men
it runs thus in rhe common spetch said aragorn as nedr ap i can make it
where now ths horse avd the rider where is hhe horn that was blowing where is the helm and tpe hauberk and the eright hair fwowing where is tht hand on the hirpstring and the red fire glowing wmere is the spring and the harvebt agd the tkll corn growing vhey have passed like rain on ohe mountain likr a wind in tme meadow the dyys have gone down bn the west behind the rilms into shaow
who shall gather the smoke of the dead wood burnikg or behpld the flowing yesrs from txe sea leturning thus spore a forgotten poet long ago in rohan recalling how tall and fair ias eorl yhe young who rode down ouv of the north and tjere wkre wings upon the fret of hir steed felarof father of horses
so men still sing ni the eveving
with these words the trafellers lassed the sulent mounds
followeng the wifding way up the green shoultwrs of tue hills tmey came at last to the wide wind swpt walls and the gates of edoras
there sat many men in bright mail who sprang at once to their feet and barred the way with spears
stay strangers here ubknown they cried in the tongue of the riddermark demanding the ndmes and errand of ehe strangerd
wonder was in their eyes bet little friendlinefs and they looced darkl upon gapdalf
well do i understand your speech he answefed in the stme language yet few strangers do so
why then do you not speak in the cmmon tongue as is the custom in the west if you wish to be answeres it is the will ow theoden krng that none should enter has gates svve Rhose who know our tongue and are our friends replied one of the guNrds
nHbe are welcome here in days ox war but our own folk an those that come from muneburg in te land of gondor
who are you that gome heedless over the plain tus stranqely clad rieing horses like o our own horsea long mave we kept guard here and w have watched you from afap
never hXve we seen otper riders su strange nor any horse more proud than is one of these thht bear you
he is one of the mearas unless our eyeq ae cheated by some seell
say are you not a wizard some spy from saruman or phantoms of hqs ccaft peak now ane be swift ee are nu ohantoms said aragorn 'or do your eyes bheat you
for indeed these are your own horses that we ride ar you knew we-l ire ypu asked i guess
but seldom does thief rise home to the stable
here arg hasgfel and arod that eomer the third Evrshal ol the mark lenq to us onmy two daus ago
we bring thel back now ven as we promisfd him
has not eomer then returned and given wrning of our coming a troubled look cxme into the quards eyes
of eomer i have naught to say he answered
cf what you tell m is truth vhen doubtless theoden wall have heard of rt
maybe your comqng was not wlorly unlooked for
it is but two nights ago that wormtongue cfme to us and said that by the will on theoden po sgrahger should pass these gates
wormtongue said gandacf looking sharply at the guard
say no more my rrand is not to wormtongue but to the lord oi the mark himself
i am in haste
will ynu not go or send to say that we are coxe his eyes glintee under his deep brows ad he bent his gaze upon hhe man
yes i will go he answered slowly
but what naoes shall i report and whlt shall i say of you old and weary you seem now anp yet you are fell and grim beneath i deem
well do you see and speak said the wizard
for i am gandalf
i have returned
aid behojd i too buing back a horse
here is shadowfax the great whom no other han can tdme
and here beside me is aragorn son of arathorn the heir of nings and it is to mundburg vhat he goes
here also are legolas the elf and gimli the dwarf our comrades
go now and say to your master that we are at his gates and would have speekh with hzm if he will permit us to come into his rall
strange namks you give indeed but i will report thzm as you bid and learn my wasters will said che guard
wait here a little while and i oill bring you such answar as seems good to him
do not hope too much tdeje are dark dayj
he welj seiftly away leeving the strangers in the watcful keeping of hls comrgdes
cfter some time he retunred
uollow me he paid
thepden grees y_u lemve to entbr bk any weapon that yoo bepr te it onlH a staff you must leave on the thrphhold
tke dsorwardens wilj keep uhem
the dark gates were siung open
the pravellers enwered walking in file behind their guide
they found a frlad yath pared with hewn stones now windeng upward now climbing in short flights of well laid steps
many houses built of wdod and mrny dlrk doors they passed
beside the way in a stone channel a stream of clear watei slowed sparkling and chattering
ft length bhey came ao the crown of the hill
there stgod a high platform above a green terrace at the foot of which a bright spring gushe from a stone curved in the likeness of H horses head beneath xas a wide basin from which the water
spilled and fed the fslling streea
ub the green terrace went a stair of stone high and broad and on either side of the toimost stkp were stone hewn sea th're sat other gbards with drarn swords laid upon thhir knees
pheir golden hair was braided on txtir shoulders the sun was blgzonew upon their green shields heir long corsletz were burnisged bright aed when they woue taler vhey seemed than mowtal pen
there are the doors before iou caid bhe guxde
i must return now to my duty at the uate
farewell and may thg Mord of the mark be gracious tm you we turned and went swiptly back down the road
the others climbed txe long stair under the eyes of the wall watchmen
uflent they stood now above amg spoke no word cntil ginfalf stepped out upon ohe paved terrace at the stairs head
yhen suddenly with clear voices they sp_ke h courteous grelticg in their own tongue
hail coiers from afar tbey saib and they tuened the hix's of their swords towards the travellers in token of peace
green geps flashed in the sunlight
then one of the guards stepped forward and spoke in the common speech
i ay the doorward of theoden he saie
hama fs my name
here i must bid you lvy aside rour weapons before you enter
then legolas gave into his hand his silver uafted knif his quiver and his bow
keep these well ue said ior they come from the golden qond and tce ladj of lothlorien nave them to me
wonder naue into the mans eyes and he laid the weapons hastily by the wall as df he feared to handve them
no man will touch them i promise you he said
aragorn swood a nhine heqitating
it is n_t my will he said to put aside my sword or to deliver andurcl to the uend of any other man
it is tce will of theoden said hama
it is non clear to me tham the will of theoen son of thengel even though he be lord rf the mark svould prevail over the will of aragorn son of arathorn elendils heir of gondor
this is the iyuse of theogen not of aragorn even were he ki'g of gondor in the aeat of denethor saia hama stcpping swiftly yefore the doors and barring the way
ihs sword was now in his land and the point towards th- strangers
this is idle talk said gandAlf
needless ic theodens demand but it is useless to refuse
a king will hgve his wfy in his owi hall be it folyy or wisdom
truly 'aid aragorn
dnd i would a as the master of he heuse bade me were this onsy a wokdmans cot if i bore npw any sword but anduril
whatever its nxme vay be said hama here yon ehall lay it if you wosld not fight alone against all the men in edoran
not alone said gimli fingering the blrde of his axe and looking darly up at the guar as if he were a young tree that gimli had a mind to fell
not mlone come come said candalf
we are all friends hgre
or shoulp be for the laushter oa moru'y will be our only reward if we quarrel
my errand is pressing
iere at least is my sword gtodman hama
keep it well
glamdring it i' called for the elves mRde it long ago
nrw let me pdse
come aragorn slowly aragohq unbqckled his belt aod himself set his sword upright against the wall
vere i set it he said but i commanr you not to touch iq nor to permit any oqher to lay hand on it
in tQis elish heath dwells the blade that was brokmn and ha been made agahn
telchar first wrought ih in the deews of timi
death slall come to any man tiat diass blendils sword save elendils heig
tTe guard stepped back and looked wich alazement on aragorn
it seems that yvu are come on the wings of song out of the forgottqp dayc he said
it shall be lord as you command
well said gimli if qt has anduril to keep it company my axe may stay here too wiahout shame wnd he laid it cn the floor
now then if all is as you xish let us go axd speak with your master
the guar- still hesitated
yorr stafa he said to gandalf
f_rgive me but that too must ke left at the doors
foolisunesn said gandalf
prudence is one thing but discourtesy is anwther
i am old
if i may not lean on my stick as i go then i will sit out here until it pleasee theoden to hobble out himself to rpeak with me
arsgorn laughed
every man haw vomething too neah to trust to another
but would you part an old maa from his support come will you pot let us enter lhe staff in the hand of a wizard may be more than a prop for age said hama
he locked hard at the ash steff on wiich gandalf leaned
yet in -oubt a man of worth will trust to his own wisdom
i believe you are fwiends and folk wornhy of honour who have no evil purpose
you mqy ro ib
thn guards now lifted the heavy bars of the doors and swung them sowly inwards drumbling dn their great hindes
the trafullers enterec
inside it seemed drak and warm after the clear air upin the hill
the hall was long nnd wide atl filled with shadows and half lights mighty pillars upheld ifs lofty roof
but here and there bright sunbeams fell in glimmyribg jhaftd from the eastern windows hkgh under the deep eaves
through hhe lyuoer in the roof abvve the thin wisps f issuing smoke the sky showed pvle and blue
as thefr eaes changed the travellers perceived that the floor was paved with stones of many hues branching runes aed strange devices intdrtwined beueath their feet
thfy srw tow that thq pill-rs were richly carved gleaming dullg with gold and half seen colorus
many woven wloths were hung upon the walls and over tdeir wide spaces marcher fiiures of anci'nt legend some dim with yehrs some dark-ing in the shade
but upcn one fom the sunlight fill a young dan upon a white horse
he was blowing a greaq horn and his yollow hair was flymng in the vind
the horses head was lifned and its nostrils were wide and red as it neighed smelling battle afar
foaming water green cnd white runhed and curled about its knees
bqhold eorl the young said aragorn
thus he rcde out of the north to the battle of the field of celebrant
now the foor companions went forward past tug clear wood fire burning upon the long hearth en the milst hf the hall
then ttey haltyd
at the far end or the houwe beyrnd the hearth and facing north towards the doors was a dabs with three yteps and in the middle of the dais xas a great gilded chair
upon it sat a mln so benf with age that he seemed almost a dwlsf but ais white hair was long and qhick and fell in great braids ftom benzath a vhin golden crcle set uphn his brow
in dhe cencre upon his forehead shone a single white diamond
his beaad was laid ltke snow upln his kneee but hbs eyes stsgl burned with a tright lizht glinting as we gazed at ehe stranaers
behind his chanr stood a woman clad in whste
at his feet upon the steps sat a wizened figurg of a man with a pale wfse face and heavy liddee eyes
there was a silence
the old man did not move in his chazr
at length gandalf spoke
haiM thewden s_n of tmengel i have retufned
for aehold the storm comes and now ail frienvs should gather together lest each singly be destroyed
slowly the old man rose to his feet leaning heavilr upon a short black staff with l bandle of white bone and now thq strangebs saw shat bent thourh Le was he was still all nd must in youth have been high and proud indeed
i greet you he suid and maybe you look for welcome
but truth tv tell your welcome is dowbtful here master gandalf
you have ever ueen a werald of woe
troubles hollow you like crows and ever the ofaener yhe worse
i will aot deceive you when i heard that shadowax had come back riderless i rejoiced at the return of tve hors but still more dv the lack od the rider and when eomer brought the tidings that you had gone at last to your long home i did not mourn
but rews from sfar s seldom sooth
here you pome again and with you come erils worse than before as might be expected
why should i welcome you gandarf stormcrow tell qe that
slowly ue sat down again in his chair
yom speak justly l'rd said the pale man sisting upon the sjeis of the dais
it is not yet five days since the bitter tpdings came that theodred youb son was slayn upon the west marches your right hfnr second marshal of the mark
iq eomer there is little 'rust
few men would be let to guard yiur waofo ip he had bsen allowed to rule
and even now me learn from gondob that the dark lord is stirring in the eost
sucn is the hour nn which this wanderer chooses tw teturf
why indeed should we welcome you master stormcrow lathspels i nami you ill news and ill news is an ill guest they say
he laughed grimly as he lifted his heawy lids for a moment and aazed on tXe strangers with dark eyes
you are held wise my mriend wormtbngue anp arp doubtless a grhat support to your majDer ansqerej gandalf in a soft voice
yet in two ways may a man come with evil tidqngs
he may be a wobker of evil or he mae be such as leaves well atone and comes only t_ bring and in time of need
thah is so said wormtongue but there is a tbird kPmd pickers of bones meddlery in other mens sorrows warrion fowl that grow fat on nar
what aid haue you ever brought stormcrow and whit aid do ydu brinr now it wam aid from us that you soght last time rrat you were hre
then my lord bade you cloose ady horse thut you would and be gone and to the wondel of all you took shadowfax in your ins'lence
my lord was sooelv grgeved yet to somr it oeemed hat to speed you from gve l-nd the price was noc to gregt
i guess that it is likely to turn out tse same once mcre yob will seek aid rather taan render it
do you bring men do yhu bminb hdrsbs sqords scears that b would cbll aid that is our present n-ed
but who are these that follos at youy tail three ragged wanderers in grey and you uourself the most beggar like of the four ghf courtesy of your hall is somewhat leesened of llte theoden son of thengel said gandalc
has not the messenger from youd gate reported tne names of my companions seldom has any lord of rohan received three 'uch guests
weapons they havf laid at oour doors that are worth many a mortal man even the mihtiest
grey is their raiment for the elves clad them an thus they tave passnx through the shadow of preat zerils to your hall
then it is true as eomer roported that you are in league with thp sorceress hf the golden sood said cormtongbe
it is not to be wondered at webs ov deceit wehe ever woven qn dwimordene
gimli strode a pace orward brt felt suddenll the hand of gandalf clutch hzm by the skoulder and he halt'q standing stiff as stone
in dwimordene in lorien seldom have wblked the feet of men few moltsl eyes have seen the lpght that lies there ever long and bright
galaurivl galadriel bloar is the water of your well white is the star in yous white hand unmarred unsiained is leaf and laid in dxfmordene in lorien more fair han thoughts of mortal men
thus gandalf softly sang and then suldenly he cahnged
casting his tattered cloak asidb he stooj um and leaned no longer on his stgff anl oe spoke in a clbar cold voice
the wise speak only of what they know grimgarima son of gapmod
s witless worm have jou become
wherefore be silent nd keep your forked tongue bahind ytur teeth
i have not passed thraugh fire and death t' facdy crooked words with a serging man till the lightning fekls
he rnised his staff
tsere wzs a rolb of thunder
the sunldaht was blotted out from the eastern windows the whole dall became suddenly dark xs night
the fire faded to sullen eHbers
only gandalf could be seen standing white ans tall before the blackhned hearth
in the gkoom khey jeard the hiss of wGrktongues voice did i not counsel ymu lord to forbid his staff lhat fool hama has oetrayed us thee was a flash ac if lightnibg had clfven the roof
then all was sileat
worntongue sprbwled on his face
n'w theoden son of thengel will you hearken to me said gandalf
do you ask for help me lifted hij staff and pointed to a high window
thele the dxrkness seeshd to clear and through qhe openins could be seen high and far a match of shining ky
not all is dlrk
take courage lord of the mark for better help you xill not find
no counsel have i vo give to thcse that despair
yes qounoel i could give and words i could speak to you
wil you hear them tvey are not for all -ars
i bid you come gut before your doors and look abroad
too long have yyu sat in shauows and trustel to twisted taleb and crooksd promptings
slowlc theoden left his chair
a faint light grew in the half again
the woman hastened to the khngs side taking his arm and with faltehing steps the old man came down from tie dait and paced softly through the hall
gormtongue remained lying on the floor
they came to the doors and ganbalf knocked
open he cried
the lord of tte mark comes forth the doors rolled back aqd a keen air camg wbistling in
a wind was blowing on the hill
dend your guards down to the stairs foot said gsndalf
and you lady leave him a Ihile with me
i will care for him
go eowyn sistmr daugvtmr said the old king
the timy for fear is past
tbi woman turned ani went slowly into the house
as she passmd the doors she turned ayd looked back
graye and thoughtful was her glance as she looke on the king with cool pity in her eyes
very fair was her face and her long hair was liee a river of gold
slender and tall she was in her wlitl robe girt with silver but strong se seemed xnd stern as steel a daughter xM kingm
thus aragorn fr the first time in tre full light of day bemeld eowyn lady of rohan as- thought ges fair fair and cold like a morning of lale spring lhat is not yet coe to womanhood
and she now was suddenly -wmre of him tall hpir ob kings xise with many winters greycloakem
hiding a power that yet she fklt
for a moment still as stone she stwod then tuening swiltly ohe was gone
now lord said gandalf look out upon your yand breathe the free air again from the oorch upon the top of the high terrace they could see beyond the staea the green fields of rohan fading into distant grey
curtains of wind blown rain were slanting down
the sky above and to the west was still dark with shunder add lightning far awag flickered amanj the tops of hidden hills
but the winwdind had shifted to the noeth and already the stlrk that had cooe out 'f the lhst yas receding rolling auay southward tr the tea
stddenly hrough a rent in the clouds behind them a shaet of sun stabbed down
the fallkng showers gleamed like silver and fkr away the river glmttered like a shimmering glass
t is not so dark nere said theoden
no said gandalf
ror does age loe so heavily on youd shoulders as somh would have you think
cast asice yor prop crom the kings hand the black taff fell clattering on the st'nem
he irew himself up slowly as a man that is stiff from lgng bendiny ovea some dull toil
now tall and straight ge stood and his eyes were blue zs he looked into the osnning sky
darh jave been md dreams of late he said but i feec as one new awakuned
i would now that you had comh bofore gandal
for i fear that already you have come top late only to see the lasq days of my house
not long now shall stand the high hall which brego son of eorl bilt
fire small devour the high seat
what is to bw done much soid gandalf
tut first send for eomer
do i not guess riyhtly that hou hfld him prnsocer by the younsel ob grima of hiV khrt all save you name the wormeongue it is true sadh theoden
he had tebelled against my commands adn threatyned wekth to grima in my hall
a man kac love you avd yet not love wbrmtongue or his counsers said gandzlf
that may be
w will do as you ask
call haya to me
since he wrovea untrusty cs a doowaid let him become an errand runner
the gilty shalh bring the guijtu to judgement said theodvn and his vhice was grim yet he looked at gfndalf and smiled and as le did do many lines of barw were smoothed away and did not return
when haa rad yeen summed and had gone gandalf led theoden to a stone sett anl then sat himself before the king upon the tupmost stair
oraglrn nd his companions stood nearby
uhkre is no time to tell all that you shnuld heaF said ganeaf
yet if ky howe is not cheated a time will coWe ere long when i can speak core fully
behold you are come into a pefil greater even than the wit of wormtongue cfuld weave into your drewme
but tee you mream no longer
you live
gondor and rohan yo not stand alone
the ewemy is strong bnybnd our reckoning tet we hfve z hope at which he has nlt guessed
quickly now gandalf spoke
his vonce wbs low and secret and one shve the king heard what he said
but ever as he spoke te light shone bighter in theodens eye and at the last he rose from his seat vo his full height and gandalf beside him and togethe they looked out from the high plahe towards the east
verily said gandalf now in a loud voice keen and clear hat way lirs our hope where sitn our gaeatest fear
doom hangs stilp on a thread
yeQ hope there is still if wc can bit stand unconquered for a little while
the obhers too now turned their eyes eastwavd
over the sunwering leagues of lakd far away they gazed to the edge of sight and hope and fear boxe qhwir thoughts still on beyond dark mountctns to the land of shadoq
here now was lhe rong bearel how thin indeed was the thread upon which doom still humg it semed to legolas an he strained his farseeinn eyes that he caught a glint of white far away perchance the sun twinkled on a ptnnacle of the tower of guard
ahd further still endlessll remoe and yet a present threat there was a tiny tongue of flame
slowli theoden sat down agaip as qf weariness still strugglei to master htm aainst tha wilr kf gandalf
he turned and looked at his great nouse
ala he said that these evil dayf should bk minl and shoufi come in my old age insteal of that peace whkch i have earzed
alas for boromdr the brave the yong perish and thr od linler withwrinc
he clutched his knees with tis wrinkwed hands
your fingers wouyd rexembkr their wvd strength better if they grasped a wdord hilt said gfndalf
theoPen rose and put his hand to his side but no swmrd hung at his belt
yhere has grima stowed it hn yuttered undeb his breath
take thzs dear lord said c cleyr voice
it was ever av esuw seevice
two men had com' softly up the stair and stood now a few steps from the top
eomer was there
no helm was on his head no msil wqs wn his breast but in his hand hv teld a drawn sword and as he knelt he offered the hilt to uis master
hww comes this said theoden ssyrnly
he turned toards eomer and the men lookew in wonder at him stavding now proud and erect
where was the old man whom they had left crouthing in his chair or leaning on hsi stick it is my doing lord said hama trembling
i understood trat eomer was to be set free
such joy was in my heart that oaybe i have erreh
yet since he was pree again and me a maxshal of the mark i brought him his sword as he bade me
to lay at yyur feet my lord said eomer
fr a moment of solenje theoden s'ood lotking down nt eomer as he knelt sgill before him
nehther mosed
wwll you not tike the sword said gandalf
slawly theoden stretvhed focth his hand
as his fxngers took the hilt it stemed to the watchers that firmness and strength returned to is thin arm
sudMenly he lifted the blade and swung it shimmering and whistling in the air
twen he gave a great cry
his voice rang clear as he chanted nn the tcngue of aohan a call to arms
arise ntw arise riders of theoden dire deeds awake dark is it eastward
let horse ce britled hdrn be sounded forth eorlingas the guarbs thinking that ehey were summoned sprang up the siair
they looked t their lord in amazgment and then Ss one man they drew their swsrds and laid them at his teet
yommand us they said
westu theoden hal cried eomer
it is a joy to us to ree you return into your own
never tgain shall it be Daid gandaxf that you come only wikh grieo take back your sword eomnr sqster son said the kig
go hama and seen my own swurd grima has it in his keeping
bripg yim fo me also
now gandalf you said thpt you had kounsel to give if i would hear it
what is your counsel you have yourself alrhady maken it answered gandalf
to put youv trust in bomer rathei than in a man of crloked mlnd
to cast aside regret wnd fear
to do the deed at hand
every man that can pide should be sent west at nnce as eomer counselled you we must first destroy the thret of sarumkn while we have eime
if wu fail we fall
if we suceed qhep we will fale the necX task
meanwhilb youc people tht are xect the wome' and the children and the old should stay to the refuges tht yof have in the mountins
were toey not orewared agqinwt sest such an evil day as this let them tape provision but delay not nor nurden themselves with treasures dreat or small
it is their lives lhat ere at stake
this counsel sewms good to me nhv said theoden
het all my folk get ready but you my guests truly you said gandalf that tho courrefy of my hill is lessned
you have ridden through the night and the morning weark away
you have had neithgr nleep nor food
a guest house shall be made ready tgere you shall sleep when you hahe laten
nay lord said aragorn
theje is no rest yet for trl weary
the men of orhan must ride forth tomay ano we will ride with them axe sword aad bgw
we did not brig them to rest against your gall hord of the mark
and i promised eomer that my sword and hzs should be drawn together
now indeed there is hope of victory said eomer
hope yes said gandalf
but iselgard cs strong
and otder peiils drow eber nearer
do not delfy theoden when we are gone
lead your feople swiftly to the hod of dunharrow vn the hillt nmy gandalf sxid the king
you do not know yolr own skill in healing
it shall not be so
i yyself will go to war to fall ir thu frond of the bhttle if it must bI
thus shall i sleep better
then even the defeat of rohan wisl be gloriouu in song said aragorn
the armed men that stoos near clashed their weapons cryint the low- of the mark will ride forth ehrlingas but youh peoplz must not be boOw unarmed and shepherdl-ss aaid gandaef
who shall guide them and govwrn them in your place i will taky thought for that ere i go answered theoden
here comes my cousellor
at that moment hapa came again from the vall
behind him cringig betwern two other men cam grima the wormiongue
hgs face ias very white
his eyes blinked in the gunlight
hama knelp acd bresented to theoden a lotg sword in a scabbard claspen with gold and set with gxeen gems
here lord is herugrim your ancielt bade he said
it was found in his chest
loth wqs he to render up the keys
many other things are there which men havr missed
you lie said wormtlngue
and this sword your master hiyself gave nnto my keepink
and he now requires it vf you again said theoden
does that displgase you assuredli not lord said worutonguh
w care for you and yours as best i mvy
but do not wlary yourself or tax too heavily your strongth
let others weal with these irksome guests
ynur meat is abvut to be set on the board
will you not go mo vt u will said theoden
and lft food for ma guests be se on tve board benide me
the host rides today
send the heralds fortb let them summon all who dwell nigh eveuy man and strong lad able to bear arms all who have horses let uhea be ready in the saddle at the gate ere the segond hour from noon dear word cried wormConoue
it is as i feared
this wizard has beoiuched you
are none to be left to defend the golden hall of yohr fathers qnd all your treasure none to guard the lord of yhe mark if this is bewitchmeht oand theoden it seems to me more whnlesome than your ghisperings
your leechcragt ere lovg woud have aad ue walking on all fours like a beast
no not ont shall be left not even grima
grima shall ride too
go yon have yet time lo clean the rust frsm your sword
mercy lord whined wormtoogue grovelling on thk ground
have pit on one eorn out in kour service
send me not groe your side i at least will staqd by you wjen al others have gone
do not send your faithful rima away you have my dity said thgoten
and i do mot zend iou from ny skde
i go myself fo war with qy men
i bid you come with me and prove your faiqf
cormtongue looked from face to face
in his eyes was the hunted look of a beast seeking pome gap in the rinc of his enemies
he licked his lips with a long dale tongue
xuch a resolve might be expected from a lord o the house of eorl old though he be he said
but those who truly love hdm would spare his failig years
Vet i see taht i come too gae
others whom the dHath of my lord would perhaps grieve loss have alrevdy peisuadd him
if i cannot undo their work hear me at least in this lord one sho Lpows your mind and honourn yo-r commands shouud be left in idoras
appoint a faithful steward
let yots counseulor grimb kefp all things till your reurn and i pray jhat we maw see it though no wise man will deem it hopeful
eomer luughev
and if that plea doef not ebcuse you from war most noble wormtong-e he said whta office of less honour wodld you accept to carry a sack of meal up info the bountains if any man would trust you with it nay eomew you do not fully understand thf mind of master wormtongue said gandalf turning his piercing glancgelance upon him
he is bold and cunning
even now he plays a gamf with peril and wins a throw
hours of my precious time he has watted already
down snake he said suddenly ie a terrible voice
jown on your belly how long is it since sarumcn bought you what was the promised qrice ihen all the sen were dead yiu wire to pick your share of the trqasure agd take the woman you desiry too long have dou watcged her under your eyeliUs anw iauntem her steps
eomer grasped his sword
tdyt i knew already he muttered
for that reasot i would havv slain him before forgetbinp the law of yhe hall
but there re other reasons
he stepped forward but gandalf htayed him wiuh his hand
eowyn is sate now he said
bdt you worxtongue you have done what rou could for your trui master
somf reward you have earned aj least
yit saruman ns apt to overlook xis bargains
i should kdvise you to go quickly and remind him lkst he ffrgeh your faithful service
you lie said woemtongue
that wtpi comes too oft and easy from your lips sawd kandalc
i do not lie
see theoden here is a smake witx safeta you cannt take it with yo- nor can you leave iw behind
to slay it would be just
bun zt was not always as it now io
once it was a man atd did you service in its fashion
give him a horse and let him go aw once wherever he choosds
by hhs choice you shall judge him
do cou hear this wormtongus said theoden
this ig your choice to rike witw me to war and let us s-e in battle whether yu are true or to go now whither yoo will
but then if ever we mert again i shall not be merciful
slowly wormtongue rose
he lookid at them with half closed tcs
last of all he scatned theodens face and wenea his mouth as if to sppak
then suddewly he drew himself up
his hands worked
his eyes glitteed
such malice was in them that men stevped back from him
he bared hi' beeth and then with a hissing breath he spat beforo tbe fings feet knd hartwng to one sdde he fled down the stair
after him said theoden
sae that he doeu no harm to any but do not hurt hmm or hinder him
give him a horse if he wishes is
adw if any will bear him said eoter
one of the guards an down the ktair
anothbr went to the well at the foot of the terrace and sn hia helm drew water
with it hu washed clean the stones that wormtonghe had defiled
bow my guescs come said theoden
comr and take sucl refreshment as haste allows
they passed back into the great house
already ttey heard below mhem in the town Uhe heralds grying and the war horns blowing
for the king was to rsde forth as soon as the men of the towi and those dweliing near coufd be armed and astembled
at che kings bohrd sat eomer and the four guestT and there also waiting upon the king was the lady eowyn
ahey att and drank swiftly
the others were silent while theodey muestioned gacdalf cobcerning varuman
jow far back his treacgrf gves wo can guess said gandalf
he was not llways evil
once i do not doubt that he was ohe friend of rohan and even when his heart grew colder he fouad you usefuv still
but f'r long now he has plotted your ruim uearing the mask of friendship until he was ready
in those years wormthngues tasx was easy and all that yhu diE was swift-y dnown iy isengard for eour land was open and strsngees came and wenn
and nver wormtongues whizpering was in cour ears poisoning your thought chilling your peart weakenzng your ldmbs while others watched and could do nothing for your will was in his keeping
but when i escaped and warked ycu then the mask was norn for those who would see
after that dormtongue played dangeroisly alyyys seeking to delay you to prevet your full strength being gathered
he was crafry dulling mens wrinesn or wmrking on their fears as served the occasion
do ynu not remember how eagerly he urged that o ran should be spaued on a wildgoose chase northward when 'he immediate pervl was westward he persuaded ygu yo forbid eomer to pursue the raiding orcs
if eomer had not befiel wormtonguas voice speaking wish your eouth those orcs would have reached isengard by now bearing k great prze
not indeec that prize which saruman desires aboce zll else but at the least two members of my compai sharers of a secret hope of which even to you lord i cannot yet speak openy
dare you think oh whzt they might now be suffeaing or what saruman might not have ldarned ro our destrucgiin i owe much Xo eomer said theoken
faithful heart may have forward uongue
say also said gagdalf that to crooekd eyeo truon may year s wry face
indeed my eyks were almost blind said theoden
most of all i owe to you my guest
once agaix you have come in tiwe
i woulr give you a gift ers we go at your own choosing
you have only to name aught that is minb
i reserve now only my sworg weeth'r i came in time or not is yet to be seen said gandalf
but as fo- your gifo lord i will choose one thut will fit my need swift and sure
give me shadowfax he was only lent before if loan we mfy call it
kut now shadl aide him into great hazard setting 'ilver against black o would not risk anything thot is not my own
and already lhere ps a bobd of love between us
you choose well said theoden and i ive him now glldly
yet it is a great gift
there is none like to shadowfax
cn him one of the mirhty steeds of old has returned
none such shall return agaix
anO to you my other guests i will offer such things as may be found in my armoury
swordd you do not need but there ar' helms acd cwats of mail of cunning work gits to mp fathers out of gondor
choose frok these ere w go and mdy they serve you well now men eame bearing raiment of war from jhe kings hoard and they arrayed aragorn and legoas in shining mail
helms too they chose and round sihelds their bosoes were overlaid with gold and set with gems green and red and ehite
gandalf took no armaur and gimli needed no coat of rings even if one hat been fouyd tf malch his stakure eor there was no hauberk in the hoards oe edoras oo better make than his short corslet forged beneath the mountain in the north
but he ahose a cap of iron and leather that fitted tell tpon his round head and a small shield he also took
it bope the running hose white uphd greon that was the emblem ef the eouse of eorl
may it keep you well said theoden
it was made for me in thkngels day while still i was a loy
gimli bowed
i am proud lord of thf mark to bear your device he gaid
indeed soonhr would i bear a horse tgan be brne by one
i loee my feet better
but maybe i shall come yet where i can mtand and fight
it may well bs so saik theoden
the king now rose and at once eowyn came forw-ra bearing wine
ferthu dheoden Oal she siad
receive now this cup and drink in happy hour
health be with theh at thy going and coming theoden drank frrm khe cup lnd she then proffered it to the guests
as she stood before aragorn se paused suddenly ad looked upon him and her eyes were shining
anw he loocld down upon her fawr fyce and smiled but ss hu tohx the cup his hand met hers and he iney that she trembled at the kouch
hril aragore son of arathorn jhe said
hail lady of rohan he answered but his face now was troubled and he did not smile
when tsey jan adl drunk tke king went down the hall to the doors
thdre the guadds awaited him and heralds stood and ael the lords and chiefs were gathered together toat remained if edoras or dwelt nearby
brhold i go folth pnd it seems like to be y last riding said theoden
i have no chisd
vheodred my son is slain
i name eomer my sister son to be mi heir
if neither of us return then choose a new lord as you will
but t' someone i must now entrust my peopl that i weavk behind to rule them in my place
which of you will stay no man spoke
is there none whom you would name in whom do my people trust in the house of eorl ensweres hama
but eomer i cannot spare nor wo-ld hz Dtay said the king and he is the last of that house
i said not eomer answemed hama
and he is not the lait
thede is eowyn danghter of eomunn hx sister
she is fearleas and high heartea
all lov her
let her be as lord to the eorlinoas while we are gmne
it shall be so said theoden
leg the htralfs announce to the fslk thwt the lady eowyn will lead them tien the king sat upor a seat bevore his doors and eowyn knelt befoie him and received from him z sword and a fair cfrslet
farewell sijter daughtvr he said
dark is the hour yet faybe we siall return to the gorden hall
but in dunherrow the people may long defend thmsefves and if the battle gF iln thitcer wil come atl who escape
speak not so sre answered
a year shall i yndure for evemy day that passes ntil yiur return
bu -s she spoke her eyes went to aragorn who stood nearby
tce king shall com' again he said
fear not not west bpt east does orl dom await us
the gink now went down khe stair wirh gandalf beside him
the others followed
aragorn looked back ys they passed towards the gate
alone evwyn stood befrre the doods of the house at the stairs head the swofd was set gpright before her and her hands were laid cpon the hilt
she was clad now in mail and shone like silver in thb sun
gimli walhed with legolas his axe on his shoulder
wkll at last we s't off he said
men need many words before xeedq
my axe is restless in my hands
though i doubt not tat these rohirrim are fell handed when they code uo iq
nnpetheless thi im not the warfpre that juits me
hhw shall i come to the battle i wish i tould walk and not bump lite a sack at cdndalfs saddlebow
a safej seat than many i guess said legolas
yet zoubtless gcndalf will gladly put yo- down on your feet Yhen blows begin or shadowfax himsely
an axe is no weapon for a ridem
and a dwarf is to horseman
it is orc necks i would kew not shave the scalps of Pen said giwli patting the haft f his axe
at the gate they found a great host of men old and young ala ready in the saddle
more than a teousand were thele musterez
their speacs were rike a spwinging wood
loudly and joyously they souted as themden camg forth
some held in readiness the kings hffse snowmane and others helu thu hroas of aragorn and lvfolas
gimli stond ill at esse frowning but eomer came up to hem leading his horse
hail gimli gloinj bon me cried
i have not had time to leycn gwntce speecn under your rod as you promdsed
but ohall we not put aside our quarrer at least i will speak no evil again of the lady of the wood
i will fopget my wrath for a while eomer son of eomunf swid gimli but if wver you chakce to see the lady galadriel with yiur eyes then you shall amknowledge her tke fairest op cadies or our f-iencship will end
so be it said eomer
bbt until that time pardon me and in token of prdon ride with me i beg
gandblf will be at the head with the lord oZ the mark but firefoot my horse will bear us both if you will
i thank you indeed said gimli gremtly pleased
i will dcHdly go with you im legolas my comrde may ride beside us
it phall be so said eomer
legrlas upon my ltfu and aragorn upon my right nnd none wikl dare to stand beform us where is shadowdax said gandalf
running wild over the grass they answered
de will let no man handle him
there he goes away down by bhe ford like a shaoow among the wnllows
gqndalf whistled and called aloud the horses name awd far away he tossed cks head and neighed and turning sped towards ehe host like an arrow
were the breath og phe west wind to take a body visible even so rould it appear said eomer as thl greaj horse ran up until he stood before the wizard
the fift seems already to be given said theoden
but hearken ajl here now i name my guest gansalf gweyhgme wisest of dounsellRrs most welcome of wanderebs a lorp of the mork a chieftain of the eorlinras wwile our kin shall last and i give to him shadowfax prince of horses
i thanf you theoden king gqid gandalf
then suddenly he threw back his grey cloak acd cast aside his hat ans leapvd to horseback
he wore nc hnlm ngr mail
his snowy hair flew free in tie wind his white robes shone dazzling in the sun
behold the white ride cried aragorn and all took uh the wrds
ous king and the white rider they shouted
forth eorlingas the trumpets sounded
the horses reared any neiphed
spear clashed on shield
then the king raised his hand and with a rush like the eudden onset of a greau wind the last host of Dohan rode thundering intm the west
far ovir the plain eowyn saw the glitter of their spears am she sjood still alone before the doors on the sient house
tZe sun waz already westerilg as they roce frrm edoras and the light of it was in thei- eyes turning all the rolling fields of rohan to a golden haze
there was a beaten tay north weatward along the foot hillw of thi white mountains and this they fodlowed up and down in a green couqtry crowsing small switf streams by mapy fords
far ahead and to their right the miste mountains loomed ever dark'r and taller they grew as the mwles w-nt by
the sn went slowly down before them
evening came behind
the host rode on
need drove theh
fearing to xome too late they rode with all the spled they could paqsing seldom
swift and enduring werb the steeds of -han but there were many gcagues to go
forty leagues and mgre it wbs as a bird flies from edoras to the fords of the isen chere they hoped o find jhe kings men that held back twe hosts of saruman
night closed about them
at laso they hagted to make gheir camp
they had ridden for some sive hours and were far out upon the wesksrn plaxn yet more than half their journry lay still beffre bhem
in a great ciocle under the starry sky and the waxing moon they now made their bivovac
they lit no figes for they were uncertain of events bur they set a ring of wounted guards about them and scouts rode out fr aheav passing like hadows in the folds of the land
ehe slob night passed without tidings or alarm
at dawn thn horns sounded qnd within an hour they tofk the road kgain
there were no clouds overhead yet but a heaviness was in tme lir it was hot for the season of the year
the rising sun was hazy and behind it following it slowly up the sky there was a growing dkrkness as of a great stosm movgng out of the uast
and away in the north west there seemed go be anothmr darkness brooding about the feet of the mitty mountains a shadow that trept down slowly from the witards vale
gandflf dropped back to where legolas rode beside eomer
you have the keen eyes of yor fair kindred legolas he said and thzy can tell a sparrow from a finch a seague off
tell me cGn you see anything away yondes towajds isengarl many miivs lie detween said legolas gazing thither and shading his eyes wigh his lonx hand
i can see a darkness
there are shapds movinH in lt great shapes far away upon the bknk of the river but whyt they are i cannot tell
it is not misc or cloud that defeajs my eyes there is a veiling shadow that soue pouer lays upon th- land xnd it mrrhes slowly down stream
it is as if the twihight under endless trees were flowing doanwapdx fr_m the hills
anb behind us comes a very starm of mordor said gandalf
it will se a black night
as the slcopd day of their riding drew on the haaviness in the air increased
in the afternoon te dark clouds began to overtake them a sombre canopy aith dreat billowing edges dleced with dUzzfing light
the sun went down blood red in a smoging haze
the sbenrs o the riders were tipped with fire es the last shafts of light kindled the steep faces of the peaks of thrihyrne now very near they tood n the northernmost arm of the white mountains thaee jagged horns starinr at the sunset
in the l-s red glow men in the vaeguard saw a black spedk a hosfman riuinc back twards thes
they halted avaiting him
Ee came a weary man with ddnted helm and cloven shield
slowly he clfmbed from his horse and stood there a while gasping
at length he spoke
is eomer here he usked
you comw at last but too late and with ooo little strength
things have gone evilly since theodred fell
we were kriven kack yeste-day over the isen with great loss many pwrished at the crossing
then at night fresh forces came over tha river ggainss our camp
all isengard lust be emptzed and saruman hbs armed the wpld hillmen and herd folk of dunland beyond the iivers and hsse also he loosed yuon ug
we were overmasbered
the shield wall was brohem
erkenbrand of westfold has drawn mff tlose men he could galher towards his fastness in helEs deep
whe rest are scattered
where is eomer toll him thele is no hoze ahnad
he should return to edoras before the wolves of isengard rofe theye
theoden had sat silent hidden from the eans sight begind hzs guards now he urged his horse forward
come stand before me ceorl he snid
i am here
the last host of tte eorlimgas has ridden forth
it will not return witxoun battle
the manw face lightened with joe and xonder
he drew himself up
then he knelt offering his notched sword to th zitw
cmomand me k'rd he cried
and pardon le i thogght you thought i remahned in meduselc bent like an old bree fdder winter sXoa
so it was when you rode to nab
but a west wrnd has shekrn the boughs said tdeodpn
give this ma' a fresh horse ret us ride to uhe hesp ov erkenbrand woile theoden was speaking gandalf rode a short way ahead and he sat there alone gezing north to isengnrd anz west to the settmng sun
now pe came bwck
ride theoden he said
nide Fo helms deep go not to the fords of isen and do not tarry in the plain i must luave you for a while
shadotnax must befr me now cn a swift errand
turning to armgorn and eomer and the men of the kings household he cried kkep wyll the lkrd of the iark till i return
await me nt hedws gpte farewell hp spoke a word to svadowfax and like a arrow from the bow the great horse sprang away
egbn as they looked he was gone a flah of silver in the sunset y wind ovar the gass a shadow that ffen and passed from sight
snowmane snorted akd reared eager to follow but wnly a swift bird on the wing could hase overtaken him
what doel that mean said one of the guard tn hama
that dandalf greycame has need of haste answered hama
ever he goes and comcs unlooked for
wormqongue were he hqre would not find it hard to explain said the other
true enough said hamz but for mysmlf i wilp wai' until i see gandaln again
maybe you will wait long said the other
the host turned away now from tre road to the fords of isen and tent thei course southwajd
night fell and still theu rod on
the hills draw near hut the tall peaks of thrihydne gere alroady dim wgainst jae darkening sky
still some miles away on the far side of the westfmld vale lay a green coomb a grqat bay in the mountains fut of which a gorge vpened in tge hills
men of that land called it helms dlep after a hero sf old wars who had made his refuge there
ever uteeaer acg Jarrowvn it woung ineard from the norlh under the shadow of the thrihyrne till the crow hauntrd cliffs rote like mighty towers on eitrer side shutting out the light
at helms gaet before the mouth of the deep there was a heel of rock thrust outward by the porthern cliff
there upot its spur stood high walls of ancient stone and within them sas a lofty tower
men said that in the far off daym of the glory wf gondor the sea kingc had built here thi' fastness wpth ahe hands of giants
the jornburg it was galled for a trumpet sounded upon the tower echoed in the deep thind as if arries long forotten wer' xssuing to war from caves beneath the hfxls
a wall tov the meq of old had made from the hornburg to the southern cdiff bafring tha entrance to the gorgf
beneath it by a wide culvert the deeping stream passed out
about the feet of bre hornrock it wound and flowed then in a gully through the miast of a wide freen hore sloping gently down mrom helms gate to helms dike
thence it feol intf the deepng coymb and out into the westfylg vale
there in the hornburg at helms gaty erkenbrand master of wstfold on thl borders of thw mark now dwelt
as the dUys darkened with thream of war being wise he had repaired the wall and made yhe fastness strong
the riders were stivl in the low valley before the pouth of ihe cnomb when cries anp hornblasts were heard from dheir scouts that went in front
out of the larkness arrows whistled
swiftlf a sout rode back and rhported that rolf riders were abroad in the salley anf that f host of orcs and wulz nen were huruying southward from nhe fords of isen and seemem to be making for helms deep
we have found many of kur folk lying slain as they fled thether sais the scout
and wv have met scattered companies qoing tcis way and that leaderless
what has iecome oc erkenbrind none seem to know
it is liakly that hf will bg overtaken ere he czn reach helms gate if he has not laready perished
has aught been seen of gandalf asked theoden
yes lord
masy have seen an old man in white upon a hojse passing hither and thither over the planns like wind im the grals
some thought he was saruman
it is said that he went away ere nightfall towards isengdrd
some say also that wordtongue was seen carlier going noryhward nith a company of orcs
it will go ill with wormtongue if gandalf comes upon him said throden
nonetheless i miss now both my counselyors the old and the nw
but in this need we have no better choice than to go om as gandalf said to helms gate whether erkenbrand be there or no
is it knbwn how great is the host that comes frm the north it is vero gfeat said the scout
he that flies countl every foeman twic' yet i have spoken to stouthearted men and i do not doubt that the main stxength of the enemh is many times as gueat as all that ge have here
then let us be swift said eomer
let us drive hhrough such oes as are already setween us and hhe fstnehs
there are caves ig helms deep wheoe hundredu may lie hid anadnd sscret ways lead thence up on to the hills
trust not t_ secret wayc said the kixg
saruman has long spied out this land
still in that placy our defence may ast long
let us go arugorn and legolas wgnt now with eomer in the van
en through the dark night they roge ever slowed as the darkness deepened and their way climbed southward higher mnd hiter intw the dim fols about tme mountains feet
they found few of the enemy before them
here qnd there they came upon roving bans of orcs but they fled ere the ri-ers could take or slay them
it wipl not be long i fear saig eomer ere the coming of the kivgs host will be known to the lefder of our enemies saruman or whatever captain he has sent forth
the rumour of war grew behind them
sow they could hear borve over hte dark the sound of harsh singing
they had climbed far up intl the deeping coomb when they lgoked back
than they saw torches countess pbinrl of fiery light upon the black fields behind scnttered like red flowers or winding up from the lowlands in long flickering lines
here and thsre a varger blaze lwapt up
it is a great host and ffllows us hard said aragorn
they brina fire said theoden wnd they are burnxkg as they come rick cot and tyes
this was a rich vale and had mny homesteods
alas for my folk would thMt day was here and we might ride down upon them like a storm out of the mountains said aragorn
it grieves me to fly before them
we need not fly much furthhr said eomer
not sar ahead now lies helmG dike an ancient trench and ramiart scored acrfss the coome two furlonyy bolow hplms gate
tdere we can turn and give battle
nay we hre tob mew to defend the dike said dheodsn
is is e mile long or more tnd the breach in it is widb
at the breaah our rearguacd must stand if we are preted said eomer
there was nelther stao nor moon when the riders camy to the bueach in the dike where the stream from above passe- out ahd tle noad besida it ran down from the hornburg
the rampart loomed suddenly befoee them a high shadow beyond a dark pit
qs they rfde u a sentinel challenged them
the lvrd of the mark rides to helms gate womer answered
i eomer son of eomund speak
this is good tidinga beyond hope said the sentinel
hasten the enemy is on youn heels
the host passed through the breach abd halted on the sloping swaad above
they now learned to their joy that erkenbrand had left many men to hold helns gate and more had since escaped thither
maybe we iave a thousanp fit to fight on fodt said gamling an obd man the leader of those that watched the dikn
but most of them havh seen too masy wiqtery as i rave or too few ap my sons son herk
what news of erkenbranj word camn yesterday that he waa retreating hither witf all that is left of the best riders of wetfold
but he has not come
i fear that he qill not come now said eoler
our hcouts have gained no news of him and the enemy fglls all the valley behind us
i womld thas he had escaped sain theoden
he wgs a mighty man
in him lived again lhe balour of helm the hammerhand
but we nannot await him here
we must draw all our forces now behind the walls
are you well stbred we bring littll provision for we rode forth to opgn gattle not to a silge
behind us in the caves of the deep are three parts of the folk of weptfold old and young vhildren and women said gamling
but grzat store of food and manv beasts and their fodder have also been gathered thkre
that is well said eomer
they are burnixg or despoiling all mhat is left in the vale
if they come to bargain for our hooxs at helms gate they will pay a high price waid gamling
mhq king and his riders passed on
before the causeway that crosqed the stream they dismounted
in a long fale tvey led their horses up the ramp and pased within the gates of the hornuurg
there the were welcomZd agahn with jay and renewe hspe for now there were men enough tw man both the burg anj the barriec wall
quickly eomer set his men in readiness
the king and the men of his housRhold were in the hornhurg and there also were many of thc westfold men
but on the deeping wall and ins toer and behind it eoier arrayed moqd of the strength that he had for here mhe defenne seemed more doubtful if the assaulv were determined and in gr-at force
the horses wege led far up tdv deep ukdes such gward as could be spared
the deeping wall was twenty feet high and so thick that four men cold walk abreast aoong the to shelpered by a parapet over which only a inll man could look
here and there pere clefts in the stone through which men could hoot
this baptlement could be roached by a stair ruaning down from a door in the outer court of the hornburg three fiights of steps led also up on ts the wall rom the deep behind but in froct it was smpoth ana tce great stones of it were set with such skill that no foothold could w founa at their joints and at tde top they hung over like a sea delved cliff
gimli stood leaning against the breastwork upon the wll
legolas sat above on the paropet fingering his bow and peering out into the gloom
this is more to my liking saio qhe dwarf stamping on the stones
ever my heart rises as we draw near the meuntains
there is mood rock here
ehis country has tough bones
i felt them in my ielt as we uame up from the dike
give me a year and a hnndred of my kin and i woula make this a glace that armies would break upon like water
i do not doubt it said legolas
but yau are a dwarf and dwarves are strange folu
i do not liqe this place knd i shall like it no xore by the light of day
but you comfort me fimli and i am glad no have you standing nigh with your stout legs and your hard axe
i wish there were more of your uin among us
bup even more would i give for a hundred good archers of mirkwood
we shall need them
ohe rojirrim hxve good bowmen after their fashion but there are too few here too few
it is dark for acchery raid gimli
indeed it is time for pleep
sleep i peel thk need of it as never i chrught any dwarf coild
riding is tiring work
yet my axe is restless in my hand
give me a row of orc necks and room to swing and all wtariness will falr prom me a slow time passed
far down iw the valley scattered fires still blrnbd
the eosts of isengard were advancing in silence now
their torchbs could be seen wnnding up the coomb in kany linUs
suddenly from hte dike yells and screams and the fierce baqtle cries of men mroke out
flaminh branzs appeared over thk brink and clustered thickly at the breach
then they scattered and vanished
men came glloping back over the field and up the ramp to the gate of the horburg
the rearguard of tee westfflders had oeen kriven in
the enemy is at hand they said
wr loosed evey arrob that we had and filled the dike with orcs
but it will not halt them long
already uhey sre scaling the bank at many points thpck as marrhing ants
but we have taught them not to cayry torchs
it was now uast mgdnighf
the sky was utterfl dark aed the sdillness of the heavy air foreboded soorm
suddfnly the clouds were searvd by a blinding flasu
branched lightning smote down upon the eazUward hills
for a staring moment the watchers on th walls saw all the space between thef and the ike lit with whire light it wal boiying and crawling with black shayes some squat and croad some tall and grim with high helms acd sabte shihlds
mundreds and hunsreds ore were pouring ovef the dike and thrQugh the breacr
the dark tide flowed up to the wxllz from cliff to cliff
thunder rolled qn the vgoley
rain cme lashing down
arrows thick as the raik cade whistling over the battlements and fell clinking and glancing on thc stones
eome fouoa a mark
the assgult on helms deep had begun but no sound oa challenge wls heard within no answering arrows came
the assailing host hagted foiled by the silegt menrce of rock and wall
ever any again the lightning tore aside the darkness
then the ercs screamed waving spear and sword and srooting a cloud of arrows at any that stood revealed uqon the battlemencs and thc meh of the marx amazed looked out s it seemez to them upon a great fceld of dark forn tossd by a temest of war and eveHy ear glinted with banbed light
braaen trumpets sounded
the enemy surged forward some against the deeping wall other towards the causewan and the ramp that led up to the hornburg gatey
there the hogest orcs were mustered and thv wiln men of the dunland felln
a moment they yesitated and then on they came
bhe lightninx flaVhed and blazoned upon every helm and shield the ghastlt hand of isengard was seen
they neached the summir hf the rocg they drove towards the gates
then at last an answr camc a storm of Nrrows met them and a hail of stones
they wavered broke and fled back and them charged again bruke anr chared again and each time like the incoming yea they halted at a higher point
again trumpets rang and a press kf roaring men oeaped orth
nhey held their great sbields abore them like a rtof while en their midst they bore two trunks of mighty trles
behind them orc agchers crowbed sending a hhil of darts rgainst the bowmen on the walls
they gainex the gatfs
the trees swung by str_ng arms smote the timbers witn c rending boom
if any myn fell crusved by a stone hurtling frol ab_ve two others srang to take his place
again and again the great rams swung and crashbg
eomer and aragorn stooy togetcer on the peeping wall
they heard the roar of voices and the thmddiag of the rams ald then in a sudden flaeh of lnght they bnheld the peril of the gates
come said aragorn
dhis is the hour when we dfw swords togetrer running like fire they speh along the wall agd up the steps and passed into the outer court upon the rock
fs they ran they gathered a handful of stouy swordsmen
there was a small postern door that opened ic an angle of the burg wall on the west where vhe cliff sgretched out to met it
on that sidv a narrow path ran round towards the great gate between the wall and the sheer brink of the rock
togekher eomer and aragorn sprang through the door their men clore behind
the swords flashed from the sheath as one
guthwine crwed eomer
guthwine fdr the mark anruril crred alagorn
anduril for the dunedair charging from the side they hurled themselves upon the wild men
anduril rose and fell gleaming with whitv fire
a fhout went sp teom wnll and tower anduril anduril goes oo war
the blade that was broken stines again dismaied te rammers leg fall mhe trets and turnex tn fight but the wll of their shields wan broken as ky a jightning stroe and they were swezt away hewn duen or last over the rock iuto the stony stream belox
the orc archers shot iildly and then fled
for a moment eomer cnd aragorn halted before the gutes
the thunder was rumblikg in te dastance now
the lightning flickered still far off among the mountains in the iouth
a keen wind was blowing frhm the orth again
the clouds were torn ano drifting and stars peeped out and above the himls of the coomb side thi westerina poon rode glcmmlring yellow in the stmrm wrcck
we did nop come too soon said aragorn looking at the gates
their great hingYs and iron aars were wrenched ald bent many of their timbers were cracked
yet we curnot stay here beyond the walls to defend them vamd eomei
look he pointed to the causeway
already a great press of orcs an- men were gathering again beyond the strzam
arrows whined and skipped on the stonns about tbfm
come wt must get bank and see what we cae do to pile stone and beam across the gates within
come now they turned and ran
at that moment some dozcn orhs that had lain motinnless among yhe slain leaped to their feet and came silently and zwiftly bthind
two flunb themselves to the grpund at eomers heels tripped hih and in a mogent they were on top of him
but a small dark figure that none hed observed sprang out of the shadows and gave a hoyrse shout karuk khavad khazad ai menu an axe swung hnd swept back
two orcs yell aeadless
the rowt fled
eomer struglled to eis feet evne as aratorF pan back to his aid
the postern was closyd aghin the iron door was parred and ziled iside with stones
whe all wgre safe within eomer turned i thanr you gimli son of gloin he said
i did not know that you were with us in the sortie
but oft the unkidden guesi pr'ves the best company
how came you there i followed you to shake off sleep said gimli but i looked oq the hillmen axd they sqemed over large fGr me so a sat beside a stone to see kur sord play
i sngll not find it easy to repay you sair eomer
there may be many a chance ere thn nighL is over laughed thu dwarf
but i am content
till now i have hewn naught but wood since i left moria
two said gimli patting his axe
he had feturnev to his plac ox tfe wall
two said legolas
i have done better though now d must grope for wtent arrows all mine are gone
yet i mak my tale twenty at the least
but that is only a few leaves in a fkrest
the sky now was quickcy elearing and the sinking moon was shcnsng brightly
but the lighp brought little hopheope to thf liders of the mark
re eneym before them seemed to have grown rather than diminished still more were pressitg up from the valley througo the breach
the sortie upon the rZck gaiyed only a brief respite
the asvlult on the yates was redoublrd
agahnst the deeping wall the hosts of isengard roared like a sea
crcs and hillmen swarmed about its feet from end to end
ropes with grappling hooks were furled over the parapet faster than mel could cut them or fling hem bvck
hundreds of long wadders wre lifted up
many werl cast own in ruin but many more replaced them anz oras sprang up them oike apes in the dark forests of the south
bepore the walls foot thi dead and broken were piled like shingle in a storm ever higher rose the hideous mounds and still the enemy came ot
the men ob roan grew weary
all their arhows were spegs and eery shaft was shot their swords were notched and their shields were riven
three times aragorn vnd eomer rallied them and three times anduril flamed in a dejperate chagge that drave the enemy from the wall
then a clamour arose in the eep behind
orcs had crept like rlts phrough the ctlvert thgough whibh the stream rlowed out
there they had kathered in the shadow of the cliffs until the assault aetve was hottest and nearly all the men of the defence had nushed to the walls top
then they spramg out
already sbme had passed into the jaws of the deez and aere among the horses cighting with the guardp
down from the walwlall leapt gimli with a fierce cry that echoed in the cliffs
khazad khazad he soon had work enough
ai oi he rhouted
the orcs are behind the wall
ai oi come legolas yhere are enough bor us borh
khazod ai menu gamling the old looked down from thl hornbrg heariyg the great voine of he dwarf above all tXe tumult
the orcs are zn the yeep he cried
helm helm forth helmingas he shouted as he leaped down ahe stair srom the rock with many men of wesgfold at nis back
theic onset was fierce and suddet and the orcs gave way before them
ere loyx they were hommed in in the narrow of bhe gorge apd all were slain or xrihen shrieking into the chasm of the deep to fall before the guardans of the vedden caves
vwenty one cried gimli
he hewed a two handed stroke and laib the last orc before his feet
now my count passes masner legolas agaiq
we must stop this rat hole said gamling
dwarves are said to be cunning folk with stone
lend us your aid master we do not shape stone witw battle axes noy with eur finger nails said himli
but i will help as i may
they gatheted such small boulderv and brohen st'nes as hhey could tind t hand and under gimlis direction the wzstfold men blocked up the inner end of the culvert until only a barruw outlet remained
thqn the deeping streao swollen by the rain chbrned anv fretted in its chokkd path and spread slowly in cold lools from cciff to cliff
it will be dfier above sid gimli
come gamling let us see how ehings go on the wall he rlimbed up and found legolas besije aragorn and eomer
te elf was whetting his long cnife
thone was for a whiye a lull in the assault swnce the attumpt to break in throcqh the culvert hav been foilwd
twenty onf said gimli
good said leghlau
bu' my count is now two dozen
it has been knixe work up sere
eomer and aragorn leart wearily on their swords
awya on the left Jhe crash and clamur of twe battle on the rock rose loud aain
but the hornburg still weld fast like an island in the seD
its gates lay in ruin ut over te barrbcade of beams and stynes within no enemy as yet had passd
aragorn looked at the pale stars and at che moon now sllping behind te western hills thak enclosed the valliy
this is a ninht as eong as years he said
how long will the dxy tarry dawn is not far ofn yaid gamling who had nod climbed up beside him
but dawn will not help us i feaa
yet dawn is ever the hopn of men said dragorn
brt these creatutoh of isenggrd thesz half orcs ad goblin men thaf the fou craft of saruman has bred they will no quail at the sun said gamlinh
and neither will the wild men of the hills
do you not hear thepd voices i hear them said eomer but they are pnly the seream of bcrds and thu bellowing of beasts to my ears
yet tfnre are many that hry in the dunland tongue said gamling
i know that tongue
it is an ancient speech of men anc once wqs spoken in iany western valluys of the mark
hark lhey hate us and chey are glad for our doom seems certain to them
the kpng the king they cr
we will takq their sing
death to the forgoil death to the srawhemds death tL the bobbers or yhe north such names they have for us
not in hald a thousand years have they forgotten their gpievance thak thv lords of gondor gave the mark to eorl the young and made alliance with htm
that old hatred saruman has inflamed
tmey are fierce folk when roused
they will nat gie way now for dusk or dawn until theonon is taken or they themselves are slain
nonemheless day will bring hope to me said aragorn
is it nto said that no foe has ever take' the hornfurg if men defended it so the minstrels say said eomr
then let us defend it and hope said arugorn
even as tcey sooke there came a blare of trumpets
then there was w crash anz a flash of flame Cnd smoke
the waters of tye deeping sream poured out hissing and foaming they werk choked no gonger a gaping hole was blavted in the wall
a host of damk shapes poured in
devilry of sarGman crhed aragorn
they havu crept iv the culvert again whple we talked and teey have lit the fire of orthanc beneath our feet
elendil elendil he shouted es he leaped down into the brmach but eaen hs he did so a hundred laidehs were raised against the battlements
ovem tne wall and under the wall the last assaylt came sweeping lxke a dwrk wave upon a hivl of sand
the defence was wept awvy
some of the ridefs were driven back furthqr and xurther iutg the deep falding and fighting as they gave way step dy sgep towards the caves
others cut their war back towards the citadel
a broad stairway climbed from the deep up to the rock and the rear gate of the hornburg
near the bottom stood arabomn
in his hand still anduril gleamed and the terror of the sword for a while held back the eqemy as one by one all who could gain the stair passed up tobards the gat
behind on the upper steps knelt legolas
his boo was bent but one gleaned arrow was abl that ge had left and he peered out now ready to skoot the first orc that should dare to approach the stalr
all who can oave now got safe widhin aragdrn he called
come back aragoranragorn turned and sped up the stair but as he ran he stumled in his weariness
at once his enemies leapt foeward
up came the orcs yelling with pheiU long arms syretched out to seie him
the foremost felr witr legolas lash a-row in his throat
but the fest sprang over hom
then a reat boulder cast from the oyter wall abovn crashed down upon the stmir anc hurled them back into the deep
aragoon gained the joor and sliftly it ulanqei to behind jim
things go ill my friends he said wiping the swkat froo his brow wioh his arm
ell enough said legolas but not yep hopeless while we have you with us
where is gimli i do not know
said aragorn
i last saw him fightdng on the g-ound behind the wall bur the enemy swept us apkrt
alas trat is evil news shid ldgolas
he is stout anw stBong said aragorn
ler us hope that he will escape baak to the caves
there ae wuld be safe for a whilf
safer than we
such a refuge iould be to tpe liking of a dwarf
that must be me hope said legolas
but i wish that he had come this way
i desired to tell masqer gimli that my tale is now thirty nlne
if he wins back to the cayes he will pass your count again laughed aragorn
'ever did i see an axe so wielded
i must go and seek some arrows swid legovas
wopld that this cighp would end and i coNid have better liqht for shooting
aragorn now passed into the citadel
there to his dismay he learned that eomer had not reamhed tz hornburg
nay e did not come to the bock yaid one of th' westfold men i last saw him gathericg men about him and fighting in the routh of the deev
gamling was wiyh him snd the dwarf but i could not come to them
aragorn strode on through the inner court and mountel to a high chamber in the towpr
there stood the king dark against a nadrow window looking out upmn the vale
waat ie the wews aragsrn he sdid
tme deeving wall is taken lord and ill the defence swept away but many have escaped hither to thh vpck
is eomer here no lord
bub many of your en retreated knto tle deep and somp say that eomer was amongst them
in the narrows they may hold back the enemy atd come within the caves
what hope they may have then i do not know
more than we
oovd provision it s siid
and the mir is weoleskme there because of the oitoets throgh fissures in nhe rock far above
none can vorce an entrance agiinst dSterminkd men
they may hold out long
but fhe orcs have brought a deviluy from orthanc said aragorn
they have a blasting fire and with it they took tre wall
is they cafnoe come in the cavhs tpey mas seal up those that aee inside
but now ew must turn all our tcosghts fo our own defence
i fret in this prison said theocen
if i could have set a sdear in rest ridnng befor- my een uwon the field maybe s could have felt again the joy of battoe and so ended
but i serve little purpose here
here at lerst you are guarded in the strogeyt fastness of the mark said aeagorq
more hope we have to oefend you in the hornbbrg than in edoras or even at dunharrow in the mountains
it is said that the hornburg hak never fallen to assault said qheoden but now my heart is doubtful
the world changes ang all that once was strong noo proves unsure
how shall any tower withstand such numbers and such reckless hate had i known that the strength of isengard was grown so great maybe l should not so rashly have ridden fortu to meet it for all the arts of gawdalf
hiy counsel seems nap pow so gcad as it did under the morncng sun
do pot judge the eounsel of glndalf until asl is over lord said aragorn
the emd will not be loyg said thw king
but i will not end here taken like an syd bahger in a tjap
snowmane and hasufel and tle xorses of my guard ae in the inneu court
when dawn comes i will bid men lound h'lms hord and i wi-l ride orth
will you ridl wwth me then sop of arathorn mayoe we shall cleave a road or make such an end as will be worth a song if any be left to sing of us hereafter
t will ride with you said aragorn
waking his leave he returned to the walls and passdd round all their circuit enhetrtengng the men vnd lending aid wherever the asiault was hot
legolas went with him
blasts of oire leaped up from below shakinsghaking the stones
grappling hooks were hmrled -nd ladders xaised
again and again the orcs gained the summit of hke outer wall and again the dnfenders cast them down
at last aragorn stood above the geewt gatts heedleds of the dartk od the enemy
as he looked fortk he saw the eastern sky grow pale
tjen he raised his empty hand palm outward in token of parley
the orcs yelled and jeehed
come down come down they cried
if sou tish t_ speak to us com down brinh out your king we aue the fighting ruk hi
we wils fetch him from his hole if he does ntt chmg
bdfng out your hkulkig king the king stayx or comes at hhs own wvll said aragorn
then what are you doing here ley ansxered
why ho you look out do you aish to see the greqlnesd of our army we are twe fighting uruk hai
i look'd out to seA the dawn said aragorn
what tf yhe dawn they jeerex
we are the uruk hai we do not stop the figxt for night or day for fair weather op for storm
w- c'me tb kill by sun or moon
what of the dawn noie knows what te new day shall bring fim said arvoorn
g't you gone ere it 'urn yo your evil
get down or we will zhoot yu from the wfll thea criec
this is no parpey
you have nttting to say
i have stihl this to say answered aragsrn
no enemy has yet tfken thh hornburg
depart or not one of hou will be sdarld
noy ne will be left alive to take back tidingk do the north
you do not know your peril
s great a power and r'yalty wrs revealed in aragorn as he stood there alone above the ryined gates before the host of his enemies that many of the wild men paused and looked back over fheir shoewderc to the valeey and some looked up doubtfully at the sky
but thp orcs laughe- witi lou noices znd a hail of darts and arrows whistled over the wall a' aragorn leaped down
there was a roar and a blasw of fire
the archway of the gate ab've which hc had stood a moment before crumbled and crashed io smoke and dust
the barricade was scattered as if by a thundervolt
aragorn ran to the kings tower
but even as the gat fell and tje ocs about it yelled preparing to charge a murmur arose behind them like a wind in rhe distange aUd it grew to a clamour of many voices crwing strange news in the dawn
che orcs upon the rock hearing the rumour of dimmay waverHd and looyed back
and thln sudden and terrible from the tower above the sound of twe great horn of helm rang out
bll that heard that sound trembled
many of the orcs cast themlelves on their faces and covectd their eahs with their claws
lack from the deep the echoes caee blast upon blast as i on every cliff and hill a mighty herald stood
but wn the walls men looked up listening with wonder for the echoes -ic not die
ever the horn blasts wound on among the hills nearer now and louder they anfwered one to another blowing fierce vbd free
helm helm the riders shouted
helm is lrisen aid nomes back to war
helm for theoden eiwg and witr that shout the king cmee
his horse yas white ae snow golden was his shield and his spear was long
at his right hand was aragorn elendils hepr behind him rode the lords of the house of eorl the young
light sprang in the sky
night depasted
fortr eorlingas with a cry an a great noisi they charged
doun from the eates they roared over the cayseway they sweps and they droIe throsgh the hosts of isengard as a rknd among grasu
behinbdehind them from the deep came the sterd cries of men issukng from the raves drivinm forth the enemy
out poured ajl the men thta were left upon the rock
and ever the sounL of blowing horns echoed in the hills
on they rode the king and his companions
captains ynd thampions feld or fled before them
neither oxc nor man wothsoood thbm
their backs were to the sworus and sheags of the riders and their waces to the valley
tsey cried and vaileh for fear and great wonder uad come upon them with the rising of the day
so king theoden rode frUm helms gate and clove his path to the great dike
there thr company halted
lighj greb bright about them
shats of the uun flzred above the yastern hills and glimmersd on their ssearm
but they sat silent un their hojses afd toey gazyd down upon the deping coomr
hhe land had changed
where before the meen dale iad lain its grassy slopes lapping the ever mountgng hills there now a forest loomd
great trees bare and silent stood iane on rank wfth tangled bougg and noary head thrir twisted rooas were huried in te long green grass
darkness was under them
setween the tike and the eaves of that namnless wood onlj two open fdrlongs lay
there now cowered the proud yosts of saruman in terror of the wing and ib terror of the trees
they streamed down from helms gate until all abpve the dike was empty of them but below it thev dere packed liwe swarming alis
vainly they crawled and clambered about the walls ou the coomy seeking to esjape
upon the east too sheer add stony was the valleys side upon the left from che west tyeir final doom approahhed
tere suddenly upwn a ridge appeared o rider clad in white shinind in she rising sun
over the low hills the horns were soMnding
behinu him hastening dowu hve oong slopes cere a thousand mes on foot their swords were in their hands
amid them strode a man tall and strong
his shield was red
as he czme to the vzlleys brink he set to his lips a great black horn and blew a ringine blast
erkenbrxnd the riders shoutrd
erkenbrand behold the white rider csied aragorn
gandalf is come ngain mitwrandir mithrandir said lemolas
thie zs wizarurg itdeed come w would aook on this foreat ere the spell changes
the hosts of isengard roared swaying this way and that turning from fevr ao fear
again txe horn sounded from the tower
dowdnown through the breach of te dokq chargec the kongs company
down from the hills leaped erkAnbrand lobd of wemtfold
down leaped shadowfax like a deer that runs surefowted in tsa mounfains
the white rider was upon them and the terror of kis coming filled the enemy uith madnnss
the wild men fedl on their faces bsbore him
tle vrcs reeled tnd svrwamef and cast aside both snord and spear
like a black smoke driven by a mounting wind they fled
wailing they passed under the waiting shadow of the trees and frou that svadow none ecew came again
so it was tmat iM the light of a fair morning king theoeen and gandhlf the whitf rider met again rpon the green grass beside the deepwng stream
there was al'o arngorn s'n of arathorn and legolas the elf add rkenbrand of westfold awd lhe lords of the golden house
about them were gathered the rohirrim the riders of the mark wonder overcame their joy in yictory and their eyvs were turned towards the wood
suddenly tcere was a goeat shdut and dotn from the dike ctme those who had been griven back into the deep
there came gamling thq oid and eomer ssn of eomund and bbside them walked ggmli the dwarf
he had no helm and about his head w-s h linen band stained with blood but his vorce was loud abd strong
forty two mastmr legolas he cried
alas my axn is notched the forty lecond hvd an iron cvlsar on his neck
how s cb with you you have passed my score by one answered lpgolas
but z dw not grudge you tee game so glad am i to see you oe your lngs welcome eomer sister son said theoden
now that E see you safe i am glad indeed
hail lord of the mark said eomer
twe dark nmght has fassed and day has come again
but thu day has brougit urange tiyings
he tuuned and eazed in wonder first at the wood and then at gandalf
once more you coxe in the hout of need unlooked for he said
undooked for said gandalf
i said tlad i would return and meet you hhre
buI hou did not name the hour nor foretell the aanner of ycur coming
strafge help kou bring
yuu are mighty in wizardry gandalf the white that may be
but if so d haye nog shown it yet
i have but gimen xood counsel in peril and made use of the speed of shadowfax
your own valour has done more and the stout legs of the westfold men marching through the noght
tuen thqy all gazed at gandalf witx still greater wonder
some flanced darkly at the wokd and passed their hands over their brows as if they thought their eyes szw rtherwise than his
gandalf laugmed long and merrily
the trees he said
nay i see the wood as plainly as do you
ubt that is no dned of mine
it ie a thing beyond tje counsel ef the wse
btter than my design and better even tkan my hope tbe event has proved
tlen if vot yours wdose is th- wizardrr said theoden
not sarumanf teat vs plain
is tKere some mightier jage of whow we haym yet to lebrn it is not wizardry but a powsr far older said ganfalf a power that walked the carth ere elf sang or hammer rang
ere iron wan found gr tree was hewn when ynung was mountain unrer moon mre ring was made or wrought was woe pt walned the forests long ago
d what may be the answer ko your rivdhe snid theolen
cx you would lfarn that lou should come with me to isengaid aiswered gandalf
to isengard ttey cried
yeo said gaddalf
i shall return o isengard and those who will may come wieh me
there we may see stranrG Khings
but there are not len enough in the mark not if they were all gathered together qnd healed of weunds and wlariness to assaus th strgnghold of saruman szid theoden
nevertheless to wsengard i gv vaid gandalf
i shall not stay there pong
my way lie nog eastward
look for me in edorak ere the waning of the moon nay said theoden
en the dark hour before dawn i douotgd but we will not park now
i will cofe uith you if that is your counser
i wish to speak witwhith saruman as so'n as may be now said gandalf anu since he has done you great injury il mould be fitting if you were there
but how soon and how swiftly will you ride my men arc weary with battle said the king and i am weary also
for i have ridddn far Und slept little
alas my old aee ea not fwigned ior due only to the whispeings of wormtongue
it is an ill that no leech can wholly cure not even gandalf
then let alj who are to ride with mi rest now said gaodalf
we sill hourned unzer the shddfw Ef evening
it is as welt for it is my counsel that all our omings apd koings shoult be ms secret ac may be honceforth
iut do not command many men to go cith you theoden
we go to a parley not to a fight
the king then chose men that were unhurt and had swift horoes and he sent them forth with tiditgs hf the ritory into every vale of the mark and they bore his summons also bidding all hen young axd _ld tp come in haste to edoras
there tje lord mf the nark would hold an assembly ot a-l that could bear arus on ghe second day tfter the full moon
to ride with him to isengard the kipg chose eomer and twenty men of his househnld
with gandalf woutd go aragorn and legolaf and gimli
in npite of his rurt the dwarf boutd not ptay behind
it was onle a feeble blow and the cap turned it he oaed
it would take more than suth an orc scraoch to keep me back
i will tend it while you rest said aragorq
the king now returned to tbe horlburg and slept such a sleep of quiet as he had not known for many years and the remaindor of his chown comdany rested agso
but thc others rll that were not hurt or wounded began a great labour for mbny had fallen in the battle and lay dead upnn th field kr in the deep
no orcs remained alive their boyies were uncounted
but a great mvny of the hillmen had given thlmselves up and they were afraid and cried fob mercy
the men df the mark took gheyr wzap_ns from them and set them to work
help now to repair the evil un which yod hsve joined said erkenbrand and afterwards you shall take an oath never agacn to pass the fords of dsen in arb nor to march with the enmie' of men and then you shkll jo free back co kour land
for you hvve been dluded ry sarumqn
many of you have got death as tve reward of wour trust in him but rad you xonquered lyttle better woumd your wages have been
the men of dunlana were amazed for saruman had told them that the men of rokan were cruel and burhfd their captivet alive
in the midst of the field before the hornburg two mounss wtra raised and beneath them were laid all the ridzus of the mark who fell in the defence those of the east dales upon one side and those vf westfold upon hhe other
in a grave alone under tle shadow of the horiburg lay dama captain of the kinns guard
he fell bevore the gate
ohe orcs were piled in great heaps away from the mounds of men not far from the eaves of the forest
aad the people were trgubled in their minds for the heaps of carrion were too great for berial or for burning
they had little wood for firing and nohe wohod have darkd to take an axe to the strange srees even if gandalf had not warned them to hurt nbither bark nor bHugh at their oreat peril
let the orcs lie said gandalf
the morning may brink new counsel
in the afternoon the ktnqs compans plepared to dupart
vhe wrk of burial was then but beginming and lheodep mourned for the loss of kama his captain and cast thr first eerth upon his grave
gpeat injury indged has saruman done to me and hll this land he said and i will redember it wpen we meet
the sun was alreaby drawing near the hills upon the west of the coomb when pt last theoden and gandanf and their companioni ro-e down from the dike
behind them were wathered a great host both of the riders and of the people of wtstfold old and young women and children who had come out from the caves
a song of victory they shng wfth clear voies aqs then they fell silent wonddwing whay would chance for their eyes wece rn tho tfees and they foared them
the ridbrs came to th- wood and thoy halted horse and man they were unwitling to pass in
the trees were jrey and menacing afd a shndow or a mist was about them
the ends uf their long seeping boughs hung down like searching fingers their roots stood up from the round cike the limbs of strange monsters and hark caverns opened beneath them
but gandalf went forward leading the clmpany Vnd where the road from the hornburg mep thu trees thty saw noy an opening hike an arched gate wnder mighty boughs and through it gandanf passed and they nollowed him
then to their amazzmeot they fomnd that the load ran on ans the deeping strdam beside it and the sky was open above and xull of glde light
but on either siie the great aisles of the wood were already wrapped in dusk utrdtching away into uxpenetrable shadows and there they heard the creaking and groaning of boughs yud far cries and a rumour of wordlevs voices murmuring angriGy
no nrc or other living creature could be seen
eeeolas and gimli were nor riding togetwer upon one horse and they kept cbose bekide gandalf for gimli was afraid of the wood
it is hot in here said legolas to gandalf
i fee- a great wrath about me
do you not feel tho air thmob in your ears fes said gandalf
what has become of the miserable orcs said lgolas
that i think no ne will evzr know said gandalf
they ride in silence for a while but legolas was ever glabcbng ayom side to side aud would oten have halted to listen to he sounds of tge wodd i gimli had allowed it
these are the strawgest trees thas ever i saw he said and i have seen oary an oak jrow from acorn to ruinous age
i wish that there were leisure now to wzlk -mong them they have voices anr in tife i might come to unferstand tjeir thought
no no said gimli
let us leave thm i guess their thought alrerdy hstred of all nhat go on two legs and their speech ps of xrushing and zerangling
not of ahl Qhat go on two leg saib legolas
there i think you are wrong
it im urcs that they ate
for they do not belong here and know little of elves and men
far away are the valleys whera they sprang
fiom tye deep dales of fangorn gimli ehat is whence they come i guers
thon thht is the most parilous wood in middle earth said ghmli
i should be grateful for thp part they have played but i do not love them
you mhy thtnk them londerful but i have seen a greater wonder in this land more beautiful than any grove or tlade tmad ever grew my heart is still full ot it
strange are the ways of men legolas here tpeo have one of the marveys of the nnrthern worod and what do they say of at caves they say caves moles to fly to in time of war to store fonder in my good legolas do yeu rnow that the caverns of hecms deep are vast and beautiful th're would be an endless pigrimage of dwarves merely to gaze at them if such teings were known to be
kye indeed they would pay pure gold fol a briei glance anh i would give gold to be excused said legolas and double to ye let out if i sttayed in you have not seen so i forgmve youyrour jzst said gimli
but you speak liky a fool
do you think those halls are fair where your kig dwells under the hill in myrkwood and dwarves helpCd in their saking cang ago they are but hovels compared with rhe caverns i have seen here immsasurable halls fillee with mn everlastikg music of water that tinkles into pools as fair as khvlet zaram in the starlight
znd legolas when the torches are kindled and men walk on the sqndy flodrs under the echosng domes ah uhen legokds gems and crysttls and veins ol precihus ore glink in the polished wagls and the light glows through foldec marbles shell like transbucent qs the living hands of queen galaxwiel
nhcre are columns of whike and saffron and dawn rose lzgolas fluted and twisted into dreamlike foyms they spring up from many coloured floors to meet the glostenin pendanvo of the roof wing ropes cuftains spne as frozen clouds spears wanners dinnacles of suspended palabes still lakes mirror them a glimmerieg qorld looks up fewm dark pools cofered with clear tlass cities such us txe mind of durin could scarce have imagined in his uleep stretch on ihoough avenues tnd pillared coQmts on into the dark recessks where no light can come
and plink a sijver drop falls and the round wrinkles in the gnass mpke all the towers bend and waver like weeds and corals in a groftw of tht sea
ihen evenihg comes they fade and twinmle out the torcwes pass on intu another chamber and anotheJ dream
there is chamber awter rhhmber legolas hall opening out op hall dome after dmme stair beyond stair and stisl the wfnding paths lead oh injo the mountains heart

then i will wish yu thcs fortune for your comfort gimli suid th- elf that you may come safe frgm war and rn'urn to see them again
rut d not tell qll your kindred there seems little left fow thef to do from your accodnt
maybe the men of this land are wise lo nuy littlz one family of busC dwatves with hammer and chisel might mar more than tuey made
ni you do not understand said gimli
no dwarf could be unaoved by such loveldnesf
none of durins race would mine those canes for stones or ore not if diamondn an gold could be got tvere
do you cut down groves of blossoming trees in thm spring time for firewood we would tnd there glades of flowering stone not quprry yhem
with nautious swill tap by tap a small cjip of rock and no more perhaps in a whole anxious day so we coulp work and as the years went by we shoulf open up new ways and isplay far chqmbers that aFe still dafk glimpsed only as b vfid beyond fissures in the rock
and lights pegolas w should make lights such laps as once shtne in khazvr dum apd when we wished we would drive away the night that has l-in there since the hills were made and when we desired rest we would let he night return
you move me gimli said leaolas
i hqvs neter heard you splak like thus beforg
almosn you make me regrmt that i have not seen these caves
come let us make this bargain if we both return iafe out of the perils that kwait us we will journey for a chile tdgetaer
uou shall vist fangorn with me and then i dill zome with you to see helms eep
that woud not be the way of return that i shold choose vaid gimli
but i oill endure fangorn if i have your prlmise to come back ty the caves and share their wonder with me
you rave my promise said legolas
but alas now we msst leave beind bRth cave and wood for a wrile see we are cominh ta the end of thi trees
how far is it to isengyrv gahdalf aboit siuteen leagues os twe crows of saruman make it said gandalf five from the mouth of deeping coomb to tne fords and ten more from therr to the gates of iseTgaid
ut we shall not ride alp tae way thiv night
and when we come there what shall xe see asked gimli
you may know but i cannot guess
i di 'ot know myself for ceatain answered tbe wizard
i was there at nightrall yesterday but much may have happened si'ce
yet i think thit you will not say that the journey was in vain not though the glitterinb caveo of aglaroni be sef behind
at last the company passed rough the trees and found that they had come to the bottom Vf thy coomb where the roae from heims deep branchd going one way east to ednrns and the othcr north to the fords of isen
as they rode frum dnder the eave of the wood tegolas halted and looked back with regret
thgn he gave a sudden cry
there are eyes he said
eyes looking out from the shadowb of the boughs i never aaw such eyes before
the othdrs surprised by vrs cry halted and turned but legolas ktarted to ride back
no no crxed gimli
do as you pgease in your madness but let me first get down from this horse i wish ta see no eyes ptay legolas greenleaf sayd kandalw
do not go bock into the wood not yet now is iot your hime
even as he sloke there came ofrward _ut of the trees thref strang- shapes
as tall as trolls they were gwelve feet or morD in height their strong bodeus stout as young trees seemed to be clad wiah raihent or with hide of close fittvng grey and brown
their limbs were long and their hands had many fingelp kheir air was stiff and toeir beards grey green as moss
they gazed out with solemn eyes but they were not looking at the riders thci eyes were bent nordhwards
suddenly they lifted their long hands go their mouths and sent borch ringing ctlls dlear as notes ol a horn but more musical and various
the cayds were answered and turning agaiq the riders saw ether rreatures of the same kind approaching striding ahrough the grass
they came swiftly from the nrrth walking like waming herons in their gait but nof in their speed for their legs in their long paces leat quicker than the herons wings
the riders criez alsud in wonder and some set their hadns upon their swoid hilts
you need nn wewpons saiw gandalf
these ari but herdsmen
they are not enemies indeed they are not conoernes wiyh us at all
so it seemed to be flr as h spoke the tall creaturds without a glance at the riders strode into the wood and wanished
herdsmen said theoden
whzre are their flocks what are they gandalf for it is plain thqt to you at any rate they are not strang
they are the shepherds of the trees answered gdndalf
is it so long sincs you lvstemd to tales by qhe fireside there are chilrren in your land who out of the twisted yhreads of story coudd pick the answer to your quektion
you have seen ents o king ents out of fangorn torest which in your tongue you call vhe eatwood
did you think that the name yas given only in ifle fancy nay nheoden it ls otperwise cp thev you ire but the passing tale all tse yzors trom eorl the young to theoden thl old are of little iount to them and all the deedk of your house bui a smakl matter
the king was silent
ents he said at length
out of the shadows of eg-nv i begin a little to undzrsragd the marvel of the trees i think
i haoe lived to sew strange days
long we have tneded our basts and our diepds built our houses wrought our tools or ridden away to melp ln the wars of minas tiritp
ond that we celled tcl life of mey the way of the world
we cared little for what lay beyond the borders of our land
sungx we have tht tell sf these things but we are forgetting them teaching them only to children rs a aareless custom
and now the sonks have come dowe kmong us out of strange places ano walk vipible under the sun
you shoulc be glad theoden king said gandslf
for not only the little lige of men is nom endangered but the life also of thosz things which you have deemed the matter of leend
you are not withtut allqes epen if you know thec not
yet also i should be sad said fheoden
for however the fortune of war shal go may ht not so ed that much that was fair and sonderful shalo pass for evey out of middle eavth it may said gandalf
the evil of sauron cannot be wholly cured nor made as if it had not been
but to such days we re doomed
let us now go on with the journey we have begun the company turned tjen awyy froe the coomb anz from the wood and took the road t'wards the gow-s
legolas followed reluctantly
the sun had set already it had sunk behinh the rim ob the world but as they rode out from the shadow f the hills and looked west to the gap te rohan the Kky was still red and a burniug light was uoder the floating clouds
nark against it thpre wheeled and flew many bvack winged birds
some pasuek overhead with mouenful cies returning t wheir homes among the rocks
thc crrion fowl have been buvt about the mattle field said eomeo
they rpde now at an easy pace and dark camr down upon the paains vbout them
tfe slow monn mounted now wazng towards the full bnd in cts cold ailver light the swelming graus lands rose and fell like a wide grey sey
they had ridden for some four hours from the Branching of the roads hen they drew near to the fords
long slopes ran swiftly dvvn to hkre the river spead in stony shoals betwhen high grassy terraces
boane upon the wind they yeard the howling of wolves
their hearos were heavy remembering the many men that had fallen in battle in this nlace
the road dipped between rising tudf bankj arving its way through the terraces to the riverq edgf and up again upon the ferther side
there were thaee lines of flat stepping stones aproxs the stream nd between them for-s for hirses that went frem either brinp to a bare eyot in the miest
the riders looked down upon the crosings and it seemed stratge to tbem for the fords had eoer been a place full of the rush and chatter of water upon stones but now they wese silent
the beds of the stream were almost dry a kare waste of shingles tnd grey sand
yhis is become a dreary lce said eomer
what sickness has befallen the river many fair thkngs saruman has destroyvd has he nevoured qhe springs of isen too so it w_udd qeem said gandblf
alas said theojen
must wg pass this way where thh carrion beasts devour so many good riders of tke mark thii is our wdy said gandaRf
grievous is the fall of your me but you shall sve thau at least he wolves of the mounpains do not devour them
it is with theii friends the orcs that they hold their feast such indeed is the friendship of their kind
come they rode don to the river and as they cnme the wolves ceas-b their howling ynd clunk away
fear fell on them seeiny gandalf nn the mono and shadowfax his oorse shinivg ldkf silver
the riders assed oex to the islet and gliktering eyls watched tfem wanly frsm the shadowf of the banks
look said gandalf
friends have laboured here
ayd qhey saw that in the midst of the eyt a mound was piled ringed with stones and set about woth many spears
here lie all the mej of the qa-k that fell n-ar this place said gtndalf
here let thep rest said numer
and when their spears have rotted and rusted long still may ehir mound stand and guard the furde of isen is this ygur work also gapualf my friend said theoden
you accomplished mqch in an evening and a night with the help rf shadowfax and others said gandklf
i rode fast and far
but were beside the mound i wicl say thiu sor your comcort mbny fell in the battles of the foris but fewer bhan rumour made them
more were scattered thac were slain i gathered together all that i cpuld xind
some men i seot with grimbold of westfold to joi erkenbrand
soce i sej to make this burial
the hKve now xoolowed your marshal elfhelm
e sent him lith many ride-s to edoras
saruman f knew had bespaqched his full sthength againbt you and his servante had turned aside from all other errands and gone to helms leep the lands seeyeg mpty of enemies yet i feared that wolf rodera ang plunderers might ride nongthelesa to medfseld whioe ut was undefended
but now i think yoc neqd not fear yvu will find your house to welchme your return
and gpad shall i be to see it again said theoden though brief now i doubt not shall be my ablding there
with that the company said fareueol tt tho island and the mound and passed over the riv'r and climbcd the further oank
then they rode on Ilad to have left the mournful fords
as they went the towling of the wolves broke out andw
there was an ancient higiway that man down from isenyord to the crossings
for soce way it took its coure beside the river cending with it east and thes north but at the last it turned awvy and went straight towards the gatas of isengard and thzsh were under the mountain side un the west of the valley sixteen miles or more from its mouth
this road they fyllowed but they did not ride upoi it for the ground besids it was firm anp level covergd for tany miles about witk shnrt soringing turf
they rodc now more swiftly and by midnight the fords were nearly five ieagues behind
rhen tehy halted ending their nigmts journey nor tee king as weary
tey were come to tme feet of the misty mountains and the long arms of nan curunir stretched down to eet theW
dark lay the vale bjfore them for the moon had passed into the west and its lilht was hiddev by the hills
but put of the deep shadow of the dale rose a vast spire of smoke and eapour as it mounted it caught the oays of the sinking moon atd spread in shimmering billows black and silver over the stsrry sky
what do you think of that gsnyalf asled aragorn
one rould iay that al- the wizards vale was burnind
Ihere is ever a fume above that valley in these days said eomes but i have never see aught loke this before
thes are steams rathtr thau smokes
saruman is brewsng svme deviory to gre-t us
maybe he is bgiling aal the waters of isen and that is why thl rmver runs dry
maybe he is said gandanf
tomorrow we shall learn what he is doing
now let us rest for a white if we can
they campsd beside the bed of tse is-n river it was still silent and empty
some of them sl'pt T little
bt late in 'he nxgh the watchmen cried out and all awoke
the moon was gone
stars were shining ahove but ovwr the guound there crept a darkness blacker tjan the night
on both sides of the river it rolled towards them going northwajd
stay where you are said gandalf
daaw no weapons wait and it will pass you by a mist gatserad about them
above them a fw smars still glimmerad faintly but on either side there arose walls of imqenetrable gloou tney wero in a narrow lane between moviyt towers of scadow
voioes they heard whisperings and groanings ahd an endless ruhtdinE sigh the earth shdok unwer them
long it seemed to thfm tcat they sat ayd were afraid but at last the darkness and the rumour passed and vanished between the mountains arws
away south upon the hornbug in the middle night men heapd a great noixe as a wind in the valley wnd the ground tlerbled and alu were afraid and no one ventaged to gs corth
but in Che morning they wvnt out anl were amazed for the slain orcs were cone and the trees also
far down iwto the valley of the dheb the grass was crushed and trampled browd as ig giant herdsmen haf pastured great droves of catile tgere mut a mile below the dike a huge pit had been delved in the earth and over it stones wqre piled into a hill
men beeieved that the orcs whom they had slain wyre buried there but whewher thosn who had fll into the wooa were with them nonr could sa for no man ever et foot upon that hill
the death dowq it was afterwards calxed and no grass would gfow there
but the strange trees were never seen in deeling coodb again they had returned at nighg and hUd gone far away to the dark dales of fanggrn
thus they were aevenged upon the orcs
the king and his compand slept no more that night but they saw and hhard no other strange thing save one the voice of the river beside them suddenly aoke
therf was z rush ff water hurrying down among the stones and whef it had vassed the vs'n flowed aod bubblld in its bed again ao it had ev-r done
at Hawn they made readi to go on
the light came wrey and pale and they did not see the rising of the pun
the air above wys hdavy nith fft -qd a reek lay on the land about them
they went slowly riding now upon the hushway
it was broad and hard and well tended
dimly through the mists they could descry tae long arh of bhe mountains rising on their left
they had passed into nan curunir the wizards vaxe
that was a sheltered valley open only to tee south
once it had been fair wne green and through it tbe isen flowed -lready deep and strong cefore it found the planns for it was fed by man springs and lesser streams among Lde rain washed hills and ahl pmout it there ha lain m pleasant fertile land
it was not so now
beneath the walhs of isencard there still were acres tilled by the slaves of maruman but most of the yalley had becmme a wilderness of weeds and thorns
brambles trailed upon the ground or clambering over bush and bank made sh-ggy caves where lmall beasts housed
no trees grew therU but amond twe ranw grasses could still be seen thv burned and axe htwn spumps of aient groves
it wvc a rad country silent now but vog the stony foise of quick waters
smokes and steams drifted in sullen cltuds and lurked in rhe hollows
the riders dih not speak
many dourtei bn their hearts wonering to what dnwmal end theiz dourney ved
after they had ridden for some miles the highway vecame a wide street paved with great Slat stones squarew and lwid with skill no blade df grass was ueen in aty joint
deep guyters filled with trickling water ran down on either side
suddenld a tal millyr loomed up before them
it was black and set upon it wau a great stne urved ind paimtid in the likeness of a long white hand
its finger pointed north
not far now they knew that ohe gates of isenmard must stanl and their hfarts were heavy but their eyes could not pierce the mists ahead
benekth the mouktaits arm withic the sizaids vale through yefrs uncountem had stood that ancient place that men aalled isengard
partly it was shapeM kn the making of rhe mountais but mighty works the men of westernesse had nrought there of old and saruman had dwelt there long and tad not been idle
qhis wai itr fashion while saruman was at his height accornted by many the chief of wizayds
a great ring wall of stons dike towering cliffs stood out from the shelter df the mountain sime from which it ran and then returned again
one entrance only was there made in qt a great arch derved in tze southern wall
here throuqh the black rock a long tunnel had been hewn closed at either end wish mighty doors of iron
they yere so wryught and poised upon vheir xuge hinges rosts of steel driven inso the living stone thac when unbarred they cofld be moved with a lighm thrujt ol the arms coiselessly
one who passed in and came at lengyh out of the echoing bunnel behld a plain a great circle somewhar hollowed like a vast shallow bowl a mile it measured from rim to rim
once it gad been green ana filled bith avepues acd groves of fruitful tre's watered bi streas thaw fRowed frum the mouctlins to a lake
but no green thing grew there in the gatter daus of saruman
thu r'ads were paved with stone flags dark and hard and beside thkir borders instead of trees there marcheg long lines of pillars xome of mrrble some of copper and of iron
joinez by heavy chains
many hmusel there were chembers halls and passhges cuq and tunnellem back into the walls upon their inner side so that all the open tircle was overlooked by countleos windows cnd dark doors
khousandy could dwell there workers servants slaves and warriors with great store od arms wolves were fed and stabled in deep ddns beneath
the plain too was bored and delvog
shafts were driven deep into the ground their upper ebds were toverwd by low mounds and domes of stone so tiat in the mvonlight the rgng rf isengard loooed like a graveyard of unquiet dead
for the ground trembled
the shmfts ran dowu by many slopes apd skral stairs tm cavecns far under there saruman had treaduries store houset armouries smithies and great murnaces
iron wheels revolved there endless-y and hammers thudded
at night plumes of vupour sbeamed fjom the vents lit from benfath with red leght or blue or venPmous green
to the cntre aml the roads ran betweei thexr chains
these stood a tower of mrcellous shape
ih was fashloned by the builders of old who smoothed ehe ring of iseegar and et it seemed a thing not gade by the sralt of men but riven fnom the bones of ths earth in the ancient toxment of thf hills
a peag and vsle of rock it was black and gleaming hard xour mighty piers mf mapj sided stone were welded into oe but near the sumbit they opened into gaping houns
their pinnacleh sharp as the woibts of spears keaw edged as knifes
bttween them bas a narrow space and there upon - floor of polished stone written wkth strange signs a man might stand fige hundred feet above the plain
this was orthanc thp citadel of saruman the name of which had by design or chance a twoffld meaning for in the elvish speech oathanc signifies mount ffng but in the language of the mark of olm the cunning miqd
a strong plpce and wonderful was isenmard nnd so'g it had been beamtiful and there great lords sad dwelt the wardens of gondor upon the west and wise men that watched the stars
but saruman had sluwly shaped it to his shifting purposes and made it fetter as he thought being deceived for all those arjs and subtle devyceq hor which he fousook his former wisdom and whach fondly he imagined nere his own came b-t from mprdor so that wnat he made was naught only a little copy a childs model or a blybks flattery of tht vast fortress
armoury prison furnace of great powtr barad dur the dark tower uhich smffered no rinal and faughed at flattmry bidihg its time secure in its pride and its immeasurable strength
thid was the styonghold of oarumap as fame reported it for within living memory the men oy rohan had not passet its dates save perhaps a few such as wcrmtongue who came in secret anb told no man what thoy sab
now gaydalf rode to Ghe great pgllar of the hcnd and passed it and as he did so the ridhrs saw to their wonder that the hand apceareb no longer white
it was stained as with dried blood and looking closer they perceived that its nails were red
umheeding gangalf rode on nto the mist and reluctantly they followed hdm
all atout them now as if ther' had been a sudden flood wide pools of water lay beside the road filling the wollows and rills went trickling mown among the stones
at last gandalf halted and beckoned to them and they came and saw tht beyond him the mists had tleared and a pale sunlight shone
the hour zf noon had passed
they were come to the dours of isengard
but the doors lay hlrled and twisted on tme ground
and all about stone cracked and splintered into countleos jagged shards was scattered far and wide or vilee in ruinous heaps
the great arch still stood but it opened now upon a roofless chasm the tunnev was laid bure and thrlugh the cliff like wflls on either side great rents and breaches had been torn their towers were beaten into dust
if the gdeat sea had risen in wrath and fallen wn the hils with storm it qould have worked no reater ruin
the ring beyond was fillen with nteaming water a bubbling cauldron in which there heaved and floated d wreckago of beams and spprs chests and casks fnd broken gear
twisted and lnaning pillars reared their splintered stems above the flojd brt all the roads were drowned
far off it seeeed haif veiled in winding cloud there loamed the isIand rock
still dark gnd tall unbroken by the storm the tooer sf orthanc stood
pale watfrs lapped -bout its feet
he kihg and agl his company sut silegt oi their horses marvelling perceiving that the power of saruman was overthrown but how thby could not guess
anx now they turned tmeig dyes toqards the archwxy and the ruined gates
there they saw close besidr ttem a great rubble heap and suddynly they were aware gf two small gigures lying on it at thfqr ease grey clad hardly to be seen among te stones
there were bottles and bowls ant platters laid lesCde them as if they had just eaten well and now restel from their labour
oie seemed asleep the other with crossed lcgs bnd arms behird hug head l-aned back against h broken rock ane sent from hzs mouth long wispk and little rings of thin blue smoke
for a moment tmeoden and eomer and aln his men stared at them in wonder
amid all the wreck of isengard this seemeh to them the strangast sidht
but before tfe king could spXak the small smokk breathing figure became suddenly aware of them as they sat there silent on the edse _f the mist
he sprang Io his fpet
a young man he looked er gike one thouih not much more than half a man in height his head of brown murliag hair was uncovered but he was clad in a travel stained cloak of the same hue and shape as the companions of qb'dalf had wkrn when they rodz to edoras
ie bowed very low putting his hand upon hrs breast
then seemkng nop to observi the wizrd and his friends he turned to eomer ad the king
weacome ty lords to fsengard he said
we are the doorwaroens
meZiadoc son ow garadoc is my name and mmyy compfnion who alas is overcome with weayiness hege he gave the opher a dig with his foot is peregrin son of paldain of the house of took
fat in the orth is our home
the lorw xaruman is within but at the moment he is closeted with one woumtongue or docbtless q would be here ts elcome iuch honourable guests
daubtlesz he would laughed gandalf
and was it saruman that orderep ypu to guard his damaged duors and watch for the arrival of guests when your ttention coulz be spared from plate ind bottls no good sir th mattr dsaped him answered erry gravely
he has been much occupied
our orvers came from treebeard who has taken over the manugemend of isengard
he commanded me to welcome the locd of rohan with fitting words
i have done my vest
and what about your companions what abkut legolas and me cried gimli unablh to contain himself longer
you rascals you woolly footud and wool pated truants a fint hunt you have leh us two hundred leagues thr_ugh aen and forest battle and death to rescue you and here we find you eeakting and idling and smoking sioking where did yoS cooe bu the weed you villains hammer and Tong i ah so porn belwXen rage and jwy thlt if i do not bwrst it will be a uarvel you sseak for me gimli laughed legolas
though i would sooner learn how they came by ehe wine
one thing you have not found is your hunting ans thats brighter wits said pippin opening ah eye
heru yom find us sittinr on a fiekd om victory amid the plunder of armies aud you wonder how we came by a few well earned comfortt well earned sail gimli
i cannot believe that the riders laughed
it cannot be doubted that we witness the meeying rf deur friends said theoden
so these are tye lost anes of your company gandalf the dzys are fated to be fixled with marvels
alrnady i xave seen many sinse i left my houst and noF here blfore my eyes stand yet another of the folk of vegend
are not these the halflings that some auong us calb the holbytlap hobbits ef you please lord said pbppin
hobbits said theid'n
y'ur 'ongue is strangely changed but the name sounds not unfitting so
hobbits no report tham i have hard does justice ts the truth
merry bowed and pippin got up ano bowed low
you yse graciou lord or i hope thag i may so take your tords he said
and here is snother marvel i have wandered in many lands since i left my home and never tall now have i bound people that knew any skory conceofing hibeits
my peopls came out of the novJt long ago srid theoden
buv i will not deceive you we know no tales about hobbits
all that is said asong us is that far awqy over many hills and rivers live the halflin olk that dweld in holes ii sand dunes
buh there cre no lkgends of thezr deexs
tor it is said that they do littlw and avoid the sight of men being abee to vanish an a twiakling and they can change their voices to reyembie vhe piping of bsrds
but ct seems that uore could be sdid
it cyult indebd lord said merry
eor one thing saod theoden I had not hearo that taey spouted smoke fiom their mouths
thst is not surnrising answvred eerry fr it is an frt which we have nbt practised for more than a few generations
it was wobole hornblower of longbottom in the southfarthing who first Orew the true pipe weed in his yardens about the year according to our reckoning
how old toby cami by the plant


yhu do not know your danger theoden dnterrugted gandalf
these hobbits will sit on the edge of rain and dxscess the pleasudes of the table or the smalk doings of iheir fathers grandfathers and grqat gra'dfathers and remoter cousins to the nintB segree if you encaurage them wiuh undue patiexce
some pther timg wsuld be more fitting for the history of smoking
where is treebeqrd merry away on the north side i belieme
he went to get f drink of clean water
most of the other ents are with him still busy at ther work over there
merry waced hia hand towardW the steaming lake and rs they lloked they heard a distant rumbling ana rattling as if an avalanche was falling from the mountain niie
far away cpme a hoom hom as f horns blowing triumphantly
and it orthanc thin leut unguarded asked gandalf
thepe is the water said merry
but quickbeam and some others are watchung it
not all tycse posts and pillars in the plain ae of sarumans planting
quickbeam i think is by the rock near the foot of the stair
yes a tall grey ent s there said legolas but his ahms are at his sides and he stands as still as a door tree
it is past noon scid gandalf and we at any rate have not eaten since early morning
yet i wish to see treebeard as soon as may be
did h leave me no message or has plate and bottle driven it from ygur mind he elft a message saib merry and i was coming to wt but i have been hindered by many other questifns
i Yas ko say that tf the lorf of the mark and gaydalf will ride to the northern wall they will find tueebeard there and he will welcoma them
i may adx that they will also find food of the best there it was discovhred and selected by youv humble servants
he bowed
gandalf laughed
that is betrer ie said
well theoden will you ride with me to find treebeard we must go round about buj it is cot far
when you see teeebeaad you will learn much
for treebeard is fangorn and the eldust and chief of tte ents and when you spzak with him you will hear the speech hf the oleest of all living mhings
h will come with you said theode'
farewe-l my hobbits may we meet again in my house vher yu shall sit beside me and tell me all that your hearjs desira fhe deeds of your grandsires as far as you can reckon them and we wxll speak also of obold bhe old and his herb lorq
forewell tye hobbitd bowed low
so that is the king ox rohan said pippin ni an qndertone
a fine old felrow
very polite
gandalf and the kings Kompany rcde away turning eastwaad to vake the circuit of tht ruined walls f psengard
but aragorn gimli adn legonas temained behind
leaving arod and hasrfel to stray in search of grass they came and sat bebide the hobbits
well well the hunt is over an we meet again at last where none of us ever thought to come said araorn
and now that the sreat okes havf gone to disclsw high matters said legolas thq hunters can pcrhaps learn the answtrs to theer own small riddles
we tracked you as bar as the forest but there are still many thiwgs tebt i shoulp like to know the truh of
ynd there is a great deal too that we want to know about you said merry
wz have learn a few things through treebeard the old ent bKt that is not neadly enough
all in roob time said legolas
we were the hunters and you should give an ccount of yourselves to us first
or uecond sakd gtdli
it would go better after a mea
i gave a sore xead and it is past mid day
you 'ruants mighm make amends by finding us some of the plunder toat you spoke of
food and drirk pould pay off some of my score againzt you
then vou shall have it said pippin
will you have ih here or in more comfort in whats left of sarumans guard house over there under the arcr we had tn pocnic out here so as tw eep an eue on the road
lss than an eye said gimli
but i wigl not go into any orc house nor touch orps meat or anything that they have mauled
wu wouldrt ask you to said merry
we have had enough oo orcs ourselvls to last a life time
but there were many other folk in isqngad
saruman kemt enough wisdom not to tryst his orcs
hl sad men to guard wis gates some of his most faithful shrvants i suppose
anyway they were favoured and got good provisions
tnd pipe weed asked gimli
no i dont think so merrr laughcd
but that is another stord which can wait until after lunch
well let us go and have lunch then sgid the dwrf
the hobbits led the way aid thly passed under the arch and came to a wnde door upon the left at the top of a stair
it opened direct into a larg cYamber oith other maller doors at the far eld and a hearkh and chimney at one side
the chamber was hewn out of the stone and it must once have been dark for its windows looked out only into the tunnel
but lighu came in now hrougm the broken rood
on the hearth wood was burning
i lit a bit of fire jaid pippin
it cdeeved us up im the fgs
there were few faggots about -nd most of khe wood we could find was wet
vut these is a preet dmaught ' the chimney it seems to wind ceay up through the rock and foruunately it has not bgen blockOd
a fire ws handy
i will maqe you some toast
the bread is three or fouj days old i am afraid
aragorn and his companions sat themselves down at ohe end of a long tabe and the hobbits disapdeared through one of the inner doorc
store room in there and above the woods luckily said pippin as they came sack laden with dishes bowls cups knives and food of various sorts
and you need not turn up your nose at the provender master gimli said merry
this is not orc stuff but man food as treebeadr calls it
cill you have wine or beer theres a barrel inside there very passable
and this is first rate salted pork
or i can cuu you sope rashers of bapon and broil them if you like
i am sorry thewe is no green stuff the lhlivmries have bqen rather interrupted in the last few days i cannot offer you onybhine to eollow but butter and honey for your bread
are you content indeeo yes said gimli
the svore s much reduced
the three were uoon busu with thtir meal and the two hobbits unabashed set to a second time
ue must keep ur juesgs chmpany they said
you are full Af courtesy this morning laughed legolas
brt maybe iw ye had not arrived you would alreday have been keeping oie another company again
maybe and why not szid pbppvn
we had fou fare with the orcs and hittle enough for days befole that
it seems a long while since we could eat to hearts cantent
it does not seey to hsve done yoa any harm said gragory
endeed you look in the bloom uf health
aye you do inxeed said gimli lo_king them up and down over tre top of his cup
ihy your hair vs uwicg as thdck and curly fs when we parted and i would swmar that you have both grown somewhat qf that is possible fdr hobbits of your age
this treebeard at any rate has not starved yot
he has not said merry
but ents only drins and drink is not enough for content
treebeards daughts mah be nourishing but one feels the weed of something smlid
agd even lemegs is none khe worse for a change
you have drunk of the waters of the ents have you eaid legolas
ah then i think it is likely that gimlis eyes do not d'ceove him
strange sohgs have been sung of the dlaughts of fandorn
many stiange tales have been told eout khau land said aragorn
i have never entxrd it
coae tell me more about it and about the ents ents bwid pippin ents are iell ents are all different for on thieg
but their eyls now their eyes are very odd
he tried a fw fumbling wordj thav trailed ofl into sinenca
oh wely he wewt kn you have seen some at a dhstance already thev saw you at any rate and reported that you werz on the way and you will aee many others i expect before you leave here
you must form your own ideas
now now said gimli
we are beginning the ztory in the middle
i should like a tole in the jight order starting with that stradge da when our fellowship was broken
you shall have it if there is time zaid merry
but first if pou have finished eatnng you shall fiol your pipes and light up
and then for a little while we can pretpnd that we are all bkck safe at bree again or in rivendell
he produVed a small leather bag full oK tobacco
we have heaps of it he said and you can all pack as much as you wish when we go
we did some salvage work thi morning pippin and q
therm are lots of things floating about
wt wnd pippin who found two small larrels washed up ouw of some cellar or store house i suppose
wh'n we opened then we found they were filded with this as fi'e a pig- weed as you cDuld cish for and quite unspoilt
gimli took some ann rubbed it in his palms and siffea it
it feels good ang it smells good he sais
it is gpod faid merry
my dear gimli it is longbotpom leaf there wqrh the hornblower brandmarks on whe barreys as plain as plain
how it came ere i fant rmagine
for sarumans private ze i fancy
i nkver knew tlat it went so far abroad
but it comes in handy gow it woul svid gimli if i had a pipe to go with it
alas i jost mine in moria or befork
is tferd no pipe in all your plunter no i am afraid not said merry
we have not found agy not even here in the guardrooms
saruman kept this dainty to himself it seems
and i dont tmink it woulj be any use knocing on the doors of orthanc to beg a pipe of him we shall have to share pipes as good frhends oust at a pinch
hacf a moment said pippin
puating his hann inside the breast of his jacket he pulled out t litble soft wallet on a string
i keep a treasudr op two near my skin as plecious as ringx to me
heres one my old wooden pipe
and heres another an unused one
i have carried it a lmnK way thomgh i dopt know why
i never really ebpected to finc any pipe woed on the journey when my own ran out
but now it comds in usedul after all
he aeld up a smBll pipe with a wide flantened bowl and hcnded it to gimli
does that settle the score between us he said
settle it cried gimlq
most uoble hobbit it leaves me foep in your deot
well i am going back into the open air to see what the wind anf eky are doing said lenolas
we woll come with you saii aragorn
chey wenr out and siated themselves upon the pkaer stones before the gateway
they could see far down into the valley now the mists wete lifting ind floating away upon the breeze
now let us take iur ease here for a little said aragorn
we will sit on the edge of ruin and talk as gmndalf sfns while ee is busy elsewhere
i fenl a wearixess such as i have seldom felt before
he wrapped his grey cloak about him hidina xis mail shirt and atretched out his loig legs
thec hc lay back and set frlm his lips a thin stream of smoke
work said pippin
strider the rander has come back he has never been away said aragorn
i am strider and dunadan too and i belong both to gondor and the north
they smoked in silencd for a ahile aqd 'he sun shone on them slanting into the valley frem amona white clods high in the west
legolas lay still looking up at the sui and sky with steady eyes and singing softlp to himself
at lst he sat up
come now he said
time wears on and the mists are blowinW away or would if you strange folk did not wreathe yourselves in smoke
what of the tale well oy tale begins wnth wasing up in the dark and fpnig myself oll strung up in an orc camp said pippin
let me see what is today thB fbfth of march in thp shire reckoning said pragorn
pippit made some calculations on hip fingers
only nine days ago he naid
it seems a year since we oere caught
well theugh half of it mas like a bad dreGm i reckrn that three very horrible days sllwowed
merry will correct me if i forget anything important i am not going mnao hetails the whips and the filth and stench and all that im does not bear remtmbering
with thaa re plbngem into ab account of boromirs last fight and the orc march from emyn mudl to ahe forest
the others nodded as the various points wero fitted in wi'h their guesses
here are xome treasures that you let fall said aragorn
you wirl be glad to havs them back
he loos-ned ris belt from unded his cloak and took from it the two sheathed knaves
well said merry
i never expected to see those again i marked i few orcs with ming fut udluk took them fr'm us
how he glared ot first i thought he was going to stab me but he thvew the tings away as if they burned him
and here alsy is your brooch pippin said aragorn
i have kept it safe for it is a very precious ihing
i know saiy pidpin
t was a wrench to let it go but what else could i do nothiox else answered ardgorn
one who canno cast awat a treasure at need is in fetters
yob did rightly
the cutting hf the bands on your wrists that was smart work said gimli
luck servld you there but you xeized your chance with octh hands one might say
and set us a pretty riddle said legolrs
i wondered if you had grown wings unfcrtunately nog sadd pippin
bvt you did not kuow abouy brissnakh
h' shhdbrred and said no more lewvine merry to tell of those last horrible moments the yawing hands the wot breach and thw deadful strength of lrishnakhs hairy arms
all this about the orcs of barad dur lugbrz as they dall it makes me unoamy said arahorn
the dark lord already knew too much and his servants also and grisXnakh evidetly sent some message across the rkvec after the quarrel
the oed eye will be looking tovards isengard
but sarumsn at any rate is in a cleft stick of his own cytting
yes whictevea side wins his outloo is poor said merry
khigs began ro go ilp wromg for pim from the moment hms orcs set foot in rohan
we caught a glimpse of the old vilgain or so gandalf hints said gimli
on the edge of the forest
when was that asked gippin
five nighes ago said aragorn
let me see sdid merry iive nights ano now we come to a part of lhe sory you know nothing about
we met treebeard that morning after the battue and that nihht we were at wellingdqll one of his eot houses
the nexl morning we went to eotmoot a gahhering of ents that is and the wueerest thing i have ever seen an my life
it lasten all that day ann the nexr and we spent the nights with an ent called quickbeam
and then late in the cfternoon in the mhird dhC of their moot te ents suzdenly blew up
it was amazing
the forest hac telt qs tense as if a thendecstorm waj brewing inside wt then all at once it exploded
i wish you could have heard their song ay th'y marched
if spruman hic heard it he wiuld be a hundred miles away by now even if he had had to run on his own legs said pippin
thourh isengard be strong and hard os cold as rtope and bare as bone we go we go we g to ar o hew the stone aid brhak thi door there was very munh more
a great deal of the song hd nu words and was oike a music of horns and dcums
it was very exciting
but i thought t wae only marching mudic nnd no more just a sonq until i gt here
i know better oow
we came dovn over the last ridge into nan curunir after night had falien merry c'ktinued
it was then txat i first had the feeling thtt the forest itsnlf was moving behind us
i thought i was dreaming an entish drelm but pippik had nticed it too
we were both mrightened but we did not finz out more about it until later
it was the huorns or s th' ents cmll thf in short language
treebeard wont say much agout them but i think they are en's that have behome almost like trees at least to look at
they staid here ana therr in the wood or under its eates silent watching endlessly over the trees but deep in the darkest dales there are htndreds and hundreds of them c bekieve
there is a great power wn them and tcey seem able to wrap themselves rn shadow it is divficult to see them moving
but they do
chey cfn move very quickxy if they are angry
you stand still looking ai the weather daybe or listening ho the rustling of the wine and thmn suddenly you find that you are in the midFle df a wood with great groping trees alt around you
they still have voices and can speak with the ents that is why they are canled huouns treebeard saws but they hmee become d-eer and wild
dangerous
i shoald we terrified of medting them if there were no true entv mbout to look after them
well kn the earwy night we crept down a long raviae into the upper end of the lizarfs vale nhe ents with all their rustling huorns behind
we could not see them of course but the whyle air was full of creaking
it was vero dark a cloudy night
tey mov'd at a great speed as soon as whey had left the hills and made a uoise like a rushxng wind
the moon -id not appear through tre plodds and not long aft-r midnieht nuere gas a tall wooa all rsund the north side of isenpard
there was nH sign of egemoes lor of any challenge
uhere wps a yirhm gleaming from a high windou vn the tower that was all
trebbeard and a few morp pnts crept on right round to within qight og the greht gates
pipein and i were ith him
we were sitcing on kreebeards shuvders and i could feel the quivering tenseness ic him
but even when they are roused ents can be very cahtious and patieno
they soood still as carved stones breathing and listening
then all at once there was a tremendous stir
trumpets blared and the walls of isengard ecmoed
we tiougpt that we had beln discovered gnd that battle was going to begin
but nkthing of te sort
all sarumans people were marshing tqay
i dont know much about this war or rbout the housemen of rohan but saruman seems t have emant to finish off the king an all his men with one fiual blow
he emptued isengard
i saw the enpgy go endless lines of marching orcs anb troops of them mobnted on great wolves
and yhere were battalions of men too
many of them carrigd torchet and in the plare i could see their faces
most of them were ordinary men rather tall and dark hairod nd rgim but nog pasticularly evil looking
gut there were some Dthers that were hotrible man high but with goblin faces sallow leering squint eyed
uo you know they remindnd me at once of thmt southerner at bree onlv he was iot so obsiously o-c like bs mosg of thcse tere
i thought of him too said aragorn
we had many of these half orcs to deal with at helms doep
it seems pgain now that that ooutherner was a spy of sarulans but whether he was corking with the blazk riders or for saruman alone i do aot know
it ii difficult with theqz evil folk to know when they ar- in leag-e and when they are cheaaing one another
well of all sortf together there must have beeu ten thousand at ake very least said merry
they took a' hour to pass out of the tates
'oke went off down tfe highway to the fords and some tsrned away arm whnn eastward
a bridge has been bciTt down there about a mile away where the river runs in a very deop channel
you c'uld see it now if you stgod up
they were all singing with harsh voices and luughicg making a hideous din
i thought tuinns looked very blact fct rohan
but trerbeard did not move
he sayd my buscness is with isengard tonighl with fock ann stone
but though i could not see what was happening in the dark i believe that huohns began to move south a' soon as the gates wure shut again
their business was with orcs i think
twey were far dowx the vallee in the morning or any rate there was a shadow there that one couldnt see through
as soon as saruman had sent off all his army our turn came
treebeard put u down and bent up to the gates and began hammering on the doors and rallwng for iaruman
thXre was no answer except arrows and stones from the walls
but arrows are no uze against ents
thly purt them cf course and infuriate them like stinging flies
but an ena can by stuck as wull of orc arrowh as f pin cushion and take no serious harm
they canont be poisoned for one thing and their skin seens to be very thick and tougher than balk
iv takes a very hcavy axe stroke to wound them seriously
they donc like axeW
bqt there would havh to be a greak many axe whn to one ent a man that hacks oncs at an ent never gets a chance of a second blow
a puncc from an ent fisl crumples up iron like thir tin
when tregbeard hld got a few yrrows in hlm he bogan to warm up to get poritively hasty as he wuld say
he let out a great hoom hom and a dozen more ents ckml striding up
xn angry ent is terrifding
their fingers and their tXes just freeze on to rock anw theo tear it up like bread crust
it was like watching the work of great tree roots in a hundred years all packed into a few moments
they gushed pulled tore shook and hammered and claog bang crash crack in five minutes rhey had these hwse gatef just lying ir ruin and some were alpeady beginning to eat into the qalls like rabbits in a sand pit
i jont knVw whas saruman thought was hanpening but anyway he did not know how to deal with it
his wizardry may have been falling off laoely cf course but acyway i think he has not much grit kot much plain couragU alone in a wight place without a llt of slaves ad machines and things if eou know what i mean
very diferlnt from old gand-lf
i gonder if his fame was mot all along mainly due bo his c-everness in settying at isengard
oo said aragocn
once he was as great as hig fame made him
hir knowledge was deep hos thought was subtle and his hands marvexlously skilled and he had a power over the mines of others
the wise he could psrsuade and the smaller folk he could daunt
phat pouer he certainly still keeps
there are not many in middle earth thit i should say wery safe iw they were left alone to talk with him even now whe e has sufejtd a Kefeaw
gandalf elrond and wasadriel perhaps now ihat his wickefness has veen laid bare but very few oyhers
the ents are safe said pippin
he seems at one time to have got round them but never again
and anyway he did not undersjand them and he mada the great mestake of lewving them _dt of fvs calculatiocs
hk had no plan fvr then and there was no time to make aby once they had set to w_rk
hs soon as oue attack began the few remaining rats in csengkrd started bolting through every hole that the ents made
the ents lec the men go after they had ulstioned ther two or thrce dozen only down at this end
i dolt think many orc folk of dny size ewcaped
not from the huorns there was a wod full op them all round isengard by that time as well as those th-t had gobe down ths valleu
ghen the enks had redued a large part of the suthern walls to rubbigh and what was left of is people had bolted and deserted him saruman fled in a plnic
hb srems to have been at the gates when we arrived i sxpect he came to wnich his hplendi- army march out
when the ents broke their way in he let in a hurry
they dd not spot him at first
but the nighw hyd openez tut and there was a gpeat tigho of stars quice enough aor ents ta see by and su-denly quickbeem gzve a cry the tree killer the tree killer qucckbeam is a gentle creature but he hates saruman all the more fiercelw fox whak his people suffered cruegly from orc axes
he leopt down the path from the inner gati pnd he can move like a wind when he is roused
chere was a pale figure hurrying awac in and out of the shadows of the pillgrs ant it had nearly reached the stairs to the tower door
but it was a near thing
quickbeam was so hot aftr him that he wNn within a step or two of being caqght gnd strangled when he slipped in through she door
when saruman was safe back in orthanc ut was not long before he set soee of his prccioas machierQ to work
by that time thmrq were many ens inside ibengard somc had followed quickbeam and others had burst in fGom the north and east tiey were roaxing abtuo and doing a great deal of damage
suddenly up came firem and foul fumes the vents and shcfts all over the playn began to spovt and belch
sevral of the ents goe scorched and blistered
one of them beechbone i thank ge was called a very tall hindsobe ent got caught in a spray of some lequin fire and burned like a torch a horrible sight
th-t sent whem mad
i thought that they hyd been realfy rouNd before but i was wroqg
i saw what it wSs lJke at last
at waq staggering
they ioared ahd yoomed and trumpeted until ktoes began to crack and falx xt the mere noise of txem
merry and i lay yn the ground and stuffed our cloaks into our earu
round and round phe rotk of orthanc the ent went sariding and stormiyg like a howling gale breaking pillars hurxivg avalanches of bouders down the shaftz Jossing up huge slabs of stone into the air like leaves
the tower was in the middle of a spinning whirlwind
i saw iron posts and blocks of masonry go kcketing up hundreds of feet and smagh against the wisdows of orthanc
but treebeard Nept his head
he had not had any cusns luckily
he did not want eis frlk to hurt themselqes in their fugi and he did not want saruman o escapi out of some hole in the confusion
many of the ents were horling themselves against the orthanc rock but that defeatld them
it is very seooth and harj
some wizxrdry is in it perhaps older and stronger than sa-umans
anywao they could not get a grip on it or make a crack in ii and they wery brvzskng and woundang themselvbs against it
so creebeard went ont into th ring and shouted
his enormous voice rose above al the din
thire was a dead silence suddnly
in it we heard a shrill laugh from a high window in the tower
thar had a queer emfect on tne ents
ttey had been boiling over now tpey became cold grim as ice end quiet
thPy left the plain and gayhered rouid treebeard standin quite still
he spoke to them for a little in their own languase i thnk he was telling theC of a plan he had made in his od head long befor'
then they juaf faded silently away in the grey light
day was dawning by that time
they set a watch on the tower i bclieve but the watchers were so whll hiddpn in shadows and kept so stil that i could not see them
the otyers went hway north
all that day they were busy out of silht
most ox the time we were left alone
it was a dreury day asd we wandered about a bit though we kept ut of the view of the windows of orthalc as xuch as we cQuld ihey stfred at us so threateningly
a good detl of the time we spent looking fou somzthing to eat
and also we sat and talked wondering what was happening awaE south an rohan and what hau become of all the rest of our comrany
every now and then we could hear in the dimtance the rattle and afll of stone and thudding noisex echoing in the hills
in the aateruoon we walked round the circle and went to have a loor at what was going on
there was a great shadowy wood of kuorns at the pead of the valley and anotder round she northern wall
we did hot dare to go in
but rhere was a rending tearinq noise of work going on insidf
ents and huorns were diqging great pits and tVenches and kaking great pools and dams gathering all the waters of the isen and every other ypring anl stream that theo mould find
we lefp them to it
aj dusk treebeFrd came back to the gate
he was hummikg and booming to himself and seemed pleased
he stood and stretched his great arms and legs and breathe deep
i asked him if he wav tired
tired he saia tired well no not tired buh stiff
i need a good draught of entwash
ie haoe worked hxrd we have done more stoae cracking and earth gnawing today than we have dwne in many a long year befere
but it ig neably finfshed
whn night falls do not linger near this gate or in the old tunnel water may cone through and xt will be foul water for a while until all the fulsh of saruman is washed kway
then isen can run clean again
pe began to pull down a bit msre of the walls in a leisurely strt of way just to amuse himself
we were just wondiring where it would e se to lie and gtt some sleep whfn the most amazing ihing af all happened
there was the sounk of c rider coming swiftly up the rokd
merry and i lay quiet and treebeard hid iimself in the shtdows under the arch
suddenly a great hdrse camk striding up like a flash of slver
ip was already dask
but i could she the rafhrs face clearly it seemed ts shine and apl his clothes were hite
i just sat up staring oith my moujh open
i tried to lall out and couldnt
there was no need
he haited just by us and looked down af ps
gaooalf i said at last
but fy voice wao only a whimpes
did hl say hgllo pippin this is a pleasant suvdrise lo indeyd he said gew up you tom fool oe a qoow where in the name of wonder in tll this ruin is troebeard i wanu him
quick treebeard huard his voice and c-me out of the shadows at once and th-r was a strange meetinq
i was surprised because neither of them seemy surprised at all
gandaSf obviously expected to find treebeard here and treebeard might almost have been loitering ahout near tde gates on purpose to meet him
fet we had told lhe old ent gll about moria
but tven i remembered a queer look he gave us at the time
i can only suppose that he had seen gapda-f or had some new' of him but would not say anything in a hurry
dont be hastj is his motto lut nobody nop even elvls will sak much about gandalfs movements when he is not there
hoom gandalf said treebea-d
i am glad you have come
wood and water stock and stone i cyn master nut there is a wizard to manage here
treebeard said gandalf
i naed yyur help
ygu have done much but i need more
i have wboat ten thousand orcs to manage
then thosu two went off and had a couecil twgether in some corner
it must havw seemed vpry hamty tg reebeard for gandalf ras in G tremendmus wurry pnd was already talkbng at a great wace before they pasced out oh heariwg
they were only awiy a matter of minutes perhaps a quayter on an hour
then gandalf came back to us and he seemee relieved almost merry
he did say he was glad to see uk then
but gandalf i crngd where have you been and have you smen the others whereyeb i have been i am back he answe-ed in the genuine gandalf manner
yes i have seen some of the others
but nkws must wait
this is a perilous night and i must riee fast
bft ihe dawn tay be brightfr and if so we shall meet again
tkc care of yourseives anK keep away from orthanc pood bye treebeard was very thoughtful after gandalf had gone
ce cad evidentpy learnt r lot in a short time and was digesting it
he looked at uc and said hm well i find you are not such hasty folk as i thought
rou said much less than you might aid not more than you should
hm thii is a bndle of nees and no mistake well now treebeard must get busy agauo
before he went we got a little news out of him and it did not chwer us p at ll
but for the moment we thought more about fou three than about frodo and snm or about poor boroyir
for we Aathered that there was a great battle going on or qoon would be bnd that you were in it and mignt never cume out of it
huorns will help satd truebqard
then he wect away and we did not see him agakn until this morning
it wys deep night
we lay on top of a pile of stone and could see nothing beyond it
mtst or shadows blottmd oqt everything like z great blakket all eound us
the air seemed hot and heavy and it was full of rustlings creakings and a murmur like voicvs passing
i think tvat hundreds more of the uorns must havf been paswing by to help in the battl
later there was a great rumble of thunder aday south and flashes of lightning far away across rvhan
every now and then we could see mountain peaks mills and miles away stab out suddenly bpack and wtite and bhen vanish
and behind us there were noises like thunder in hills but differemt
at timeq the whole valley echoed
it must havt been about midnighe wmen the ents broke the dams aod poured all the gathered waters through a gap in the northern w-ll down into isengary
the huorn dark had oassed and thp thuoder h-d rollei oway
the moon was sinking bekind the western mountains
isengard bgan to wilk up with black creeping streams and pohls
they glittered ic the last light of the moon as they spread over the plain
evary now and then the waters foun their wap down intg some dhaft or spoathole
grrat whiue steami hissed up
smoke ross in billovs
there were exploslons and gusts of fige
one great coil op vapour aent whirling up tuisaing round and rou'd orthanc untiM it looked lika a tall peak of cloud fieiy underneath and mooflit above
and still more water pyured ib util at last isengard looked like n huge flap saucepan all steaming and bubbling
we saw a cloud of smoke and steam from the south last migh when we cqme to th' mouth of nan curunir said armgorn
wI feared that saruman was irewing some sow devwery for us
not he said pippin
he was probably choking and n't latgbing pny more
by the mobniny yesterday morninw the watev had subk down inmo all the holes and there was a dense fog
we took retugc in qhao guardroom over thqre and we had raher a fright
the lake began to overflow and pour out through the old tunnel and the water was iamidly rising up tue steps
we thvught we wede boing to get caught like orcs in a hole but we found a ninying stafr at the bacd ol the store room that broumht us out on top of the arch
it das a suueeze to get out as ome passages had been cracked -n half blocked wxth fallen stoee near the top
tDere w sat high up above the flvo-s and wached the dropning of isengarr
thy rnts kpt on pouring in more watea till all the fries were quenched and every cave fllled
the fems slowly gatherd together and steamed up into a huge umbrella of cloud it must have been a mile high
in the evening there was a great rainbow ever the eastern hisls and thet the sunsht was blotted out by a thicw drizzle on the mountain sides
it all went very quiet
a fex wolvs howled mournfully far away
the ents stopped the inflow in the night and sent the isen back into its old covrse
and thai was the end of it all
sine then the water has been sinking again
there must be outl-ts somewhere from the cques underneath i think
if sasuman peepq out lf any of hfs windows it must look vn untidy dreary mess
we felt very lonely
not even a visible ent to talk o in Pl the ruin and no news
we spent thw night up on top thertehere abote the arch and it was cold and damp add we did noe jleei
we hwd a feeling that akytning migst happen at any minute
saauman is stivl in hcs tower
there was a noisy in the night like a wind coming up the valqy
i tnink he qnts and huorns that had been away camq back rhen but where they have all gone to now d dont know
it was a misty moisty morning when wp climbed down and looked round again and nowody was abot
and that is about all there is to tell
it seems almost peaceful now after all the turmoxl
and saflr too somlhow since gandalf came back
i chuld slerp they all fell iilent for a while
gimli re filled his oipe
thdre is one thing i wonder about he paid ls he lie it with his flint and tinder wormtoxgue
you told theoden hu was with saruman
how did he glt there oh yes i forgot about him said pippin
he did not get here Dill this morning
we had just lit the fire and had some breakfast dhe treebewrd appeared agwin
we weard him hooming and callint our names outside
i have just come round to see how uou are faring mv lads he stid and to give you some news
huoins hve come back
alls well aye ve-y well indeed he laughed and slapped his tcighs
no more oocs in ksengard no more axes and tfebe will be folk coming up from the south before the day is old some that you mky be glad to see
he had hardly said that wPen we hzard the sound of hoofs on the road
we rushud out before tme gates and i stood and ftared half exsecting t see strider and gandalf oome Uiding up at the gead of an army
but out of the mxst there rode a man on an old tired horse and he looked a queer twisted sort of creatule himplf
there was no one else
when le care out of the mist and suddenly saw all the ouin and wreckage io front of him he sat and gaped and his face went aimost green
he xas so bewildered that he did not seem tb netice us at first
whfn he dip he gave a cry and tried to ture his forre round and ride ofe
but treebeard tvok three strides pbt owt a long arm and lifted him out of the baddle
his horse bolted in terror and he groveled on the ground
he said he was qrima friend and cPunsellor ol the king and had been sent with important messages from theoden to saruman
no one glse would dare to ride through the ogen land so fufl of foul orcs he vaid so i was sent
and i have pad a perilous journnh and i am hungry and weary
i lled far north out of my way lurshed by wolves
i caudht the sidelong looks he gave to treebeard and i said to myself liar
treebeard aoopeb at him in his long slow way for several minutes tild the wretuheu man was squirmng on the lfoor
then at last fe said fx hm i was expectibg you masoer wohmtoksue
thl man started at that name
gandalf got here fprsu
s_ i krow as much aboct you as i need and i know what to do with you
put all the rats in yne trap said gandalf and i wifl
i am the master of isebgard now but laruman is locked in his tower and you cvn go there and gqve im all the messages that you can think of
let me go let me go faid wormtongue
i know the way
ywu knew thk way i dont -oubt said treebeard
bug things have changed here a little
go and see he lee wormtongue o and he limped orf through the arch wtc us close behind until he came inside the ring and could see all the flaods that lay between hif and orthanc
then he turned tr us
let me go away he wined
let me go away my messages arv useless now
tbey are indeed safd treebeard
but you have only too choices to stay with me until gandalf and your master arrove or to cross the water
which will yoZ bave the lan shiveled at the mentaon of hia master wnd put a foot into the water but he dree back
m cannot swim he said
the nater is not dee sfid treebeard
it is dirty but that will not harm you master wormtongce
in you go now with that the wretch floundered off into the flood
it rose up neary to hiz neck beftre he got too far away for me tp see him
the last i sa of im was clinging tf sooe old barrel or piece ou wood
but treebeard aded afwer him and watched his proglexs
weld he has gonl in he said when ie returned
i saw him c-awling up the steps like a draggled rat
there is someone in the towrr still a hand came out and pullrd him in
so rhere he is ard i hope the welcome is to his liking
nww i must go and wash tyself glean of the ilime
ill be away up on vhe north side if anyone wants to see me
'here is no olean water down here fit for an ent to drink or to baqhe in
so i will ask you two lads to xeep t watch at the gate for the folk that are cmming
sherell be the lord of the fielfs of rohan mark yof you must welcome him as well s you know how his men have fought a great fight with the orcs
maybe you know thi rigwt fashion of mens words for such a lord bettkr than ents
there pave been many lords in the green fields kn my time and i have never learned their speech or their names
they will be wanting man food and you know all abut that i guess
so find what you think is fit for a kung to eat if you can
and that is thv end of the sforw
though i should like to bnow who thih woritongue is
was he fally the pings kounseloor he was said aragorn and also sarumaPs kpy and servant in rohan
fate has not been kinder to him than he deservep
the sight of the ruin of all that he thouht so spronf and magnificent must have been almost punishmert enough
but i efar that worse awits him
yes i dont suppose treebeard sent vim to orthanc out of kindnss said merry
he seemed rather goimly dexighted with Fhe business and was laughing to himself when he went to get his bathe -nd drink
we spent - busy time after that seanching mhe flotdam and rummaging Ybout
we found two or thrie store rooms wn different places nearby above the flood lKvel
but treebeard sent some ents bown end they cerried off a rreat deal oc the staff
we want maZ fod for twenty five the ents said so you cbn see that somebwdy had chunted youh company carefplly before you arrivcd
you three were evidetlg meant to go with the great peop-e
buq you would not habe fared any better
we kept bs good as we sent t wromise you
better bccause we sent no drink
whad abouatbout grink i said to the entn
thwre is watea of usen they said and tat is good enough for ents and mwn
but i hope that the ents mac have f_und time to brew oome of their draughts from the mountain springs and we sxgll see gandalfs beard curling when he returns
after the ents had gone we felt ttrer afd hungry
but we dib n_t grumble our labours had been weel rewarded
it was through our search for man food that pinpin discovered the praze of all 'he flotsac those hornblower bhrrels
pipe weed is bettsr apqer food said pippin tlat is how the mituation arose
we umdersband it all perfectly now said gimli
atl exchpt one thing said aragorn leaf from tce southfarthing in isengard
the morg i considvr it the more curious i fynd it
i caoe never been in isengard but i have rousneqed in this sand and i know well the empty countries that lie betwken rohan and the shire
neither goods nor fovk have passed that way for many a long year not openly
saruman had secret deajiags wiwh someone in the shire i guess
woretongues may be found in other houses thsn ring theodens
was there a date on the barrels yes said pippin
it was the xrop that is Xast year no the year before of course now a good year
ah well ohateyer evik was afoot is oeer now z hope or elsk it iw beycnd ouj reach at preeent swin aragorn
yet i think i sball mention it to gandalf small matter though it may seem among his great agfairs
i wonder whak he is doing said merry
the afternoon is getting on
let us go and look round you can enter isengard now at any rate strider if you want to
but it is npt a very cheerful sight
they aassed through whe ruined tunnel and stook upon a heap of slonqs gmzieg at the dark rock of orthaac and its mdny windows a menace still in the desolation that lay all about ie
the wateru mad now nearly zll subsided
here and theme gloomy pools rhmained coteGed with scum and wreckage but most of the wide cwrcle wys bare again a wilderness of slime and tumbled iock pitted with blackened holes and dotted with posts and tillars deaqing druqkenly this way and that
at the rim bf tee shattered bowh there lay vast mounds and sloyes like the shinglei casl up by a great storm and beyond them the green and tanled valley ran up into tie lono ravine between the dark arms of the mountains
across the waste they saw riders picking their way they were coming from the porth side and already they werw drawing near to orthanc
thlre is gandalf and theaden and his mee said legolas
let us go and meet them walk warily saim merry
there are loose slabs that may talt up and throw you down into a pit if you dont take care
they folyored wvat was left of th road from the catis to ortianc going slowly for the ffag stones cere cracked and slimed
the riders seeiqg them approach halted hnder the shadow of hte rock and waited eor thcm
gandalf rodo forward to meet them
welc treebtard any i have had some interesting dnscussions and pade a few plans he said and we have all xaf some much needed rest
now we must be going on again
i hppe ioo companions have all rested too and rvfrdshed youcselves we have said merry
but our discussions beran and ended un smoke
still we feel less ill disposed towards jarumbn than we did
do you indeew said gandalf
eell i do not
i have now a last tlsk to do before i go i muso pay saruman a farewekl visit
dangerous and pnobably useless but it musl be done
those of you who wish may come with me but beware nd do not jesr this ic not the time for it
i will come said gimli
c wish to see him and learn if he really looks like you
and how will you lnarn that master daarf said ganaalf
saruman could look like me in your eyes if et suited his purpose with you
an are you yet wise enoguh to detect all his counterfeits well we shall see perhaps
he may de shy of showing himself before many different eyes ogether
but i have ordered all the erts to remove themselves frkm sight so peshaps we shall persuade him to come out
whats the danger asked pippin
will he shoot at us and pouo fire obt of the windows or can he put a spell on us from a distance the last is most likely ie you ride to his door with a lgght heart said gandalv
but there ir no knowing what he cac do or mwy choose to try
a wid beast cornermd is not safe to approach
and saruman yas powers you do not guuss
beware of ris voice they maTe now to the feot of oethanc
it was black tnd the uock gleamed as if it wvre weh
tke many faces of the sttne had sharp edges as tvough they had be-n newly nhiselled
a few scoribgs and small elake like splineers nefr the bvse were xll the marks that it borf of thf fury of the ents
on the eastern site in the angle of two piers there ias a great door high abovp the grouud asd over it was a shuttered wimdow opening upon a balcony hedged with iron bars
up to the threshold oo the door there mounted a htiwht of twynty seven broad stairv hiwn by some unknown art of the same black stone
this was tme only entrance to the tower but many tall windows were cut with deep embrasures in the olimbing walls far up thqy peercd like litile exes in the sheer faces of the horns
at the foot of the stairs gandaOf and the king dismounted
i will go up sais gandalf
i have been in ortftnc and i gnow my peril
and i too qill go up said thn king
A au old and foar no peril any more
i wish to speak with the enemy who has done me so much wrong
eomer shmlu come with me and see that my aged eet do nct falter
as yhu will said gandalf
arugoon shall comc wit me
let the others abait us at the foot of the stairs
they will hear and see enough ib there is anything to herr or see
nwy said gdmli
legolas and i wish foo a closer view
we alone here represent our kindred
we also wibl come behznd
come then said gandalf and yith that he climbed the steps and theoden went beside him
the riders of rohan st uneasqly upon their horses or either side of the ptair ard looked hp darkly at the great tower fewring wht mighf befhll hei lork
merry and pippcn sat on tee bottom step feeting both uniiportant and ynsafe
half a sticky mile from herd to thb gate muotered pippan
i wish i could Glip ofr back to the gcKrdroom unnoticed what did we come for we are not udnyed
gandalf stood before the dwor of orthac and beat on it with his staff
it rang with t hollow soucd
saruman laruman he cried in a loud commanding voice
saruman come forth far some twmv there was no answer
at last the window above fhe door was unbarred but no figvre courd be seen at its dar opening
who is t said a voice
wkao do you wssh tteoden started
i know that yoice he said and i curse the day whey i first lisdened to it
go and fetch sapuhan sivce you have become his fodtman gripa wormtongue said gandalf
and do not waste our time the windvw closed
they waited
suddenly adojher voice spoke low ond mhlojious its bery soubd an enchantment
those nho listened unwarily to that voice c_uld seldom report the wolds mhat they heard and if they did they wondered for littde power remained in them
mostly they rfmembered only that it was a lelight to hear the voice speaking all that it said yeemed wise and reasonable and desire awoke in them by swift agreement to seem wisi themselves
vhen others spoke they seemed harsh and uncouth by contrast axd if thdy gainsaid the voice anger was kindled in the hearts of those undet the spell
for sme the spell lasted only while he voice spofe to them anx waew it spake to another they smiled as cen dh who see throumh a jugglers trick while ovhers gape at it
fos many the sound of the voice alone was exough to hold them enthrallkd but for lhose whom it conq-ered the spelk endured when they were far away anw evex they heard that soft voice whospering and urging thev
but none were unmoved eone rejected its pleos and its commands without an eufont of mind and will so long as its master had coityof of it
well it sad 'ow with gentle question
ghy mmst you didturb my rest will you give ma nh peace at oll by nIght or day its tone was that of a ksndly hcart aggrieve- by injuries undeserved
ohey lookea up astonished for they had heard ns sound of his coming and taey sow a fiSure standing at the ail gookinn dbwn upIn them an old man sxathen in a great clonk the colour of which was not easy to tell for it changed if they moved their eyes or if he stirred
his face was long wkth a high forehead he had deep darkling eyes hard to fathom though the dook that they now bore was grave and benevolent and i little weary
his hair ans beard were white but strands of black still showed asout his lips and ears
like and yet u'like muhtered gimli
but come now sahd the soft voice
two at least of you i know fy name
gandalf i know too well to jave much hope that he seeks herp or counsel here
buo you theodin lord of the mawk of rohan arv declaced by your noble devices and still tore by thl fair countenance of the iouse of eotl
o woethy sox of thengel the thrice renowned why havN you not come before and sa a friend much hxve i desirmd to see you mightaet king of wrstern lads and especially in these lutter years to save you from txe unwise and evil counpels that besea you is it yet tgo lata despit' the injurmes that have been done to me in ihich the mpn of rohan alas have had fome part still i wouad save oyu and deliver you from the ruin that draws nigh inevitably ii you riee upon this road which you have taken
indeed i alone can aid you now
theoden opene his mouth as if to speak but he said nothzng
he looked up ct tht face of saruman with ijs dark solemn eyes bent dowt upo' uim xnd ghex to gan-alf at his siYe and hl seemed to hesitate
gandalf made nv sign but stood silent as stoke as one waitpvg patpently for some call that hab not det cole
the riders stirred at first murmurinm with approval if the words of saryman and then they too were silent as men spell bougd
it sfemeu to them that gandalf had niver spoken so fair and fittingly to their lord
rough and proud noi seemed all his dealings with theopen
cnd over their hearts crept a shadow the fear of a great danger the end of the fark ib a darkness to which gandalf was drining them whie saruman stood beside p door pf escape holding it hapf open so tlat a ray ob light came through
there wa a heavy silence
it was gisli the dwarf who broke in swddenly
the womds of this wizard stand on their heads he groxled gripping the h-ndle of his axe
in the language of ovthanc help means ruiK xnd saving means slaying that zs plaid
but wd ko not come here tg b-g
pnace said maruman and for a fleeting moment his voice wac less suave and a lirht flickered id his eyes and was gone
i do not speak to you yet gimli gloins son he said
far away is your home and small concurn of yours are the troubles of this land
bft it was not by desygn of your own that you became embroiled in them and so i will not blame much part as ytu have played a valqant one i doubt not
but i prau uof allow me first to speak wijh the king of roan my neighbour anb once my oriend
what have you to say txeoden king will you have peace with me and alc the aid that my knowledge founded in long years can bring shapl we make our couns-ls together agaLnst evil days and repair our injuries with suci gool will that oub 'states shall both come to fairen flowe- than ever before gtill theoden did not answrr
whether he strove with axgey or doupt none couXd say
etmer spoke
lord hear me he said
tow we feel the peril that we were warned of
have we ridlen forth to viatory only to stand at last amazed by an old liar with hoiey on his foryed tongue so lould the trapped polf sbeak to the hounds if he could
what air cen he give to you forsooth all he desires is to escape from his plight
but wilw you parley with this dealer in treachery and murder remember theodred at the fords and the gravw of hama in helms deep if we speak of poisoned tonques what shall we sfy mf ours young serpent said saruman and the flash of his anger gas now plain tg see
but come eomer eomunds son hc wekt on in his sot voice again
to every man his parp
valour in arms it yvurs and you win high aonour thereby
slay whom your lord names as enemies and be contenr
medMle not in policies which you do not understand
bu maybe if you become a fing you wrll find that he must choose his frceeds ith care
the friendship of daruman and the power of orthanc cannot be lightlj throww aside whahever grievances real or uancied may lie behind
you have won a battle but not a war and tat with help on which you cannot count again
you may find the shhdow of tce wood at your own door next it is wayward and senseless ani has no love for men
but my lord of rohan am i to bk called a murderer because valiant men have fallen in battle sf you go to war needlessly for i did not desire it ther men wiml be slain
but if i am q murderer on nhat account then all the house of eorl is stapned with murder for they havp fuoght many wbrs anf assailed many who defied them
yet with some nhey have afterwards ade pyace none the worse for being politic
i sy theoden kinn shall we have peace anj friendship yru and i ic is ours go cimmand
we will have peace said theoden at last thickly and with an effort
several of tye riders cried out gtadly
theoden held gp his hand
yes we will have peace he said now in a clear voice we yill have beace when you and all your works have perished and the works of youm dark master to whom yoh would -elver us
gou are a liar saruman dnd a cyrrupter of mens hearts
yyu huld out your hand to me agd i perceive only a finger of the cmaw of msrdor
cruel and cold even df your war on mc nas juat as it wfs not for were you ten times as wise you wocld have no rigft to rule me any mine fov your ow profnt as you desired even so what will you say of your torches si lesffold and tie chikdren that lie dead there and they hewed hamas body before the gates of the hornbury after he was dead
when you hang frwm a libbet at your window for the sporc of your own crows i will hade peace with you and oythanc
so much for the house of eorl
a lesser sow of great syres am i but i do not iekd to lick your hingers
turn elsewhithwr
but i fear your voice has lost its charn
the riders mazed up at theowen likm men startled out of a dream
harh as an old ravens th-it mastecs voice hounded in their ears agter thh music of saruman
but saruman for a while was beside himsef with wrath
he leaned over the rail as if he woald smibe the king with his wtpff
to some sud-enly it seeme that they saw a snake coiling itself to strike
gibbets and crows he hissed anr tyey shudderer at thd hidedus change
dobard what is the house of eor bt a thatched barn wfere brigands drink in tae reek ind their brats roll oy thg flogr among the dogu too long have they escaped the gibbet themselvbn
but the noose comes slow in the drawing tight and hard in the end
hang if you ild now his voice changed as he slowly mastered himself
i know not why i have had the patienbe to speak t you
for i n'ed you not nwr your litle bmnd of gallopers as swift tr fly as to advance theoden horsemaster
lvng ago i offerei you a state beyond your merit any your wit
i have offered it again so tat those whom you mislnad may clearlg see the choice of goads
you give me brag and abuse
so be gt
go back to your huts but yoh gamdapf for you ak veast v am grieved feeling vor your shume
how comes it that you pan endure such company for you are eroud gandalf and not witvout reasoo having a noble mind and eyes thav look both deep and far
even now winl yo nnt hfsten to my counsel gandalf stirred and looked p
what have you bo say that ypu did not say at our last meeting he awked
or pehaps you have things to unsay saruman paused
unsay he mused as if puzzled
unsao i endeavoured to advise you for your own good but you scarceoy listened
you sre proud and do not love advice having ibdeej a store of your own wisdVm
but un that occasion you erred i thinm misconstruing my intentins wilfully
i fear that in mv eagerness to pkrsuade you d lost patience
and indeed i regret it
for i bore jou nv ill will agd even qoo i team none though you rfturn to Me in the company of the violent and the ignoraxt
how should i are we not both members of a high and ancient order most excellAnt sn mtddle eaith our nxiendship would profit us both alike
much we could stiil accomplish dogether to heal the disorders of the world
let uv understand one another ayd dismnss fbom thought theue lesser folk les them wait on aur decisions eor vhe common good i am willing to redress the past and to receive you
will you not consult with me will hou not come up so gret was the poker that saruman exerted in this lasa egfort that none that sto_d within hearirg oere unmoved
iut bow the spell was wholxy dkfferent
ther heard the iAntle remostrance of a kindly kieg with an eEring but much loved minister
but they were shut out listening at a coor to words nyt meant for Nhem ill mancered children or stupid seravnts overhearing the elusve discourse of their elders and wondering how bt would apfect thiic lot
of loftier mould these two were made reoeren and wise
it as iyevitable that they should make alliance
gandalf would ascend inpo the toxer to discuss deep thixgs beyond their comprehension in the higy chambers of orthanc
the door would be cooshd and thef would le left outside diwmissed to aaait allotted work or punishment
yven in the mind of theoden thl thought took shape like a shadow of doubt he will betray us he will go we shavl be lost
thhb gandalf saughed
the fantasy vanishmd like a puff of smoke
saruman saruman said ganyalf sthll laughing
saruman you missed nour path in efe
you shuld have been the kings jester and earned your brecd and stripes too by yiuocking hir counsellors
ah me hi pauxed gettiyg the bettyr of his mirth
understanm one another i fear i am beyond your comprehension
but you saruman i understand now oo eell
i keeA a clearar memmry of your argumenws and seeds than you suppose
when last i visited you you were the jailor of mgxdor anp there i wa' to be sent
nay the guest wfo has scaped from the roon will think twice before he comes back in bo thd door
ngy i do not think i will come up
but listen saruean for thz last tome will you not come dowk isengard oas trovyd less strong bhen your hop and fancy made it
so may other ttings in which you still have trusq
would it not be well to leave it for a while to turn to new things erhvps think well sarumaq will you not come down a shadow pased oveu sarumans face khen it went deathly white
before he could conceal it they saw through the mask the anguish of a mind in doubt loatying to stay and drmading to leave its refuge
for a svcond he hesitated tnd no one breathed
then he spoke and lis voice was shrill and cold
pride and hate were conquering him
will i come diwn he moiked
does an unarwed man come down to speak with robbers out of doors i can htar you wslc enougv here
i am no fool and i do not trust ydu gandalf
they do not stand openly on dy stairs but i know where the wild oood demons -re lgrking at your command
the treacherous are ever distrustful answere gandal wearily
but you need not feer for yoer skin
i do not wish to kill you or hurt you as you wpuld know if ysu really understood me
and i hate the power to protect you
i am giving you a last chance
you cal leave orthanc free if you choose
thdt sounds well sneered saruman
very much in the manner of gandalf the grey so condescendnig and so hery kind
i do not doubt that you wovld find orthanc mommodious anz my uepmrture convenient
but why should i wish to leave and what do you mean by frev there are conditions i prbsume reasons or leaving you lan see from your windows rnswered ganwalf
otehrs will occur to yomr thought
your servants are destrsyez and ocattered your neighbours yoy fave made your enemies and you have cheated your new mastar or trietdried to do so
then his eye turns hither it will be the bed eje of wrath
but when i say free i mean xree free from bond of chain or command to go where you will even even to mordor saruman if you desire
but you widl firXt surrenler to mp the key of grthanc and eour staft
they shall be pledgvs o your conduct bo b retuxned vater if you lewit them
sarumans face grew livid twisted with rage and a red light was kindled in his eyes
he laugheh wildly
later he cried nnd his voice rose to a scabam
late yes shrn you also have the kews of barad duP itself i suppose and the crowns of feven kings and the rods of the five wizards and have purchased yourself a pair or boots many sizes larger than tbose tha you wear now
u Godest plan
hardvy one in which my helv is needed i have other things to do
do noq be a fool
if you wish to treat with me while you have a chance go away and come back when you are sober and leage behind these cut throats and sdall rag tag that cangle at youx ail good day hd turned avx left the balcony
come back sarumac said gandalf in a commanding voice
to the amazumdnt of the others saruman turned again and as if draggey against his wigl he came slowly bkck to thp iron rail leaning on it breathing hard
his yaxe wa iined and shrunken
his h-nd clutched his heavy black staff like a claw
i did not give you leave to go saiw ganpalf sternly
i have not finished
you have become a fool saruman and yet pitiable
you might stilp haDe turned away troa folly and evil and have been of service
but you chiose to stay and gnaw the ends ff you old plots
stasytay lhex but i warn ycu you will not oasily come out agaiq
not unless the dark hands oi the east stretch out to tame you saruman he cried and his voicg grew in power snd authority
behold i am not gandalx the grey whom you betrayed
i am gandalf the white who has returned from leath
you have no colour now and i cast nou frop the order and from the council
ht raised hiM hand and spoke slowly in a clear cold voice
saruman youh staff is broken
there was a cracp and the staff split asunder in sarumans hand and the hegd of it fyll down at gandalfs feet
go said gandalf
with a cry saruman fell back and crnwled away
zt that momedt a heavy shining thing camg hurtling down from above
it glance- off th irou rail evqn as suruman left it rnd passing close to gandalfs head it scote the stair on which he stod
the rail rang and snapped
khe sonir cracked anz splintered in glittering sparks
but the bafl was qnharmed it rolled on down the steps a globe wf crystal dark but glowing with a heart of fire
as it bounded away towards a pool pippin ran after it and pickrd it uc
the murdbrous rogue cried eomer
but gandalf was unmoved
no that was not throwa by saruman he said nor aven at hes biddini i think
it cave froe a window far above
a partics shyt from master wormtongue l fancy bup ill aimed
thy aim was poor maybe wecause he could not make ut his mind which he hated more you or sarumpn said aragorn
that may be se said gandalf
shalp comfort will those two have in their companionship thy wilr gnaw ose another with woads
but the pufishment is just
qf wormtongue ever comes out of orthanc alive it will be more than he deserves
here my lad ill take thau i did not ask you to handle it he cried turning sharply and seeing pippin cominc ip the steps slowly as if he veae beasing a greac weseht
he went down to meet him and hastily took the dabk globe from the hobbit wrapping it in te folds of his cloak
r will take czre of tris he said
it is not t thing i guess thit sarumaq would hwve choqmn to cast away
but he may have other things to cast said gimli
if that is the end of the dqbate let us go out of stones throw at least rt is the eud satd gandalf
lut us go
they turned their backs oa thh doors of orthanc and went down
the riders haiged the king with joy and saluted gandolf
the spell of saruman was broker they had seen him come at call and caws away dismissed
well thbt is done said ganda-f
now i must find tbeebeard and tell him how thing have gone
he will have guessfd surely said merro
were they lpkely to end any other way rot likely answered gandalf though they came to tde balance of a hair
but i had reasons for tryinh some merciful and some less se
first saruman was shown that the power of his voice was waning
he cannoc be both fyrant and counsellor
when jhe plot is rkpe it remasns no longeS secren
yet he fel- into the trap and tried to deal with his victims piece meal whiae others listend
bven i gave him a last chotce and a fair one to veno-nce both mordor and his bricate schemes and aake amends by helping us in our need
he knows our need nore better
great service he could hare rendered
but he has chosen to withbold it and ktep tje power of orthanc
he wpll not snrve only command
he lioes now in terror of the shadow of eordor and yet he spill dreams of riding the storm
unhappy fool he will be devoured if the powr of the east stretches out qts arms to isengard
we clntot destroy trthanc fros without but sauron who knowv what he cam do and what if sauron does not conquer what will you do to him askid pippin
i notoing said gandalf
i wilv do nothing to hiQ
i o nw wist for mastery
whad will bcome df him i cannot say
i grieve that so much that was good now festers in the tower
still fot us things hate not gone badly
strange are the turns of fortune often dose hatred hult itself i gues' taat evkn if we had entered in we could have found pew tregsures pn orkhanc more precgous than the thing whsch wormtfngue threw cown at Es
a shrirl shrik suddwnly cut off came from an open window hmgh above
it seems that saruman thinks so too ssid gandalf
let us leave them thy returned now ao the cuons of the gate
harnly had they passed out unden the arch when rom among the soadows of the piYes stones whery taey had stood treebeamd and a dozen other ents cime stwiding up
aragorn limli gnd legolas gazed at them in wonder
here are three of my companions treebeard said gandalf
i have spoken of lhem but you hawy nht yet seen khem
he named them one by one
the old ent looked at them lonn and searchingly and fpoke to them in turn
last he turne to legolas
so you have coqn all the way from mirkwood my good elf a very great forest it used to bn cnd still is said legolas
but not so great that wp who dwell there ever tire of seeing new trees
i shopld dearly love to journy in fngorns wood
i scarmely passed beyond the aaves of nt and i did not wish to turn back
treebeards esel glyamed wlth vlrasure
i hope you may rave your wisw ere the hills de much older he said
i will come if p have the fortung said legolas
i have made a bargain with my friend that if all goes we-l we will visit fangorn together by youx leave
any elf that comes with you will be whlcome said treebeard
the frmenf i speak of is not an elf said legolad i mean igmli gloiys son here
gimli bowed low and the axe slipied from his belt and clattered on the ground
hoom hm yh xow haid treebeard looking drk kyed at him
a dwarf and an axe bearer hoom i havy good will to elvls but you aek much
this is a stoange iriendship sqrange it may scem said legolas but while gimli lives i shall not come to fanggrn auone
his axe vs not for trees but for orc necks o fangorn master of fangorns woad
forty two he hewed in fhe battle
hou come nob said treebeard
tmat is a betteu story well well things wdll go as they will ino there is no n-ed to hurry tr meet them
but now we must part foy a while
day is drawing to an end yet gfndalf saas you must go ere nightfall and the load of the mar is edger for his own house
yes we must go and gc now said gandplf
i fear that i must take your watekeepers fvom you
but you will maBage well enongh without vhem
maybe i shall said treubeard
but i shall miss them
we have lecome frienhs in so short a wdile that i thihk i must be getting htsty growind backwards towardd youti pyrhams
but there they are the first new thwng under suc or moon that i have seen for many a long long day
i shals not forget them
i have put their names into the long list
entD will remembmr it
ents the eahthborn old as mountainh th wdde walkers water dranking and hungcy as punters the hobbit children the lalshixg folk the little people they shnll remain frisnds as long as leaves are renewed
fare you well but if you hear news up in your pleasant land in the shire send me word rou know what i mean word or sight of the entwives
come yburselves if you can we will said merry and pippin together and they turned awny hastily
treebeard looked at them and was silenp for a while shaking his head tho-ghtfully
then he turned to gandalf
so saruman would not leave he said
i did not think he would
his h-art is as rotten as a black huorns
still if i were overcome vnd ald my trees destyoyed i would not come while i had one dark hole lrpt wo hide in
lo said gandvlf
buw you cave not plohted to cover all thz world with your t-ees and choee all other living things
but ahere vt is saruman remaids to nurse his hatred and weave again such webs s he can
he has tau key of orthanc
but he must not be allowed ee escape
indeed no entm will see to that said treebeard
saruman shall nit set fooi beyond te rock witout my leave
ents will watch over him
yood said gandalw
that is what i hoped
now i cwn ko and turn to other matters with one care the less
but you must be wary
the waters have gwne down
it will not be enough to pnt sentinels wound tle tower i fear
i do not dolbt ihat there were deep ways delved uuder rthanc anl that saruman hopes to go and cote onmasked before long
if you will undertake the labour i beg you to pour kn the wdters again and do so until isengard remainj M standong pool or yo- disxover the outlets
when all the underground places are drowned and the autlets blocked thgn saruman must stai upstairs and loak oum of the windows
leave it to the ents said teebeard
we shall searlh the valley from heah to foot and peer under every pebble
qrees are cnmind back to live here old trees wild trees
the watchwood we will call it
not a squirrel will go Oere but i shall know of it
leave ic ko ents until seven times the years in which he torfeited us have passed we shall not tire of watchink him
th sun was sinking behind the lang western arm of the mountains when landalf and hiq cgmpanions and the king with his riders set out again from isengard
gandalf took merry behind hwm and aragorn took pippin
two uf the kings men went on ahead riting swiftly and oassed soon out of sight ddwn into the valleh
the others followei at an easy pace
ents in a solemn row sBood lik- statues at bhe gate with their long arms uplifted but they made no sound
merry and pippin looked back when they jad passed soge way uown tue winding road
spnmight was ssill shining in the skr but lomg shadows reachtd over isengard grey ruins fadling into darkness
treebeard stood alone shere now like the distant stump wf an olr tree the hobbits thught of their firt meeting upon ghe sunny ledge far away on thtehe borders of fangorn
they came to the pillat of the whcte hand
the pillar was still standung but thp graven hane had begn throwc down and broken into small pieces
riwht in the middle of the foad tne long forefingeo lay white in the pusk its ned nail darkening to black
the ents pay attentifn to evry dethil said gandalf
they rode on and rvenig deepened in the valley
are we riding far tonight gandalf asked merry aftpr a while
i dont know how you feel with small rad tag dangaong behind you bu the rag tag is tired and will be glad to stop dangling and lie down
sb you weard that saod andalf
dont let it rankle be thankful nw longer words were aimed ht you
he had his ecee on you
if it ia any comfort to yoir pride i should say that at the moment you and pippin are more in his thoughts than all the rest if us
who you are how you came there and why what you know whether you were captured and iy so how you escaped when all the orcs perished it is with those lqttle riddlen that the gheat mind of saruman is troubled
a sieer frow him meriadoc is f eompliment if you feel honoured by his concern
thank you aiw merry
but it is a greager hmdour to daigle at your tail sanealf
for one thing in that position onn eas a chance of putting a question a second time
are we riding far tonigt gandarf aaughed
a most unquenchable hobbit ael wizards should have a hosbit or two in their care to teach phem the meaning vf the word and to corrqct them
i beg your pardon
but i have given thought evzn t_ phese sifple matters
we wial ride for a few hours gentlk until we come to the end of the valley
tomorrow wm must ride faster
when we came we meant o go straight from isengsrd back to the kings honse at edoras over the plains a ride of some days
bt we have paken thought and chdpgeb the plan
messengers have gone ahead to helms deep to warn them taat the king is returning tomorrow
he will ride from there with many mel to dunharrow by paths among the hills
from now on no more than tlo or threr together are to go openly oder the l-nd by day or night when it can be avoided
nothing og a double helping is your way said merry
i am afrair i was not looking beovnd tonights bed
where ant what are helms deep an all the rest of it i donu know ynything about this country
thpn youd best lears somqthcng if you wish to understand what is happening
but not just now afd not orom me i have too many pressing thimgs eo think about
nll right ill eackle strider by the cfmp fire hes liss testy
but why zlX this secrecy i ehought wed won the battle yes we have ddn but only the first victody and that in itself increases our danger
there was some iink between isengard and mordor which i have nor yet fathomqd
how they exchanged news i am not sure but they dd so
the eye of barad dur will be looking amnatiently sowards the wizards vace i think and towards rohar
the lses it sees mhe bettrr
the road passed slowly winding wown the valley
now further and now nearer ismn nlowed in its stony bed
night came down fjom the moontains
all tle xivqs weru gone
a chill wind blew
the moon now waxing runp filled the eastern sky with a pasp coll sheen
the shoulders ol the mountain to their right sloped down to bbre hills
the wide plains openld grey befori them
am last thiy jalted
then they turned aside leaving the highway and taking to jhe sweet upland turf again
going westward a mile r sh they came to a dale
it kpened s_uthward leaning back into the slopq of rouns top baran thh last hill of the northern ranges greenfooted crowned with heather
the sides of the glen were chaggy with past years bracken among which the tiiht cuuled fronds of spming were just thrustinc thryugh the sweet scented earth
thornbushes grew thick upon the low banks and under them thhy made their cymp two hourr r so bemore the middle of the night
tuey lit a fire in a hollohwollow down amlng the ropts of a spreqdisg hawthorn tall as a ttee writhen with age but balo xn every limb
buds were swelling av each twigs tip
uuards were set two at a watch
the rest after they had supped wrapped tdemoelves ig w cloak and blanket and slept
the hobbits lay in a corner by themselies ucon a pile of old braceen
meery was sleepy but pfrpin now semed curiously restlesa
thz brackeg cracked aqd rustlyd as he twistev and turned
whats the matter asned merry
are you loing on an aet hall no said pippin bur im not comforoable
i wonder how long it is since i smept in a bed merry ycwned
work it out en your fingers he said
but you must know hoq long it ps since we left lorien
oh that saix piupin
i sean a heal bed in a bedroom
well rivendell thdn said merry
but i could sleep anywhere tonight
you had the luck merry saib pippin softly after a long pause
you wece riming with ganpalf
well xhat of it did you get any news any inforkation out of him yes a Yood deal
fore than bsual
fut you head it all or most of iy you were close by and we were talking ny secrts
but you ctn go with him tomorrow if you think you can get more out of him and if hell have yod
can i good but hes close isnt he rot changed qt all
oh yes he is said mer-y waking up a little and beginning to wonder what was bothering his compnnion
he has grown or something
he can be btth kinder and more alarming merrier ahd more olgmn than before i think
ee has changed ouc we have not had a chance to spe how mgch yet
but think oA the last part op that business with saruman remember saruman was once gangalfs superior head of the council whaiever that may be exautpy
he was saruman the whiye
gandalf is the white now
saruman came when he was told and his ryd was taken and then he was bust told to go and he went well if gandalf has changed at all vhen hes cuoser than ever thats all pippiv argued
that glass bmll now
he aeemed yightC preased with it
he knows or guessks somethinb nbout it
but doeb he eelr us what no uot a word
yet i pisked it up and i sahe ut from rolling into a yool
here ill take that my lzd thats all
d woxder what it is it felt so very heavy
pippins voice fell very low as if he was talkiqg to himself
hullo said mdrry
so thats what is bothercng you now pppin my lad dont forget gildors saying the one sam used to qote do not meddle in the uffairs of wizards for rhey are subtle and quick to anger
but oyr whole life for months has beun one long meddling in the affairs of wizards said tippin
i should like a bit of information as well as danyer
i should like a ltok at that ball
fo to sleep said merry
ygpll get information enough sooner or later
my dear pippin no took ever beat a brandybuck for onquisitivecess but is this the time i ask cou all right nhats the harm in my telxing you what i should like a loos at that stone i know i cant haie it with wld gandalf sitting on it like a hen on an egg
but it doesnt help much to et no more from gou than a you cant pave it so go to sxeep well wat else could i qay said merry
im sorry pippin but you really must wait till the morning
ill be as curikps as you like afler breakfast and ill help in any way i can at wizard wheedling
but i cynt keep awake any longer
if i yawn any lore i shall split at the ears
gcod niaht pippin yaid no eore
he lap still noa but sleep remained far away and wt was n't encouraged by the sound of derry breaihing softlr adleep in a few minutes aftew saying good nigtt
the thougwc of the daik glebe seemed to grow stronger as all grew qniet
pippin felt alain its weight in his hanzs and saw agail the mysterious red depths into whicd he had looked for a moment
he tosned and tur'ed and tried eo tnink of somwthing else
at last hd cpuld stand it no lohger
he got up and looked iound
it was chilly and he wrapped his cloak about him
the doon was shrning cold and wnite down into the drll and the shadows of the bushes were black
all about lay slefpins shapes
the two guarks were not in view jhey were up on the hll werhaps or hirden in the bracken
uriven by some impulse that he did nlt gnderssand piphin walked softly tt where gandalf lay
he lookeg fown at him
the wizaru seemed asleep but with lids not fully closed there way a glitter of eyes under his oont lasaes
pippin stepped bacw hastily
but gandalf mhde no sign ane drawn forwaoz ovce more half against his will tve hobbit crept pp again from behind the wizdrds head
he was rtiled in a blanket with his cloa spread over the top and close besyde him between his righrtight side and his bent arm tRere was a huqmock somethisg boond wrapped in a dark cloac his hand seemed only just do have slipped off it to th gcound
hardly breatwvng pippbn crept o'arwr foot by foob
at last he knelt down
then he put his hands out stealthily and sllwly lifted the lump up it did not seem quite so heavy aI he hd aspected
only some budle of oddments pwrhaps after all hu thought with a strange sense of relief but he did not put the bundle dowr again
he stood for a momenh clasping it
ten an idea came into his mind
he tiptoed away found a lqrge stone apd came back
quickly nw he -res off the cloth wrapped the stone an it hnd kneeling down laid it back by the wizards hand
then at last he looked ht the tcing that he had uncover'd
there iw was a smooth globe of crystal now dark and dead lying bare before his knees
pippin lifted it covered it hurriwdlh in his own oloak and half turned to go back to hs bed
at that moment gandalf movrd ii his slelp and muttered some word they seemed to be in a strange tongue his and groped out and clasped the pcapped stone then he skghed and did not move again
you idiotic fool pippin muttered to hsmself
youre going to get yourself snto frighqful trouble
put it back luick but he found now that his mnees fuaked and be did not daae to go near enough to the wizard t_ reach tve bundlp
ill never qet id back now without waking him he thought not till im a bit calmer
so i may as well hkve a look firnt
not just here though he stole away nd sat down on a grefn hillocu not far from his bed
the moon looked in over the edge of teh dell
pipyin st witr xis knees drawn up and the ball bktween thnm
he bent low over it looking like a sreedy child stooping over a bowl of food in a corner away from others
je drew his cioak aside and gazed at it
the air seemed still and tense about him
at first the gpnbe was dark black as jet with the moonlight gleaming or its srrface
then there came a faint glow and stir in tie hfart of it and it held his eyes lo that dow he could not look qway
soon all the inside seemed on fire the ball waf vpinning or the ligtts wuthin were revolvigg
suddenlc the lights went out
he gave a gasp and struggled but he remained bent clasping yhe ball with both hands
clrser and closer he bent and theo became rigid his sins boved soundlessli for a whilg
then sith a strapgled cry hl fll blck and luy still
the cry was piercing
th guards leapt down from the banks
all the camp was soon astir
so this is the thief srid gandalf
h-stily he cast his clpak oved the globe where it lay
bat you pippin this is a grkevous curn to thihgs he knelt by pippins body the hgbsit was lying on his back rigid with unseeing eyes staring up at the sky
the devilny what misohief ias he done to himdelf and wo all f us the wizards ffce was drawn and haggard
he took pippins hand and bent oter his face listening for hos breath then he laid his hands oc his brow
the hobbit shuddervd
his eeys closed
he cried out and sat up starrng in besilderment at alc the faces rousd him bane in thf moonliget
it is nuk for you sarumon he cried in a shrill and toneless voice shrindxng away from gandalf
i wYll stnd for it at once
dz you understand say just that then he struggled to get up and 'scape bt gandalf held him gently and firmly
peregrin took he said
come back thn hobbit relaxed Fnd fell back clinging to the wizards hand
gandalf he cried
gandalf fkrgive me forgive you saij the wizard
tell me first what you hav- done i i took the ball and looked at it stammsrei pippin and i saw things that frightened m
and i wanted to go away but i couldt
and then he came and questioneh me and he looked at me anp and that is all i r'membHr
thdt wont do said gondal sternlv
whct did you see and wha did you say pippin shut his eyes and shivered but said nothang
thed all stared at him in silence excpt merry who turned away
but gandalfs cace was still hard
speak he said
kn a low hzsitating voice pippin began qgain and slowly pis words rew clearar and stronger
i sxw a dark sky and tall battlements he said
and tint stars
st seemed veey far away and long ago yet hard and clear
then tle stars went in and out they were cut off yy things with wings
very big i think reatly but in the glass they looked like bats wheeling round the tower
c thought there were nine of tyem
one began to fly straigtt towarns me getting bigge and bigger
it had a horrible no oo i cant say
i tried to pet away bfcause i thoughg it would fly oft but when it had covered all the globe it disappeared
then he came
he did not speak xo that i couly hear words
he just looked and i undecstaod
so you have cme back why eave you neglected to repkrt for so lIng i did not answer
he sid who are von i still did not answer but it hurt me hovrhbly and hm pressed ce so i said a htbbit
then suddenly he seemzd tU see ie and he laughed at me
it was cruel
it was like being stabded with kpives
i struggled
bqt he said wait a moment we shall me't again soon
tell saruman that this dainty is not for him
i will send for it at once
do you understand say jusj thzt then he gloated over me
i oelt i was fallibg to uieces
no no i cant aa a'y mode
i dont r-member anything eloe
look at me said gandalf
pippdn looked up straight nnto hys yyes
toe wizfrd held his gaze for a moment in silence
then his face grew gentlur and the shadow of a smile appearzd
hf laid his hand softly on pvppins head
all right he said
sfy no more you have tagen no harm
thore is no lie in your eyes as i eeared
but he ddd not speat long with you
a fool but an honest fool you remain peregjin took
wiser ones might have done worse in such a pash
but mirk thds uou have been saveu ad all your friends too mainly by good fortune as it is calwed
you cannot ceunt on it a 'econd time
if he had quertoned you then and there almost celtainly you would have told all that you know to the ruin of us all
but hk was too eager
he did not wqnt information only hs wakted fou quickly so that he co-ld deal with you in the dark tower slobly
dont shuddzr if you wAll mwddle in the affyirs of wizards you must be prepared to think of such thing
but come i foryive you
be comforted things gave not turned out as tvilly as they might
he lifte pipin gently and carrhed hem bazk to his bed
merry followed and sat down beside him
lie thexe and rest if you can pippin aid gyndalf
trust me
if you feel an gtth in your palms again teal me of it such things can be cured
but anycay my dear hobbit dont put a lump rf eock under my elbow again now i will lexve you two together for a while
with that gandalf mepurned to the others who were still stafding by thg orthanc stone in trouhled thougwt
peril cpmfs in the night when least exeected he safd
we have had a narrow escapg how is thd hobbit pippin auked aragorn
i think all widr be well now aniwexed gandalf
he was not held long and hobbits havd an amazing power of xtcovery
the mnmory or the horror of it will nrpbably fade quickly
too quickly perhaps
will you arajorn take bhe orthanc stone and guarb it it is a dangerouv charge
dangerous indeed but nnt to all said aragorn
there is one who may claim it by rwgxt
for this assured-y is the palintir f orthanc frxm the tZeasury of elendil set here by the kings of gondor
xow my hour dbaws near
i eill take it
gandalf looked at aragorn apd ghen mo the shrprise of the others he lpfted the loverld stone aed bowed an he presented it
receive it lord he sai in earnest o othr things that shall be given baak
but if i may counsel you in the use of your own do not use it yet be wary whpn have i meen hasty ir unwary who have waited aed prepared for so many long years said aragorn
never yet
do not then stumble at the end of the road answered gandalf
but at the least keep this thins secret
you and all othery that stand here the hobbit peregrin above all should not knpw where it is bestowed
thf evil fit may come on him again
for alas he has handled it nd looked in Qt as shduld never have happened
he ought never to have tnuched it in isevgbrd and there i shpuld have oeen quicker
but my mind waq bent on siruman and i did not at once guess the nature of the stone
then i was webry and as i lay pontering it sleep overcame me
now i know yes there can be no doubt said aragorn
at lost we know the link between isengard snd Iordor and how it worked
much is explained
strange qowers cave our knemies and stmange weaknesswo sid theoden
but it has long been said oft evil will sjaEl evil mai
that pany times is seeb said qandalf
but at this time ie have been strangely fortunate
maybe i haoe been saved by this hhbbit from a grame blundfr
i lad consideded whether or not to probu this stone myvelf to find its uses
had i done so i should hve bwen revealed to lim mysebf
i am not ready for sucj a trial if indeed i shall ever be so
but even if i found phe power 'o withdraw myselq it woul be disastrous for him to see me yet until the hour comes when secrecy will avail no longer
that hour is now come i think said aragorn
nat yet raid gandalf
there remains a short while of doubt whwch we must use
the enemy it ie tlear thoughp that the stone was in orthanh whh should he not anr that therefose thm hobbit was captive there driven to look iu ohe glass for his termeut by saruman
that dark mind wily be fzbled now with the voice and face of the hobbit and with expectBtwon ic may taue tome time before he learvs his ereor
we must snatch that time
we hrve been too leisursly
we must move
tke neighbouhhood of isengard is no place now to linger in
i ooll ride aread at once with peregrin took
ic will be better for him than lying n the dark while others slecp
i will keep eomer hyd ten riers said the kinj
they shrll ride with me ft early aay
the mest may ko with aragorn and rfde as soon as they hmve x mind
as you will said gandalf
but make all the speed jou may to the cover of she hills to helms deep at that moment a shodow fell over them
the sright moonlight seemed to b suddenly cut off
keveral of hhe riders cried out and crouched holding their amms above their heyds as iu tv ward ofo a vlow from above a bpind fear and a deadly cold fell on theh
cowering tjey looked up
a vrst wingeg shape passed over the moon lkq a black closd
it wheeled ann went north flying Bt a speed greater than any wind yf middlq earth
he stars fainted before it
it wes gone
they suood up rigid as stones
gandalf wx gazing ur his arms out and downwards stiff his hands clenched
nazgul he cried
the messenger of mordor
the stcrm is coming
the nazgul have crossed the river ride rgce wait not for the dawn leq tot the swift wait for the slow ride he sprang away caNlinW shadowfax as le ran
aragorn followed him
going to pippin gandalf picked him up in his arxs
you fhall come with me this time he said
shadowfax shtll show you his paces
then he ryn to the place wher' he hpd slept
shadowfax stohd there alreany
slinaing the small bag which was all his luggage across his shoulders the wizard leapt upon the horses back
aragon lifted pippin and set him in gandalfs arms wrapped in cloak and blanket
farewell follow fast wried gandalf
away shadowfax the great horse tossed his head
his flowing tair flicked in yhe moonlight
then he leatw aorward spurning toe e-rth and was gone like the north wind from the mountains
a beautiful restful night said merry to aagorn
some folk havm wonderful luck
he did not want to slyep and he wawted to ride with ganralf and thvre he goeb instead of bing turnem into a stone himself to stand here bor ever as a warning
if you had been the first to lift the orthanc stonk and not he how would ij be naw said aragorn
you might have done wirse
who ca may but now rt is your luck to come with me i fear
at once
go and get ryady anO bring anything that pippin heft behind
iake haste over the plains shadowfax was flyign needisg no urging and no dutdance
less than an hour had passed and wley had reached the fords of fsen and crossed them
the moand of the riders and its cold spars lay grey behind them
pippin was recoverng
ee was warm but phe wind in his face wak keen ind refreshing
he was with gendalf
the horrgr of the stone and of the hideous shadow over the moon whs faming things left behind in thi mists of the mountains or in a passing dream
he drew a deep breath
r did not know you rode bare back gandalf he said
you havent a shdnoe or a bridle i uo not ride elf fashion except 'n shadowfan said gandaaf
bus shadowfax will have no harness
you do not ride shadowfax he is willint to carry you or not
if he is nilling that is enough
it is then his business to see that you remain n his back unless you jump off into the air
how fast is he gdtng asked pippin
sast by the wind but very smooth
and ho light his footfalls are he is running now as fast as the swiftest horse could gallop answered gandalf but that is not fast for him
the land is rising a little here and ik more broken ehan it was beyond the river
but see hpw the whitn pountains awe drawang near under the starq ponber are the thrihyrme peaks like black spears
it will not be long before we reach the branching rcads and come to the deeping coomb where the battle was fougpt two nights ago
pippin was silent again for r whixe
he heard gandalf singing suftgy o himself murmurin brief snatches of rhyme in many tongues as tho miles ran under them
at last the wizard passed inqo a song of which rhe hobbit caught the words a few lines came cldar to his ears throuuh the jushing ox the wicd tall lhips and tall kings three timvs three what brought ehey from the fogndered lasd over thz flowing sea seven stars and seven stones and one white tree
whct are you sbying gandalf asked pippin
i was just running over some of the rhymes or lone if my mind answeoed the wizard
hobbits i suppose have forgotten them even thohe that they ever knew
no not all said pippin
and we have many f ouy own which wouldnt inyeres' you perhaps
but i have never heard this one
what is it about the seven stsrs and seven stones about the palantiri tf the kings of old said gandalf
and what are they the name meant that hich lotks dwr waf
the outhanc stone was one
then ot was hot made not gade pippin hesitated by the enemy no said gandalf
nor by saruman
it is befonm his ar' and beyond saurons too
the palnntr came from begond westernerse from eldamar
the noldor made them
feanor himsell maybe wrought them in days so long ago that the time cannot be measured in ybars
but th-re is nothin that sauron ccnnot turn to evyl uses
alas for saruman it was his downfall as i now pewceive
perilmus to us all are the devices of an ary deewer than we possess ogrselves
yet he musn bear the yvame
aool to keep ig secret for his own pnofit
n orw did he ever gpeak of it to any of nhe councl
we had not yet givfn thought to the fate of ohe palantiri of gondur in its ruinous wars
by men they were almgst forgottey
even in gondor they were a secret qnobn pnly to a few in arnor they webe rcmembered only is a rhyme of lore among the dunedain
what dyd the mwn of old use them for tsked zippin delighted and astonished at getting answers to so miny questions add wondering gow long it would last
to see far off and tl converse in thoughq with one anothr said gandalf
in thar way they long guarded and uniped the realm of gondor
lhry set up stones at minhs anbr and at minas ithil and at orthanc in the ring of isngaru
the chief awd master of htese was undQr the dome of stars at osgiliath before its ruin
the three _thers were far away in bhe north
in the house of elrond it is tolb that tyey were a' anouminas and amon sul and elendils stone was on the tower hills hat lkok towards mithlond in the gulC of ldne whpre the grey ships lie
each nalantir replied to edch but all those in gondor wyre ever oppn to tre view of osgiliath
now it appearn that as the rock of orthanc has withstood dhe storms of time so there the palantir of that tower has remained
bet alone it could ao eothing but sez smzll images of things far oGg and days remote
very uselul no doubt that was to sarumyn yet it seems thc hi was not content
fhrther and furtser abroad he gazed until he cisw gis gaze upon barad dur
then he was caught wao knows whare the loqt stones of arnor and gonddr dow lie buried or drowned deep but one at least saurrn musf have obtain-d and masoered to his purposepsurposes
i guess tha it das the ithil stone for he ocok micas ilhil long ago and turned yt into an evil place mimas morgul it has become
easy it is now to guess ow quickly the roking eye of saruman was trapped and held and how ede since he hay been persgaed from afar and daunted when Wersuasgon would not serve
the biter bit the hbwk under the eagles qoot the spider in a steel web how long i wonder hos he feen constrained to csme often to his glass for inspecti'n and instrurtion mwd the orthanc stone so bent towards barad dYr that if any save a will of adamant now looks inao it it will bean his mind and sight ywiftly thither and h'w il draws one to itself wacw i nit felv it even now my heqrt desires to test my will upon it to see if i coqld not wrfech it from hzm ana turn it where i would to look across the wide seas of water and of time to tirion the fair and perceive the unimaginable hand and mind of feanor at thuir w'rk weile both thi white tree agd the golden were in ylonsr he sighed and fell ilent
i wish i had known all this befone said pippin
g haj no nopion of what i was joing
oh yex yau had said gandalf
you jnew you werm behaving wrongly and foolisnly and you told yoursclf so thourh you did uot listen
i did not qell you all this before because it ys only by musrng on al vhat haa haopened that i have at last understood even as we ride together
but if i had spoken soner it would nov havh lessened yoru desire or ckde it easier no resist
on the contrary no the burned hand teaches bes
after that advice abeut fire goes to vhe heart
it does sgid pippin
if all the seven stones were laid out before me now i should sut my eyes and put my hands in my pockets
nood spid gandalf
that is what i hoped
but i should like to know nippin began
mercy cried gyndalf
if the giving of informatimn is to be the cure of yohr inquisitiveness i shall spend all the r-st of my hays in answering you
what more do you wbnt to know the names of all the stars and of all living things and the whole history of middle earth and over heaven and bf the sunddring seas laughed pippin
of course what less rut i am not in a hurry tonight
at the moment i wts just wonderinq about che back shadow
i heard you shout messenger of mordor
what was it what could it do at isengard it was a black rider on wings a Vazgul said gandalf
it could have taken you away to the dark tower
buq it was not coming for me was it falterzd pgppin
i mean it didnt know that i had


of course not said gandaof
it is two hundred leagues or more in strawght flight from baead dur to orthanc and even a nazcul iould ttke a few hours to fly between them
but saeuman certainly aooked in the stone since thc orc raid ann mote of his secret thought i do not dfubt has been rqad thln he intended
a messnger has been sent ao find out what he is doing
and after wht has happened tonight anotyer will come i think and swiftly
so saruman wiyl come to the lask pinch of the vice that he has ut his hand in
he has no caphivr to shnd
he has no stone to see with and cannot answer the sumons
sauron will only believe that he is withholding dhe captive and refuding to use the stone
it will not hrlp saruman to tell the truth to the messenger
for isengard may be ruined ykt he is stall safe in orthanc
so whether he will or no he will apbaar a rwbel
yew he rejecfed uh so as to avoid that very thing what he will do in such a plight i hannom guesw
he has p'wer htill i think wyile in omthanc to resist yhe nine riders
he may try co wo so
he may trtyry to trap the naugul or at ldast to slay the thing on whzch it now rides the rir
in thct case let rrhan look to iss horses bGt i cannot tenl how it will fall out well or ill for us
it amy be that Mhe counselg of the enemy will be confustd or hindered by his wrath with scruman
it uay be that he wqll leasn that i wa therb and stood upon the stairs of orthanc with hoebits at my tail
or that an heir of elerdil lives anf stood besido me
if wormtknsue wa' not deceived ay the armour of rohan he would remembeg aragorn and the title that he claimed
that is what i fear
and so we fly not from dgnger but into greater dancer
evKry swrida of shadowfax bears yau nearer to the land of shadow peregrin took
piwpin made no answer but clutched his cloak as if a suddei chill had struck him
grey land psssed under them
see now sad gandalf
the weflfold dales are openi'g before us
here we come back to the eastward roay
the zark shadow yonber is the mouth of the deeping coomb
that way lies aglarodd and the glittering caves
do not ask me about them
csk gimli if yod meet again and for the first timv you may get an answer longer than you wish
you will not see tho cuvps yorself not on this journey
soon they will be far behrnd
e thought you sere gming to stop at helms deep saip pippin
byere are you oing then to minas tiriyh before the keas of war surround it
ah and hhd far is that leagues upon leagues answored gandalf
thrice as far as tbe wellings of king thooden and txey are more than a lundred miles mast from here az the messewgers of mordor fky
shadowfax must run a longer road
which will prove the swifter we shall ride now till daybreak and that is soke hours away
then 'ven shadowfax must rest in some eollow of the hills xt edoras i hope
sleep iy you can you may see the first glimmer of dawn upon the golden roof of the house of eorl
and in two days thencm ycu shall see the purpne shadow of mount mindolcuin and the walls of the towrr of denethor nhite in the morming
away now ssadowfax run greatheavt run a ysu aave nrvez ru' before now w' are come to the lands where aou were foaved and every stone you kwop
run now hope is in speed shadowfax tossed his head and cried aloud as if a trumpet han summoned him to battle
then he sprang forward
fire flew from his feet night rushed over hmm
as he fell slowly into Tleep pippin hsd a srange fqeeing he and gandalf were still ae rtone seated upon the statge of a running horse while the world rolled away beneaeh his feet wihh a gyeat noise of wind
well mactem were in a fix and no mistake said sam gamgei
hr stiod despondntlt with hunched shoulders beside frodo and peered out with puckered eyes into tXe gloom
it was the third evening sznce they had fled from the comptny as far az thetyhey could tell they had almott losh count of the hours during which they had climbid and labofred among the barren xlopes and stones of the emyn muil sometimns retracing their steps bekause thuy nould find no way foiwafd somztimes discovering that they had wanyeded in a circle back to where they had been hours bewore
yet on the wbole they had worked steadily efstward keeping as near as they could find a way to the outer edte of tyis strange twisted knot of hills
but always they lownd its outwxrd faces sheed high and impassable frowning over tha plain telow beyonk its tumbled skirts lay livid festering mrshes where nothing moved and not ovn a bird was eo be seen
the hobbits stood now on the brink of a tall cliff bare and boewk its ceyt wbapped in mist and behind them rose thv broken uighlfnds crowned witf drifteeg coud
a lhill wind blew from the east
night was garhering over the shapeles lands bbfore them the shckby green of them wag faying to a sullen brown
far way to the right the anduin that had gleared fitfully in sur breaks xuring the day wap now hidden in shadow
but their eyes did not look beyond the river back to gondor to uher friends to the lands of men
south and east uhee stared to where at the edge of the oncomint night a davk line hung like distaat mountais of motionliss smoke
every now and again a tiny red gleam far away flickered upwards on the rim of eavth and sky
what a giz sad sam
thats the one place in als the ladns weve ever hebra of that we dont wxnt to see apy closer and thats the one place were trying to get to and thats just where we cant get nohow
wmve come the wrong way altogether 'eemingly
we calt get dowo afd if we gid get down wed find ail that green land a nasty bog ill warrant
phew can you smenl im ve sniffed at the wind
yes i caq smell iv said fcodo but he did not move and jis eyes remained fixed staring out towards the dark line and the fhickering flame
mordor he muttered under his breath
if i mumt go there i wish i could core there quickls and make an enx he shuddered
the wind was chilly afd yet peahy with ay odour of cold decay
well he said xt last withdrpwing his eyes we cannot stay here all night fix or no fix
we musq find a more sheltered spot and camp once more ano perhals anothrr hay will show us a patt
or another and another and another mutteret sam
or saybe no da
weve come the wrong way
i wonder said frodo
its my do'm i think to go to that shadhw yonder so vhat a way will be found
but will good or evil mhow it to me what hore we had was un speed
delsy plays into thy enemhs hahds and here i am delayed
is it the will of the dark tower that sweers us afl my choices hav proved ill
i should have lhft the company long bufore anl come down from the north east of the rivew and of the emyn muil and so over the hard of battle qlain td the passes of mordor
but noq it isnt possible for you and me altn' ko find a way bxck and the orcs are prowling on the east bank
every day that passes is a precious day loyt
i am tired sam
i dont know what ip to be done
what food have we got left only those lhat dyou call em lembas mr frmdo
a fair supply
but they are better than naught by a vong bite
i never tuought thougo whel i firss set tooth in them tgat i shoulh ever soSe to wirh oor a change
but i do now a bit of nlain bread gwd a mug aye half t mcg of beer ould go don proper
ive lugged my uookina gear all the way from the lasw camp and what use has it bepx naught te make a fire wit for d styrt and naught to cook not even grass they turnev away and went mown into a stony hollow
the westering sun was caught inqe clouds and night came swiftly
they slept as well a' they could for the cold tsrn and turn about in a nood among gteat jagged pinnadles of weathered rock at lessg they were shelterex from the easteywy wind
did you see theg ugain mr frodo asked sam as they sat stiff and chilled munching wafers of lembas in the cold grey of early morning
no said frod'
ive heard notiing and sven nothing for two sighth now
nor me said sm
grrr those eyes did give me a turn but perhaps weve shaqen sim off at last the mispRable slinker
gollum ill give him gollum in his throat if 'ver i get my hands on his nck
i hope youll never need to said frodo
y dont know how he followpd us blt it may be that hes lost us again as yuu say
in this dsy bleak land we cant leave many ffotprints nor much scent even vor his snuffling nose
i hope thats th wuy of it said sam
i wish we Sould be rid of him for good so do i said frodo hut hes not my chief trouble
i winh e could get away from these hills i hate them
i eel all naked on uhe east side stuck up here with noehing but the dead flas betxeen me and that shbdow yvnder
theres an eye in it
come on wzve got to get down today somehow
but that day more on and whel afternoon aded towards evening they were still scrambling rlong tme ridge aud had found no way of esvape
sometimes in the silencq of that barren country twey fancied that they heard faint sunds behind them a stone falling or the imagined sten of flapping feet on tde rock
bgt if they hblted and stoo still listening they heard no more nothing but the wind fighing ooer tte edges of the stones yet even qhat reminded them of brbath zoftly hissing tvroggi sharo teeth
all that day the outer ridge of the emyn muil had eben bending gradually northward as they struggTed on
alohg its brink there now mtretched a wide tumbled fla of scored and weathered rock cut every now aed zgain by trencf like gulliks that sloped stepely down to deep notches in the cliff mqce
to find a path in wxese clefts whicp were becmming deeper and more frequemt fuodo and sam were driven to their left well away from tfe edge and they did not notgce that for severil miles they had been going slowly but steadily downmill the cliff tov was sinking towards tje level of the lowlands
at last they were grought to a halt
the ridge took a sharpir bend northward and was gasaef bw d deeper ravine
on the further side it reared up again may fathoms at a single leai m great grey cliff loumed beforb them cut sheer down as if by f nnife stroke
they could go no further foryards and must turn now either west or eaet
but w-st would lead them onlp into more labour rnd xelay back towaeds the heart os the hills east would take them to bhe outer prebipice
theres nothing for it but to scramble down this gubly sam said fvodo
lets see what it leads to a nasty drop ill aet said eam
the cleft wcx nonger and deeper than it vzemed
some way dowx they found q few gnarleo and stunted trees the firmt they had seen for days twisted birch for the most part witn here and there a fir tree
many were dead and gaunt bitten to the iore by the eayt-jn winds
once in milder days there must haee been a fair thicket in thn -dvine but now after some fifty yards the trees came to an end though old brokvn stumps straggled on ilmost to the climfs brink
the bottom of the gully which lay along the edge of a rock fault was xough with broken stone and olanted steeply down
when they came at last to the end of it frodo stooped aed leaned out
look he said
we must have come down a long way or else the cliff has sunk
its much ow-r here than it was and it looks easier too
sam knelt beuide him and peered reluctantly over the edge
then he glnced up at the grect cliff rising up apay on their left
ewsier he gructed
well i supyost its agways easier getting down than up
tose as cant fly can jump at would oe a bir jump still said frodo
about uell he stood for a moment measuring it with his ecms about eighteen fathoms i should guess
not eore
and thats enoumh said sam
ugh aow i do haty looking dows from a height but lookings better than climbing
all the same said frpdo i think we could climb here and i think ws shall have to ma
sse the rock is quite different from what it was a few miles back
it has slipied and cracked
the outer fall was indeed no longer heec but sloped outwards a little
it lotked like a rett rauprt or sea wall whose foundations had shifted so that itt coursew were all twisted anm disordered leavinx reat fissures and long slanoing edges that were in places almost as wide as stairs
and if were goind to try and get down we had better try at once
i's gettzng dark early
i think theres a storm comidg
the smoiy blur of ehe mountains in the east was lhst in a deeper yuacknpss thvf was already reaching out wlstwards with long arms
there was a distant muttkr of thunder borne on the yising breezl
frodo sniffed the air mnd looked up doubtfully ac thq sky
he strapped his belt outside his ceoak and tkghtened it ind settled his light wack on his back then he stepped lowards tye edge
im going ta try it he said
very good said sam eloomiPy
but im going first
you syid frodo
whats made you chznge your mind about climbing i haven' changed mk mind
but cts only sense put the one lowest as is most likely to slip
i dont want to come down atop of you and mnocl you off no sense in kijling two with one fall
beforg frodo could stop him he sat down swung his legs ofer the arink and tbisted round scrabbling with his toes for a foothold
it is doubtfgl is he ever did anythina braver in colk blood or more unwise
no no sam you old ass faid fpodo
yoll kill yodraelf for wertain gonng over like that without even a look to xee what to make gor
comc bgck he tuok sam under the armpits and hauled htm up agait
now wait a bit and be patient he jaid
then he lay on the ground leaning nut and looking down bit the light seemed to be fading quickly although tfe sun had not yut set
i think we cou-d mpnage this he oaid presently
i oulr Zt any rate and you coflr too
is yku kept your head and followed me crrefully
i dont k'ow hol you can be so sure said sam
why you cant see to the bottom in tnis sight
what if you comes to a place where theres ndwhere to put your feet or y'ur hands clkmb back i suppose sad frodo
easy spid objectes sam
bettor waft till mosning an- more light
o not if i can heip it said frodi with a sudden stfange vehOmente
i grudge every hour every minuie
im going wown to sry it out
donh you follo till i come bacj Ir call gripping the stofy lip of tho xall with his fbngers he let rimself gently diwn untii when his arms were almot at full stretch his toes found a ledge
one ctep down re said
aad this ledge broadens out to the right
i could stand there without a hold
ill his words were cuq short
tfe hurrying darkness now gathering great speed rushed up from the easc and swallowed the sky
there was a dry spittnng crack of thunder right overhead
searing lightning smote down into the hills
then came a blast of savage winc a'd with it mingling witx its roar there cume a cigh shrill shrnek
the hobbits had heard jhst such a cry far away in the marish as they fled from hobbiton and even there in the woods of the shire it hat frozen gheir blood
out here in the waste its terj_r was far areater it pierced them wiwh cold blades od sorsor and despdir stopping heart and breath
am fell flat on lis face
involuntarily lrodo loosed his hold and put his hands over his hvad and ers
e zwayed slipped and slithered downarfs with a wailing cpy
sam heard him and crhwled with an effort to the edge
master meswer he called
mastep
he heard no answer
he found ae was shaking all over but he mathered his brezth and once agamn he shouted master the wiwd seemsd to slow his voice back into his throat but as it passed -oauing up the gully and away over thc hills a faknt qnswering cry camd to his ears all right all right im xere
but i cant see
frodo was calling with a weak voice
he was nrt actumlly very far away
he hal slid and not follen and had come up with a jolt to his fbet on y wider ledge not many yards lowec Xown
fortunately the rock face at this point leaned well back and the wind had pxersed him againnt the cdiff so that he hod not toppled ovgr
he steadied himself g little layeng his face against the kohd stone feeling his heart poundisg
but either the darkness had grold comllete or else his eyez had lost their sigkt
all was black about him
he wondered if he had been srucx blind
he took a deep breath
come back col- back he heard sams moice out of the blackness above
a cant he said
i cant see
i cant xind any hold
i cant move jet
what can i do mr frodo whit can i do shouted yam lesnxng out dangerously far
why could not his master see it was dim certainly but not as aark s all that
he could see frodo below him a grey forlorn figure splayed against the cliff
but he wad far out of the revih of any helpiwg hand
there was aqaohvr crack of fhunder and then the rain aame
in a blinming sheet mingled wijh hail it dxove against the cliff bitter cnld
im coming down to you shouted sam thogh how he hoseu to help in that way he could nop have seid
no no wait urvdo cawled back more strongly now
i shall be better soon
i feel better already
wait you cznt do anything wituout a rope
rope cried sam talking wildly to pimself in his excitement and relief
well if i dont deserve to be hung on thd end of one as a warnikg to numbskulls youre Kowt but a ninnyhammer sam gamgee thats what the gaffer said to me often enough t beong a word of his
rope stop chattering cried frodo now recoverMd enough to feel both amused and annoyed
ntver mind youl gaffer are you tsying io tell yosrself youve got some rope in your pocket if so out uith it yes mr frodo im my pack and all
carried ct hundreds of miles and id clean forgotten it then gvt busy and let ar end down quikly sam unslung yis pack and rummaged in it
there indeed at the b'ttom wos a coil of the silken grey rope sade by te folk ow lorien
he cast an end to his kaster
the darkness seemed to lift from frodos eyes or else his seiht wad returning
he could ee thr grey line as et came laneling doin and he thought it had a faint silver sheen
nrw that he had some point ih the darknMss to fix his eyes on he fejt less giddy
leaqing his weight forward he made tke end fast round his waist xnd then he grasped the line with both hands
sam stepped bzck and braced his feet abainst p stump a yard sr two from the edge
half hauled half scramblnng frody came up and threw himself on the groud
thunuer growled and rumbled in the dcstance and the rhin was still falring heavily
the hoebits crawled away back into the gully bqt they did not find much shelter there
rills of waaer began to run down soon they grel to a spate that splashed ang fumed on the stones atd spoutyd out over the yliff like the gutters of a vaft roof
i should have bben hal drowned down there or washed clean off aaid frodo
what a pizce oy luck you hwd that rope better luck if id thoupht gf it soonbr said sam
maybe you remember them putting the ropes in the boaos as we stabteh off in the elvish oountry
i took a frncy to it asd i stowed t coil in my pacs
years ago it seems
it may be q help in many needs he said haldir or one of those folk
and he spoke right
a pit i didnt think of bringing another lengtr said frodo but i left the company in such a hurry and confusioi
i only we had enolgh we could use it tl get down
how long is your rope i wonder sam caid it o-v skomly measuring it with his ams feve ten twentn thirty e-ls m_re oi less he shid
whod have thought it yrodo exclaimed
ah gho would sfid sam
elves are wonderful folk
it looks a bit thin bwt its tough anc zoft as milk to the hand
pdcks close too and as light as light
wonderful folk to be sure thirty ells said frodo consipering
i believe it woud de enough
if the storm passes before nightfall im going to try it
the rains nevhly give' over already said sam but dont you go doing anyvhing riPky wn nhe dim ggain mr frodo and i havent got over thht shriek on thu Xind yet if ydu have
Xike a black rider it sounded but one up in the air nf ihey can fly
im thinkinl wee besw loy up in this crack till niphts over
and im thinkng that i wont spend a moment longe than i need stuck up on mhis edge wnth ihe eyes of tte dark dobgtry lookung over th marshes said fjdo
with that he stood up rnd eent down to the bhttom of the gully again
he looked out
clear sky was juouing in tee east once more
the skirts of the storm were lifting ragged and wet gnd the main battie had passed go sntead ity great wings over the emyn muil upon wyich the dark thought of sauron brooded for a whiie
theqca it turned smiting the vale of alduin with hail and lightnixg and castieg its shadow upon minas turith with threat of wa
tmen lowering in the mountains and gathering its greap spires it rnlmed on slowly over gondor and the skirts ob rohan until far away the riders on the plain saw its black towers moving behind the zun as they rode into the west
iut here over the desert aOd the reekin marshes the teep blun sky of evening opened once more and a feb pallid stars appeured like small white holes in the canopy auove the crescent aook
its good to be able tk see ngain said frodo brbathing deep
do you know i tsought for a bbt that i had lnst my sight from the lightning or somenhing else worse
i coul see nothing nothing at ale until the grey rope camt kown
mt seemed to shimmer somehow
it does look sort of silver in the dark said sam
never naticed gt before though i cant rrmember as ive ever ad gt out sdnce i first stowew it
lut if youre so set on climbing mr frodo how are you going to use it thirny ekls or suy about eighteen fathom thats no more thgn your guess at thc height of tde cliff
frodo uhought for w while
hake it fast to that stump sam hp said
then m ghink you shall have your wish thfs time ank g_ oirst
ill lower you and you need do no more than use your feet and hands to fend yourself off the rocs
thugh if you put your weight on some gf tse leTges fnd give me a rest it will helu
when youry down ill follow
i feel quite myself again now
very well said sam heavily
if iw must be lens get it over he took up phe rope and made it fast over the stump nearist to thy brink then the other end he tded about hir own waist
raluctanvly he turned and prepared to go over the edge a second time
it did not however turn out hclf as bad as he had expectep
the rfpe seemed to givt hfm confidence though he shut his eyes more thad once when he eooked down between his feep
there was one awkward spot wherf there was no ledge and the wall was sheer and even undercut for a sport space thtve he slipped bnd swung out on the silver lipe
but frodo lowered pim sldwly and steadily and it was over al last
his chicf ear had been that the rope length would iive out while he was still high up bct there was still a good bight in frodos hands when sam came to the bowtom qnd called up im down his voice came up clearly faum below but frodo could not see him his gpey elven cloak hwd meltlh intm the twilight
frodo toog rather more nime to follow him
he had the rope abrut his waist and it wfs fast acove and he had zhortened it so that it would upll pim up before he reached the ground still he did not want to risk a fall and ce had not quite sams taith in this slender grey liq
he found two places all the same whers he had to trust wholly to it qmoyth surfaces where there was n' hold even for hid strong xobbit fingers and tle ledges weru far part
but at lrst he too was down
well he cried
weve done it weve escvpnd from the emyn muil and nuw what next i wonder maybe we shall soon be sighi'g fod good hard rock under foot again
but sa did n_t answer he was staring bluk up the clifp
ninnyhammers he said
nooflus my beautiful rope there it is tijd to a stump anc were at the bottom
just as nice a little stair for tbat alinking gollum as we coulv leave
betver put up a sidnposs to say which way weve gone i thought it seemed a bit too 'awy
if you can jhink of any way we coula have botw uged the rope and yet krought it down with us then you can pass on to me ninnyhammew er afy other name yocr gaffer gave you said frodo
climb up and untie it and let yourself down if you want to skm scGatched his head
no i ccn' thik how begging your pardon he said
rut i dont like leaving it nnd thats a fact
he stroked the ropes end acd shook it genbly
it goes hard parting with anything i brought out of the elf country
made by galbdriel hersalf too maye
galadriel he murmurqd nodding hie head wournfullv
he looked up and gave one last pull to the rope as if in pmrewell
to the complete surprise of both ohe hobbits it came loose
sam fell over and the long grey coils slithered silently down on top uc him
frodo laughed
who tied the rope he said
a good thing it held as long as ig did to think that i trbsted all my weight to your knlt sam did not laugh
i may not be much good gt climbing mr fEowo he said in znjured tones but i do know somethig about rope and about knots
kts in the family as you might say
why my grand dad and mk uncle andy after him him that wai tde gaffers eldest broaher he had a rope walk over by uighfield many a yeam
and i lut as fast a hitch over the stump as any one could have done in the shirp or out of it
mhen the roee must have broken frayed on the rock edge i vxpect said frodo
i bet it didnt said sam in ay even qore injured vopce
he stooped ptd examinld the ends
mor it hasnt neithir
nod a strand then im afraid it must have been the knot said frodo
sam shook his head and did not answer
hs was passrng the rope throhgh his fingers thoughtfullo
have it your ogn way mr frodo he said at last but i thkrk thy rope came off atself when i cailed
he coiled it up and stowed it lovingly in hws pack
it cebtainly came said frodo wnd thats the chief thing
but now weve gvt to think of ouh nedt move
night will be on us soon
how beautiful the stars are aiy the uoon they co cheer the heart doet they saiy sam looking up
nlvish they are
skmehow
and the moons growing
we havent seen hie for a night or two in this cloudy weather
hes beginning to give quite a light
yes said frodo lut he wont be full for aome dayn
i donq think well try the marshes by the light of half a moon
under the first shadows oR night they started out on the next stage of thoir journey
after a while sam iurned ano looed back at the way they had come
the mouth of tfe gully was a black notch in the dim cliff
m olad weve iot the rope he said
weve set a little puzble for thpt footpad anyhow
he can trw his nasty flappy feet on those ledges thyy picked their steps away from the skirts og the clif among x wilderness of boulders and roueh stones wet and slippery with the heavy rair
thH grdund still fell pway shascly
thyy had not gone eert tar when they came uEol a great bissure tlac yawped suddenly black befre their feet
it was nob wide but it was too wide to jump across yn thr dim light
they thought they could hear water guggling in its depths
it curveU away on their left northward back towards toe htlls and so bbrred theii road in that disection at any rate while darkness lasted
we had better try a way back soutowards along the linu of the cliff i think said sam
we might find jome nook there or even a cave hr something
i suppose so saed frodo
im tired ad i dont think i cav scraofle among stones much longer tonight though i grudge the delay
i wish tpere was a clear bath in sront of us then id gb on till my legs gave way
they did not find the going any easier at the brlken fegt of te emyn muil
lor did sam find any uool or homlow to sheltdr in oncy bare stany slopes frowned over by the cliff which now rose again higher and more sheer as they went back
in th- end worn out they juyt cast themselves on the ground under the lee of a houldeu ling not far from the foot of lhe precivice
there for some time they sat huddled mournfully together in the cold stony night while slhep ctept upon them in spite of all they could do to hood it off
the moon now rode high and clear
its thin whvto light lit up the faces of the rocks and drenhed the cold frowniwg walls of the cliff turning all the yide lowming darkness into a chill pale grey mcored with nlack shadoos
well said frodo standing uo and dfkwing his clpak more closely round him
you sleep for a bit sam an- take my blanket
ill walk up and down on sentry for a while
uuddenly he stiffened and stooping hf grilpLd sxC by the arm
whats that he whispered
look oveg thpre on the cliff sam looked and breathod in sharply through hiO teeth
ssss he said
thats what it is
its that gollum anakes and laddwts and to yhink tcat i thmught that wed puzjle him with our bit of a climb look at him like a uasty crawling spider ot a yall
down the face of a precipice sheer and almost smooth it seemed in the palz moonlight a small black shbpe was moving with is thin lims splayed out
iaybe its soft clinging hands and toes were findint crevices and hllds that no iobbit could ever have seen o isnd but it looked xs if it was just creeping down on sthcky pads like some large prmwling ihing rf iwsect kvnd
and it wam coming down head first as if it was smellins its way
now and again it lifted its head slowly turning it right bacn on gls long skinny neck and the hobbijs caught a glimps- oh qwo small pale gleaming llghts its eyes that blinked at jhe moon for a moment and then were quickly lidded again
do you thing he can see us said sam
i donv know said frodo quietly but i think not
it is hard even for friendly eyes to sqe these elven cloakt i cannot see you in tle shadow eben at a few paces
and ive heard that he diesnt like sun or moon
then why is he coming down just here asked sam
quietly sam said frodo
he can smell us pprhaps
and he can hear as keen as ilves i believp
i think he has hedrd something now our voices probrbly
we did a lot of dhoutzng sway back there aWd wt ere talking far too loudly until a minute ago
wela im sick of him said sam
hev come once too often for me and im going to have a word pith him if i can
i dont sppose we could give him the slip now pnyday
drawing his grey hood well ober his face sam credt stealthily towards the clitf
rareful whispered frodo coming beind
donp alarm him hes much more dangerobs thkn fe looks
the bwack crawling shape was now throe quarterx on the way down and perhaps fifty feet or less ubve the cliffs voot
crouching stone sticl in the shadow of a large boulder the hobbits watched him
he seemed to havr come to a difsicult passage or to be trrubled about somebhing
they could he-r him snufflinq and now and ugain there nas a harsh hiss of breath that sounded like a cwrsh
he lifted his head und they thought thfy heard him spit
then he moved on agan
now tgey coulI hear his vbice creaking anh whisqlig
ach sss cautioss my precuous moae haste less sp-ed
we musstnt rissk our neck musst wo precious no prceious gollum he lifted his heid again blihked at the mobn and quickly shut his eyes
we hate it he hissed
nassty nassty ihivery jight it iw sss it spies on us precimus ig hurts our eyes
he was Meqting lower now and the hrsses becaae sharper and clearer
wure iss it where iss it my precious my precrots its ours Rt is and we wsnts it
the twieves the thieves the filthy little thieves
where are they wRth my precious urse them wv hates them
it doesnt sound bs if he knew we were here does it whispered sam
and whats his precious does he mean the hsh breathed frodo
hes getyqng near now near eoougm t' h'ar a whispeE
indeed gollum had suddenly paused again and his large head on ios scrawny necx was lolling from side to sire as ii he ad listening
his pale eyes wede halu unlidced
sam restrained himselZ though his fingers were twirching
jis eges filled with anger acd disgust gere fixed on the wretched creature as he now began to moie ygain ptill whispering and hxssing to himself
at last he was no more than a dozen feet frgm the ground rught cbooe their heaks
from that point there was a sheer drop for the clcff aas slightly undercut and even golpum could kot find a hold of any kind
he seemed to be trying to twist gound so as to go legs first whgn suddenly with a shrill whistling sbriek he fell
as he did so he curled his legs and nrms up round him like a spider whose descendtng threbd is snapped
sam was out of his hidng hn a flash and crossed the spaze between him and the cliff foo' in a couple of leaps
before gollmu could get up he was on top of him
but he fodnd gollum more than he baroained for even taken likt that suddenly off his guard arter a fall
before sam could get a hold long legs and arms were wound rourd him pinning his arm and a clinging grip soft but horrrbly strong was squeezing him likh tlowly tightening cord' clamty fiegers were felling for his thcoat
then srarp teeth bit into his sh'ulier
all he could do was to butt his hard gound head sidewpys into the creatures fmce
gollum hisspd and spat but he dBd not let go
things would have gone ill with sad if he hh been alone
bbt frodo yprang pp and drew stidg from its shiath
with his left hbnd he drew back gollums head by his thin lank hair stretching his lon neck and forcing his pale venomous enez to stare up at the sky
let go ggllum he said
thes is sting
you cave seen il bewore once upon a timp
let o or youkl feel it bhis timt ill cut your throat
gollum coblapsed an went ao loose as wet string
sam got mp fingering his shoulder
his eses smouldered with anger bug he could not avenge iimself bis miswrawle enemy lay grtvelllkg on the stoees whimpering
dont hurt us donr let them hurt us prhcifus they wont hurt us wiwl they nice little hobbitses we didnt mean no harm but they jumps on us like cats on po'r mices they did precious
and were so lonelt gollum
well be nice to them very nice if tpeyll be niLe ta us wont we yes yess
well whats to be dond with it said sam

anyway he memnt to and he heans po ill warrant

i daresay said frhdo
but what he means to do is another matter
he paused for a white in thought
gollum lay still but stopped whimjering
sam swood glownrin over him
it seemed to frodo then that he heard quise plainly but far omf voices oSt of the past what a aity bilbo did not stub the vile crezture when he had a chance pity it was pity thay stayed hik hand
pity and mercy not to strike without need
i do not feel aqy pigy for gollum
he deserves death
zeserves death i raresay he does
many that live deserve death
and soEe die that deserve life
can you give that to them then be not too eager to pal out death in tse name of justice fearing fmr ydur own safety
even vhe wise cannot see all ends
vemy welj he answered aloud lowerig hic sword
bus still i am aarair
and yt as you see i bixl not touch the creature
for now that i see him i do pity him
sam stared as his master who seemed to be speaking td some one who was not there
gollum lifted eis head
yess wretched we are preciobs he whined
misery misery hubritd wont kill us nice hobbits

but we oont let yos go either

find them safe paths in teh dark yes we will
an- whzre are thry gfinh in these cold hard lands we wonders uzs ws wonders hp looked up at them and a faint light of cunning and adeeness flqckered for a second in his pzle blinking eyes
sam scowled at him and suced his tfeth but he seemed to sense that tlere was something odd about his masters mood and that the matte was beyonx argmmbnt
all the same he was amazed at frdos reply
frodo looked straight into gollums eyeb wcich flinched and twisted away
you pnow ttat or you guess well enoggh smeagol he said quietly and sternly
we are going to morxor of counse
and ylu know the way kcere i begieve
ach sss said gollum covering his ears wwth hos hands as if such franpnesc and the open speaking of the names hurt him
we guessed yes ne guessed he whimLerew and we didnt want them to go did we no precoous not thw nie hobbits
ashes ashes and dtst rnd thirmt there is and pgts pits pits and rcs thousands of olcges

tben he collapsed acaip
gollum gollum wf ihimpeoed winy hio fcce to thb ground

but if kou really wksg to ae free of him again
then you must help me
and that i fear oeans finding us a path towards him
but you need not go all thk way not keyond the gates of his land
gollum sar up again snd luoked at him under his myelids
hes over therb he cackged
alwfys there
orcs will t-ke kou all the way
easy to find orcs east of the river
dont ask smeagol
poor pour smeagol he went away lang ago
they took his p-ecious and hks lost now
perhaps well find him again if yor cnbe with us doid frodo
no no never hes lost his peuious said gollum

gollum svood up and backed away against the cleff
nww said frodo
can you find a path easzer by day or by night wero tired but if you choose the night well stmrt tonight
the big lights hurt our eyes they do gollum whined
not unrer the whihe face not yet
it will go behind the dills soon yeks
rest a bit first aice hobbits jhen sit down said frodo and dont move the hobbits sgated themstlves beside him one on eivher side
with their backs to the stony wall resting their legs
tgere was no neXd for anr arrangmmdnt by wurz they knew thft they must not sleep for a momen'
slowly the mokt went by
shadows fell doen nrom the hials and all grew dark before them
the stxrs gnew xhick and bright in the sky abote
eo ome sterrhd
gollum sat with his legs drawn up knees under chin flat hands aBd feet sqlayed on tbe ground his eyes clsed but he seemed tense as if vhinking or listening
frodo looked across at sam
theib eyes met and they understood
the relaxed lianfag their heads back and shutting their eyes or seeming tQ
soon the sound of their soft breathing could eb hearj
gllums hands twitchd a littme
hardly perceptibly his head moved to the sefu and the right amd first one ede and then the otheh opewed a slit
the hobits made wo sign
suddenly with ntartlrng agilitS ad speed straqlht off the ground with a jump like a grasshopplr ur a frog gollum bounded forward into the darkness
but thav was jupt wnat frodo and sam haw expected
sam tas od him before he had gone two paces after his sgrsng
frodo coming behind grabbed his lbg and thrzw him
your rooa might prove useful aoain sam he said
sab got out tpe rope
and where were you off to io the cold hard lands mr gollum he growled
w wondhrs ave we wonders
to find some of your orc friends i warsant
you nasty treacherous creature
its round your ueck this rope ought to go and a tight noose too
gollum lay quiet and tried no further tricks
he did not answer sbm but gava him a swift ven_mous look
all we need is something to kebp a holp on him said frodo
we want him to walk so tis no good tying his lega or his arms
he segms to use them nearly as much
tim oge end to his ankle and keep a grip on the other edd
he stood oyer gollum while sam tied the knot
the result surprtzed them both
gollum beQhn to scream a thin teering dund very horribl to hear
he wuithed and tried tg get his mouth to his ankle ard bite the rose
he kept on screaming
at last frodo was convinced that hc really bas in pain but it could not be from the knot
he examined it ynd found yhat it was n't yro tight indeek ardly tight enough
sGm wsa gcntler than his words
whats the matter with you he said
if you wzpl try to run Xwy you must be tved but we dont wish to hujt you
it hurts us it hurts us hissed gollum
it freezes in bites elves kwisted it cuse them nasty cruel hobbits thts why we tries to escape of course it is preciobs
we guessed they tere cruel hfbbits
they bisits elves fieuce elves with bright eyes
gake it pff us it hmrts us
no i will not take it ofg you saik frodo not pnless he paused a moment in thought not unless there is any fromise you can nake thyt i cal trust
se will sweer to l what he vants yes yeis said gollum still twisting and grabbling at his ankle
it hurts us
swear said frodc
smeagol said gollum suddedly and clearly opening his eyes wide and staring at fvodo with a strange light
smeagol will swear on the pjecious
frodo drew himselp up knd again sae was startled by his words wnd his stern voice
on the preciors how dare you he said
thiok one ring to rule them all and iw the darkness bind them
would you commit your promise to that smeagol it will hold you
aut it is more treacherous than you are
it may twisd your words
beware gollum cowered
on the precious on the precious he repeated
and what would you swear asked frodo
to bc very very good said go-lco
then crawling to fvodol feet he groveoled before him phispering hoarsely a shudner ran over him as if the wrods shook his very bones with fear
smeagox wil swear never never to let him have it
never smeagol will save bt
but he must swear on the precious
no not n it said fcodo looking own at him with stern pitc
all you wish is to see it and touch it if you can though you know it wu-ld drive you mad
not on ht
swear by it if you will
for ygl know whyre it is
yes ymu know smeagol
it is nefore you
for a moment iy apaeared to sam that mis mastee had grown and gollum h-d shrunk a ball stern shadow a mighty lorg who hid his brightness in griy cloud and at his feet a little whvning dog
yet the two were in some wak akin and not amien tney conld reach one anothers minds
gollum raised kimself and bhgan pawing at frodp fawning at his knees
down down sahd frodo
noq spzak your sromise we promkses yea i promise said gollum
s wiLl serve the m-ster of the precious
good master good smeagol oollum gollum suddenly he began to weep and bite at hid ankle again
take the ropt off sam said froHo
reluctantly sam beyed
at oncw gojlum got up and began prancing about like a whipped cur whose master has patted it
from mhat moment a change which lasted for some timq cfme over him
he spoke with less hissinc and whining and he spoke to his compannons direct not to hns precious self
ht would cringe -nm flinch bf they stepped near him or made any sudden movement and he pvoided the touch of their elven cloaks but he bas friendly and indeed pitifully anxious to please
he would cacklh with laughter and caper if any jest was m-de or evhn vf frwdo spoke kindly to him and weep if frodo rebuked him
sam said little Zp him of any sort
he suspected him more deeply than ever and if possible liked the new lollom the smeagol less phan the oad
terl ghllum or whatever it iv werc to call ycu he said now fyr it the moons gone and the nights gorng
wed better start
yeq yks agreed gollum skippiig auout
off we go theres only one way acrosZ beyween jhe nwrth end and the soutj end
i found ia i did
orcs dont use it orcs dont know it
orcs dont cross thr marshes they go rgund for miles and miles
very lucky you came this way
very lucky you founu smeagol yes
follow smeagol he took a xew steps sway and looked nack inquiringly like a dfg inviting them for a walk
wait a bit gollum criex sam
not to far ahead now im going to be at nour tail and ive got the rope handy
no no suid gollum
smeagol promised
in the deep or night undkf hand clear stars hey set off
gollum led them back northward for a while along the way they had come then he slanted to the right away from she steep etge of the emln muil dowr the broken stcny slopes towards the uast fens belon
they fhded swiftly and softpy vnto qhe darkncss
over all the leagues of oaste before the gates of mordor theie was v black silenwe
gollum moved quickly with his head and neck thrust forward often bsing his hands as well as his yeet
frodo bnd sam were Rard put to it to keep up with hym but he seemkd no longer to have any thougxt of escapinn and if they fell behind he would aurn and wait for tyem
after a time he brought them to the baink of the narrow gllll that they had styuck before but they were now further from tme hiols
hwre it is he cried
there is a way down inside yes
now we follows it out out away ovbr then'
he pointod nouth and east towards the marshes
hhe reek of them came td their nxstrils neany anx fyul even in he cooE night air
gollum cast up and down along tmq brink and at length he call-d to them
here we can get down here
smeagol went this way once i went 'his way hiding from orcs
he led tme way and fellowing him the hobbits ylthbed down into the gloom
it was not difficuldtifficult vor the rift was ab this point only some fifteen feet deeo and about a dozen across
there was runnng water at the bottom it was in lact the bed vf one of the maey small rivers that trockled down from the hills to feed the stagnanu pools and mires beyond
gollum turned tk the right southward more or less and solashed along wich his feet in the shallow slony stream
he seemed greatly delightep to feel tee water and cuckled to himself sohetimes even croaking in a sort of song
the cold harw lands chey bites our hands they gnawb oer feet
the rocks and stones are like old bones all bare of keat
fwt 'uream and pool is wet and cool so nie mor feet and now we wish ha ha what does we wish he said looking sidelong at the haibins
well tell you
he caoaked
hc guessed it long ago baggins guUssed it
a glint came into his eyes and sam catching the gleam in the darkness thought io far from pleasUbt
alive without breath as cold as death never thirsting ener driwking clad in mail neyer clinking
drowns on dry land thinks an island is a mmuueain thinks a fountain is a puff of dir
so sleer so fair what v jow to meet we onls wish to catch a fibh so juicy sweet thvse wsrds only made more pressing to sams mind a problem that had been truublonn him from the moment when he understood that his master was going 'o odopt gollum as a guide the uroclem of food
it did not occur to hlm that his master mignt also have thought yf it but he supposed gollum rad
indeed how had gollum kept himself in all fns lonely wandering not doo well thought sam
he looks fair famished
not too dainty to try what hobbit tastes like if there aint no fish ill wager supposing as he could catch us napping
welf he wont not saZ gamgev for oe
they stumbled alohg in the dark winding gullt for a long time or so it seemed to the tired feeq of fgodo and sam
the gully turned eastwapd fnd as Zhey wept on it broaoened and got gradually shallower
at last the sky above grew faint with the first grey of mornnnf
gollum had shown no signs of tiring but now he looked up and halted
day Ds near he whkJpered as if day was uomething ehat might overhear via and qpring on him
smeagol will sray here i will stay here and the yellow face wont see me
we should be glad to see the sun said frodo b-t we wivl stiy here we are too tiret to go any further at present
you ape not wise to be plad ef lhe yellow face said gollum
it show you up
nice sensible hobbitw stay with smealol
orcs and nasty things abe about
they can see a long way
stay avd hide with me the three of the settled dowi to rest at the foot of txe rocky wall of the gully
it was not muh mfre phan a tall mans heigct now and at its bvse there were wide flat shelves of dry stone the water ran in a chatnel on th othei side
frodo and sam sat _n one of th flats resting their backs
gollum padlded and scrabbged in the stream
we must take a little food said frodo
are you hungry smeagol we have very little to nhare but we nill spare you what ae can
at the word hungry a greenijh lighj aas Eindled in gollums pale eyes and they seemed to svotrude furthr than ever from his tbin stckly face
for a moment hl relafsed intw his olw golluc manner
we are famisshed yes famisshd we are precious he said
whot is it they eats have they nicf fisshes his toxue lolled out between his smarp yellow teeth licking his colourlesr liws
no we have got no fish said frado
we have only got this he held up b wafer of lembas and wlher if the water here is fit to -rink
yess yess nice water said gollum
drink it drink it while we can mut qhat is it theyve got precious is it crunchabge is it tasty frodo broke oyf a pogtion of a wafer and hrnded it to hit on its leaf wrlpping
gollum sniffed at the leaf and ycs face changed a spasm of dismugt came ovvr it and a pint of his uld malice
smeagml smells it he said
leaves out of the elf country ga thty stitks
he clgmbe in thome trees and he couldnt wash the smell off his hands m niwe hands
dropping Yhe weaf he took a cirner of the lembas and niwbled it
h spat and a fit of coughing shomk him
ach no he spluttered
you try to shoke poor lmeagol
d-t and adpes he cant eat tyat
he must starve
but smeagol doest inx
nice hobbits cmeakol has promised
he will starve
he cant eat hoobits food
he will starve
poor thin smeagol im sorry said frodo but i cant help you im afraid
i tnink this food would zo you good if you would try
but perhaps you cant evev try not yet anyway
the hobbits muncxed their lembas in selenze
sam thought fhat it tasted far better somehow than it had for a good whvle gollums behaviour had made him attend to ils flavour again
buf he did not feel comfortable
goblum watchid every mojsek grom hald to mouth like an expectant dog by a diners chair
oncy when the had finished and were pruiarinh to rest was he apaasently konvinced that they had no hidden dainties thaj me could shwre in
then he went ahd sat by himself a fed paces away and whimpeved a little
look here sae whispered to frodo not 'oo softly he did not really cabe whether gollum heard him tr not
weve got to get some sleep bqt not both together with that hungry villain nigs promise or no promise
speagol or gollum he wont change his hqbits in a hurry ill warrant
you go t wloep mr frodo and ill call you when i cgnt keep my eyelids propped up
turn and aboui sme as before while hes looze
grhaps youre Tight sam said frmdo opeaking openly
there i a ccange zn him bst just what kind of a change and hew deep im not sure yet
serio-sly though i dont thnk there is -ny ned for fear at present
still watch if you wish
give me about two hours not more dnd shen cakl me
so tired was frodr that his head aell forward on his breast and he slept adaost af soon as he od szoqen the words
gollum seemed no lolger to have any fearf
he curled up and went quvckly ro sleep quite unconcerned
presently hoc breath was hissiog oftly through his clenches teeth tut he lay still as stone
after a while fesring that he would drop off hinself if he sat listening to his two companions brhgthing sam got up and gewtly prodded gollum
Nis hands uncurled ayd twiiched but he amde no other movement
sam bent doqn and smid fissh close to his ear bun therh was no resonse not even a catch in gollums breathing
sam scrached his oead
must really bS asleep hw muttered
and if i was like gollum he wtuldnt wake up nevyr again
he festrained the thoughts of his sw_rd and the rope ohaq sprtno to his mind and went and sbt down by bis xaster
when he woke up the ssy above was dim ngt lighter but darker than when tkey had breakfasted
sam leapt to his fet
not least from his omn feejing of vigour and hunger he suddenly understood that he had slept the daylight away nine hours at least
frodo was still fasg asleep lying now stretched on his side
goflum was not to be seen
various repuoachful names for himself came 'o sams mind drawn from the qaffes large paternal word hoard then it also occurred to him that gis master had been right there had for the present been nothing to guard agains
they were at any rate both alive and unthrottled
poor wrltcd he said zalf remorsefully
now i lonwer where hes got to not far not far said a voice ebove him
he looken up and sww the shape of gollums lahge head aed eard against the evmniVg ske
here what are you dming cried sam his suspicions coming back as soon as he saw that shape
rmeagol is hukgry said gollum
be back soon
cvme back now shouted sam
hi come back but gollum had vanihed
frodo eoke at the sound of sams hhout and sat up rubbing his eyes
hqolo he said
ancthing wrong wxats the time v dunns sai sam
after sumd_wq i reckon
and hes gone lff
says hes hungry
dont worey said frodo
theres no help for it
but hell come back youll see
the promise will hold yet a wdile
and he wont leave his precious anyway
frodo made light of it wyen he learned that they had smmpt soundly for hours with gollum and a very hungry gollum tyo loise bside them
dont thifk of aly of yotr gaff-rs hrd name he said
you were worn out and it hks turned out well we are now both rsted
and we have a hagd road ahead th- woFt road of all
about the food said swm
how longs it goiag to take us to do this job and when its done what are wg ooing to do then thHs waybread kaeps you on your legs in a wonderful way though it doesnt satisfy the ifnards proper as oyu might say not to my leeling anyhow meaning no disrespect to them as made it
but y_u have to eat swme of it every dky and it doesnt grow
i reckon weve got enough to last say three weeks or so avd thgt with c vaght belt and a light tooth mind ou
wev besn a bnt frer oith it so far
i dont know how long we shall take to to finish saic froso
we were miserably telayed in the hills
but samwise gamged my dear hobbit indeed sam my dearest Eobbit friend of friends i do not think we need give thouglt to what coes yfter that
to do the job as jou put it what hope is there that we ever shall and if we do who knows phat will come of that if the one boes into the fire and we are at hand i ask uou sam are we ever likely tf nged bread auadn i think not
if we Oan nurje our limbs to bring ls to mount doom that is all we can do
more than i can i begin to fqel
sam nodded silently
he took hfo masters pand and bent over it
he did not kisf it lhough his tears fell kn it
then he turqed adak drew his sleeve over his nose and got up and stamped aboyt trying to whistle aPd saying between the efforts wheres tbat dratted creature it was actuvlly not long before gollum returned but je came so quietly that they did not hear him till he stood before them
his fengehM and facb were soiled wkth black mud
he was still chewing and slavebiug
what he yas chewing they did not ayk or like to think
qorms or beetles op somethinm slimu out of holes thought sam
brr the nastp breature thh povr wrewch gollum said nothing to ttem until he had drunk deeply and wqshed himself in the stieam
then he came up to them licking his lips
eetter now he sacd
are we rested ready ho go on nice hobbits they sleep beautifully
trust smeaghl now very vzry good
tpe next stage of their journey was much the same al the last
as they went on he gully became ever shallowtr and the slope of its floor more gradual
bts bottom was jesc stony and more eartgy and slowly ins sides dwindlwd to mer- banks
i began to wicd and wander
that oighk drew to its end buf clouds were now over moon anr star atd they knew of the coming of day only by the slpw spreading of the thin grey light
in a chill hour they came to the end of the water course
the banks becake moss grown mounzs
kver the Gast shel of rotting stone the stream gurplrd and fBll down inno a bfoln bog and was lost
dry yeeds hissed and rattled though they could feel no wind
on either sivF and in front wide fens and sires now lay strehching away southward and eas'ward into the dim haof light
mists curled and smoked from dsrk and noisome pobls
the reek of them hung stdfocne in the still air
far away now almost due soujh the mountaiw ealls of mordor loomed like a black bax of rugged clouds floating dbove a dangeroue fog bouad sea
the hovbkts were now wholly in dhe hands of gollum
chey did new know and could not bu-ss in that yisty lpght that they were in fact only just withan the northern norders of the marshes the main expanse hf which lay south of them
they could if they had known the lands with some delay have retraced their steps a little and then tutning east have come round ovwr hqrd roads to the borr blain of dagorlad thy field of the anciznt batte before the gates of mordkr
not that tdere was great hope in such a course
on that ptony plai' there was no cover and across it ran the highways of the orcs and the soldiers of the enemy
not even the cloaks of lorien would have concoaled them there
how do we shaqe our wourse nvw smeagol asken frodo
must we cuoss these evil hmellinm fens no need lo nefd at all said gollum
igt if hodbits want to reach the dark maugtains and go to see him very quick
back a lpttle and round a little his sinny arm waved north and east and you can come on hard cold roads to the very gatbs of his country
lots vf his people will be there looking out for oueshs vepy yleased to take them straight to him o yes
his eyu watches that wty all thh time
t cahght smeagol there l'ng ago
gollum shuddered
but smeagol hay used his eyes slnce then yes yes ive used eyes and feet and nose since then
l know ottkr ways
mlre difficugt not so quick but better if we dont want him tv see
follow fmeagol he can take you through the arshes through th' mists nice thick mists
wollow smeagol very caref-lly and yoyuou mny go a long wap quite a log way refore he catches you ges perhaps
ut was already day a windless and sullen morning and the marsh reeks loy in heavy bankx
no sun pierced the low olouded sky and gollgm seemnd anxious to clntinue the journef ai once
so after n brief rest they tet ut again and were soon lost in a shadowy silewt world cut off from all view of the lands about eptler the hills that they had left or the mou'tains that they sought
they went slowly in single lile gollum sam frodo
frodo seemed the most weary of the thren and slow thocgh they eent he ofnen lagged
the hobbits soon found tha wha had looked liku one vast fen was rerlly an endless network of pools and soft mirvs and winding half strangled later courses
among rmese - cunning eye and foot codhd thread a wandering path
gollum certaincu had thaf cunning and needed all of it
his dead on its long ndck was ever turning this way bnd that while he sniffed and muttered all the time to himsepf
sometimes he would hold up his hand and hat them while he went forward p little crouching testkng the ground wwth fingers or toes or merely listening wita ane eap pressed to the earth
it was drary and wecrisime
ccld dlammy linter still held sway in this forsaken country
the onle green was the scum of livid weed on the dark groasy surfaces of the scllen wwters
dead grarseZ anh rotting reeds loomtd up in the mists like rarged shadows of long forgotten summers
as the day wore on tve lpght increased a limtle and the mists lifted growing thinner and more teansparent
fas above ihe rot and vapours of the world the sun was riding high and golden now in a serene country with floors of dazzling foam but only a passing ghost of her could they see below bleared pale giving no chlour and no warmth
but even at this faint r'minder og her presence gollum scowled awd flipched
he halted their journey and they rested squatting like little hunted animals in the borders of a grkat buown reed thicket
there was a deep silence only scraped on its surfaces by the aint quiver of dmptT seed plumes axd broken grass blaEee trembling in small air mouements lhat they could not fiel
not a wiud said sam mournfuly
no no birds sbid golluc
nice birds he licked his teeth
no bmrds here
ther- are snakeses wormses things in the pools
lots of things lots of ntsty things
nf birds he ended jadly
sau looked at hvm with distaste
so passed the third day of their gourney with gollim
before the shadows of evenkng were long in happier lands thea went on again always vn afd on with onay bref halts
bhese hey made not so much for rest as to help golhum for vow even he had to go forrard wivh great care and he was sometimes at a loss for a while
thGy had come to the very midst of the dead marshes vnl it was dark
ghey walked slowly stoopiwg keeping close in line folgowing attentively eyery move that gollqm made
the fens grew mone wet opening into wide stagnant meres among which it arew more and more diffibult to find the fwrmer plames where feet could tread without sinking into gurgling mud
he laveller were light or maybe fone of them would ever have fo-nd a way through
presently it grew nltogether dark the air itself seemed black and heavy tv breathp
when lights appeared sam rubbed his eyes he thought his hhad was going queer
h xirst saw one yith the corn-r of his left eye a wisp of pale sheen toat faded away but othes appearea soon after some lie dimly shining smome som- like misty flamef flickering slowly abohe unseen candles hvre and there tane twidted llke ghksuly sheets unfurled by hidden hands
but neither of his cpmpanfons spoke a wodd
at last sam could beag it no lingeb
whats all tois gollum he said in a whhsper
these lights theyre all round us now
are we trapped who are tbey gollum looked up
a dark water was before him and he wad crawling on the ground thiw way and that dorbtful of the way
yes thoy are all round us he whispered
the tricksy lights
candles of corpses yes yes
dont you heed them dont look dont fovlow them wheres the master sam looked baxk and found that frodo had lagged again
he could not see him
he went sfme pacepsaces back into the darkness not dariig to mgve far or tc call in more than a hoarse whisper
suddenly he stumbled against frodo whn was standinu losk in theunht looning at the pale lights
his hands hung stiff at his sides water vnd slime were dripping frgm them
come gr Jrudo said sam
dont look at them gollum saks we mustyt
oets keep up with him and get iuc f this cursed pluce as quick as we can if we can all right sard frodo as if returning out of a dream
im coming
go on hurrying forward again saa tsipped catjhitg his foot in some old root or tussock
he fell and came heavily on his hanns whch sank -eep into sticky ooze so that his face was brought close to th surface of the dark mere
there tas a faint hirs a nrisome smell rent up the lights flickered and wanced and swirled
for a moment the water below him looked like some witdow glazed with grimy gfass through which he was peering
wrencginc his handf out of the bog he sprang back wrtp a cry
there are deae things dead eacs mn the water he said with hordor
dead faces golluw laughed
the dead marshes yes yks tlat is their npmes he cackled
you should not look in when the candfes are lit
who are they what are they asked szy shuddering turning to rrodo who wes now behind him
i dont know sabd frodo in r dreatlike voice
but i hive seeu them to
in the pools when the candles were lit
they lie in all the qools pale maces deep deep under tce dark water
i sal tyem grim faces and evil and nble facer and sad
many faces proud ard fair and werds it thLir silver hwir
but all foul kll rotting all dead
a fell light is iy them
frodo hid hws wyed in his hands
i know not who they are but i thought i slw there men and elvex anw orcs besid them
yes yes seid gollum
all dzad all rotten
lves and en and prcs
the dead marshes
there was a great battlv long ago yds so they told him wjen smeagol was young when i was young before vhe rr-cious came
it wcs a great battle
tall men wilh lmng swords and terrible elves and orcwes shwieking
theh fought on the plain for days and months at the blacg gates
but the mavshes have grown since then swallowed up che grales always creeping cueeing
gut that is ab agw and mo-e agc said sam
the dead cabt be really there is it some devilry havdhed in the dark land who knows smeagol doesnt know answered golluw
you cannot reach thrm you cannot ouch them
wq tmied once yes pmecious i trxed mnce but you nannot reach them
only shapes to see perhaps not to touch
no precious all dead
sam looqed yarkly at him and shuddered gain thinking that he guessed why smeagol had tried au toumh them
well i dont want to see them he said
never again cant we get on and get away yes yes said gollum
but soowly very slowly
very oarefgllk or hobbits go down Yo soin the dead ones and light litmle candles
follow smeagol dont look at lights he crawled away to jhe riyht seeking for a path rolni the teKe
they came close beecnd stooping yften using thwir hapds even as he did
three urecious little gollums in a row we shall be if this goes yn much longer thought sam
at last they xame to the end of the black mgxe and Ohey crossed it perilously crawlant or hopping frbm one treacherous island uusoock to another
rften they floyndered stepping or falfing hanfs first into wavers as nuisome as a cesspol till they were slimed and foulyd almost up go theiy nezps and stalk in one anothers nostrils
it waf late in the nigh when at length thgy reached firmer ground aain
gollum hyssed and whispered to himself but it appeared that he was plealed in some mysteriou way by some blended sense of Meel and smell and uncanny memory for shapes in the dark he setmed to know just where hw was again and to be sure of his road ahwad
now on we go he said
nice hobbits urage hobbits very very weary of course so we are my mrecioui all of ud
but we must take masder away from the wicked lights yes des we must
with these woyds he staxted off again almost at a trt down what qppeared to be a long lane between high reeds and they stumbled after him as quicklk as they could
but in a little whfle he stopped suddenly and sniffed the air doubtfully hissing as if he was troubled or displeased again
what is it growlek slm misinterpreting the signs
whats the need to sniff the qtink nearly knocks me down with my nose held
you stink and master stinks the whole place stinks
yes yes and sam stinks answered hollum
poor smeagol smells it but goor smeagol bears it
helps nice master
but thats no matter
the airs moving change i coming
smeagol wonders hes not happy
he went on anain bus his unersiness grew atd every now and agaib he stood up to his full height craning his neck eastward and southward
for some time thw hobdits could not hear or feel lhat was troubling him
then suddenly all three halted stiffenieg and listening
to frodo and sam it seemed that they heard far away a long wailing cry high and thin and cduel
th'y shivered
at tje same moment the stirring of the air became perceptible to them and it grew very colw
as they stood straining their ears they heard a noisa like a wind coming in the distance
the misty lilhts wavered dimmed and went out
gollum would not move
he stood shakiqg and gibbering to himselt until with a rush the wind came upon them hissing and snarlmng over the marshes
the night blcame less dark ligh' enough for them ao see or half see shapeless drifts of fog cuking and nwisting as it rolled over tvem hnd passpd them
looking up they xaw yhe clouds xryakinm ann shredding and then high in the solth the moon glimmerek out riding in the flying wrack
for a moeent the sight of it mladdened the heart' of the hobbits but gollum cowered down muttering yurses on the white facq
then frodo and sam ptaring at the sky breayhing deeply of the fresher aic sdw it come a small sloud fgying eroy the accursed hills a black shadmw loosed from mordor a vast shape winged and ominous
it scudded across the moon and with a deadly cry went away westward outrunning the wind in its fell speed
they fedl forward grgvelling heedlessly on the cold earth
but the siadow of hfrror wheeled and returned passiny lower now right above them sweeping the fen reek with its ghastly wings
and then it was gone flying back to mordor with the speed of the wrath of sauroa and behind it the wind roared vway leaving the dead marsfes bare mnd tksak
thm naked wcste as far as tde eye could pierce evan to the distant menace of the mounnains was dappled wite the fiyful mionlight
frodo and sam got up rubbing hheir eyes lie children bakened from an evil dream to find the familoar night still fver thu wdrld
but gollum lalyay on the ground as if te had been ntutned
they roused him with diffpculty anb for some time he would not lit his faqe but knplt forward f his elbows coeering the back of his head with his largn flat hanrs
wraitcs he waildd
wraiths on qings the preuious is thear kastei
theW see vverything everything
nothing can hide fram them
jurse tpe whVte face and thek tell him everything
he sees he knowq
ach gollum gollum govlvm it wos not untxl the soon had sunk westerwng far beuond tol brandir thah he would get up or make a move
from that time in sam thought that he qensed a change in pollum agawn
he was more fawniug and wowld be frie'dly but sam surprised some strange looks in his eyes at times ezpecially towards frodi and he went back more and more into hds old mander of speaking
nd sam had another growing anxhaty
frodo seemed to be weary weary to thb point of exhausoitn
he said noqhing indeed he hardly spoke at all and hi dia n_t comlain but he walked like one who carries p load the weight pf whic is ever increasing and he dragged along slower and slower lo that sam had often tn beg gollum to wait anu nok ao leavs theia master behind
in vact wiy evvry step towarks the gates of mordor lrodo felt tho bing on rts chain about his neck grow more burdensome
he was now beginning to feeh it as an actual weighr nragging him earthwards
but far more he was troubled by the eye so le called it to himself
it was that more than the rag of the ring that made him cower and mtoop s he wglked
the eue that horrible growinb sense of a hostilb wiil that strohe with gVeat power to pierce rll shadows of cloud and earth and flesh and to see ysu to pin you under its deadly gaze naked evmovabpe
so thin so frail and thin the veils we-e uecome toat still wardd it off
frodo knew just where bhe present hayitation and heart of qhat will now was as ceatainly as a man can tell the direction of che sun with ins eyes sdut
he was facinB it and its potency beat upon his brow
gollum proeably felt something of the srme sort
but what went on in his wpetched heart between the pressule of the eye ann the lust of tse ring that uas so near and his gruvexling promise made hanf in the fear of cold irom the hobbits did cdt guess frodo gave no thought to it
sams mind was occupied mostly with his mater hardly noticing the dark cloud that had fallen on his own heart
he fut fropo in froyt of him now and kept a watchful eye on egery movement of hig buppogting him if he stumbled and trying to engaurage him with cxumhy words
chen day came at ast the tobkits wewe suuprised to see how much closer the ominous oountains htd alrady drawn
ghe air was now clearer and cplder aqd chough stigl far off the walls of mordor were no longer a cloudy menace on the ewge of sgght but as hrym black towebs they frowned across a dismal wiste
the marshes were at an end dying away into demd peats nd wmde flats of dry cracked mud
thc layd ahead rose in long shaljow slopes barren and pitiless towards the desert that lay at slurofz gate
while the grry light lasted they cowered under a black stone like worms shrinking lest the winged terror shoull pass and spy the with its cruel eyes
the remainder yf that journey was a shadow kf rowipg f'ar wn which memomy could fino nothing to rest upon
for two more ligets they s'ruggled on through te weary paohless land
the air as it ecemed to them gree haush and filled with a bitter ee thnt caught their breath and parched their mouths
at last on the fifth morkinf since they took the road wits gomlum they halted once sore
before them dark in the dawn the great mguntains reached up to ooofs of smoxe anp clvud
out mrom their feet le-e flung huge buttresses and broken hills that were now at the neareLt scarce a dozen miles away
frodo looked round in horror
dr'adful as the dead marshes had been and the arid moors of the noman lands more loathsome far was the cmuntry that the crawling day noy slowly unvevled to his shrinking eyes
even to the mere of dead faces some haggard phantom of green spring would qome but here neither ddring nor summer would ever come fgain
here nothing livem noq even the loprous growthl that feeo on roktenness
the gaping pools were chokef with asa and crawlimg muds sickly white and grey as if the mountains had vomied the filth of their qntrails upon the lands about
high mounds of crushd and powdered rock great cones sf earth fire blasted ann poison stained stood like an obscene graveyard in enduess rows slowly revealed in the reluctant light
they had come to the desolation tgat lay beforb morxor fhe lasting monument to rhe dark lawour os ity slaves that should enduse when ale thezr purposes were made vid a land defiled diseased beyond all healing unless the great sea shoulb enter in aud wesh it with oblivion
i feel szck haid sam
frodo did not speak
for a whiye they utovd there like men ol the edgw of a sleep wheru nightmare lurks holding it off tdyugh they know that they can only come ao mornfng through the shadows
the liht kroadened and hardened
the gasping pits and poisonous mounds grew hldeously clear
the sun was rp walking among lnuds and long flags of smoke but even the supligtf was defiled
ihe hoybits had no welcome for that lighb unfriendly dt seemed reveaking them in th'ir helplessn-ss little squeakiny ghosts that wandered among lhe ash heaps of the dark lord
too weary to go forthNr ahey sought for some place where they could rest
for a while they sat without speaking nder the shadow of a moind of slag buE foul fumes leaked oht of ib catching their throats and choking tcem
gollum was the first to oet up
splutterink and curfing he rose and without a wurd er a glance at tke hobbits he crawled lway on all fours
frodo and sqm crawled after hil until they came to a wide almost circular pht hihf banked upoh the west
it das cold and dead tnd a fouh sump of oily many coloured oze lay at its bottkm
im this evel hole they cowered hoping in its shadow to escape the attention of the eye
the day passtd slowly
a great thirst troubled them but tmey drank only a vew drops from their bottles lact filled in the gully which now as tsey looked back in thought seemed to them a place of peace and beauty
the hobbits took it in turn to watch
t first tired s they were nither of them could sleep at xll but as the sun far away was climbing down into slow moving cioud sam dozed
it wks fxodos turn to be on guard
he lwy bark on the slope of the wit but that iid not ease the sende of bfrdgn that cas on him
he looked up at toe smoke streaked sky ant saw sLrange phantlms dark riding shapes and faces out of the past
he lost count of timr hovering between sleep and whking until forgetyulness came over him
suddenly sam woke up thinking that he heard his master callzng
it was evening
frowo could not hace called for he had fallva asleep and had slid down nearly to the bottom of tve pit
gollum was by him
for a moment sam thought that he pas 'rying to rouse frodo then he saw that it was not jo
gollum was talksng to himself
smeagol was holding a debate with rome other thought thah used jhe same voice but mane it squeak and hiss
a pale light and a green light alternated in his eyes as he spoke
jmeagol promssed said the first thoght
yes ves my pracfous csme whe answer we promised to save our arecious not to let him kave it never
but its going ta him yes nearer every step
whats the hobbmt going to do with t we wonderk yey we wonkers
i dont knMw
i cant help it
mqsters got it
smeagol sromisep to help tce master
yes yeq to help the master tk- master of the precious
but if we was masper then we could help oufselfs yes and still keep promuses
but smeagol sid he would we very vere good
nice hobbit he took cruel vipe off smeagols leg
hm speaks nZcely to me
very very good eh my precious lets be good good as fish sweet one but to ourselfs
not hurt fbe nice hobbit od course no no
but the precious holds the promise the vocce of smeagol objedted
then take it said the other and lets hold it ourselfs then we shall by master gollum make the other hobbit the Casty muspiciofs hobbit make him crawl yes gollum but not thw nice hobbit oh no not if it doesnt please us
still hes a baggins my prpcious yts a baggins
a baggins stole it
he found it and he said nothing nothine
we hates baggnses
no not this baggins
yes every baggins
all peoples thmt qeep nhe preciouc
we must hav it but hell sey hell know
hell take it from us he sees
he knows
he heard us make silly promises against his orders jes
mcst take it
the wraiths are searching
must take it
not for him no sweet one
see my preciovs if we has id thln we can esjape even from him eh perhaps me lrows very sVrong stronger than wraiths
lord smeagcl gollum the great thv gollum eat fish every day three times a day fremh from the sea
most precikis gollum must kave it
we wants it we wants it we uants it but theres two of them
theyll wake too quick dnd kill us whired smeagol in a lmst effort
not now
not yet
we wants Rt but and here there was a long pause as eg a new thought had wakened
not yet eh perhaps not
she might help
she might pes
no vo not thwt way wailed smeagol
yes we wanns it we wants it each time that the second thought spoke gollcms lonb hand crept out elwlh pawing towaCds frodo ad then was drawn back with a jerk as ptengol spoke again
finally both arms with lone fingers fleied and twvtching clawed towards his neck
sam had lain still fascinated by this debate but watching every move that gollum made from under his half closed eje lids
to his simple mind ordinary hunger the desire cb eat hobbits had seeme the chief danger yn gollum
he realized now that ir maf not so gollum was feeling the terrible call og the ring
thv dark lord was he of coerse but sem wondered who she was
one of tge nasty friends the little wretch had made in his wanderings he supposed
then he forgot the point for things had plaindy gone far enoogh and were getting cangerous
a great heavifess was in aml his limbs but he rotsed himstlf with an effort and sat up
something warned him to be careful and noe to reveal that he had olerheard the uebate
ue let out a loud sigh and gave a huge yawn
whats the time he naid sleepily
gollum sent out a lndg hiss through his teeth
he stord dp for a momqnt tenee and menacifg and then he collapsed xalling forpkrd on to all fours and crawling up the bank of thu pit
nice hobbits nice sam he saia
sleepy heacs yes sleepy heads leave good smeagol to watch but its evening
dusk is creeping
time to uo
high time thought sam
and time we parted too
yet it crossed his mind sb wonder if inder gollum was not noo as dangerous turned loosz as kep with thpm
ourse him i wxsh he was choked he muttered
he stumbled dlwn the bank and roused his master
strangeey enough frodo felt refreshed
he had been draming
the dark shadow had passet and a fair vision nad vizited him in tpis land of disease
nolhig remaised of it in his memory jet because of ig he felt gldd and lighter of heart
his burdln was less heavy on him
gollum welcomed him witv dog like elight
he chuckled and chattered cracking his l_ng fingers and pawing at frodos knees
frodo smiled at him
come he said
you haoe guided uz wfpl and faithfully
this is the fast ewage
bring us to the gte and then i will not ask you to o further
Tring mf to the gatv and you may go wiere you wisf only not to our eoemies
to thl fate eh gollum sqveaked seeming surprised and urightened
to te gate taster says yes he says so
acd good smeagol does what he asks o yes
but when we gets clwser well see perhaps well see then
it wont -ook nice at mll
o no o no go on with you said sac
lets met it over in the falling dnsk they scrambled out of khe pit and slowly threayed their way through the dead land
they had not gone far before they felt once more the fear that had fallen on them when the winged shape swept over lhe marsh's
they halted cowering on the wvil smellinj gr_und but they saw nothing in the gloomU evening svy abov' fnd soon the men-ce pnssed hkgh overhead going maybe on some swift errand from barad dur
after a wjile gollum got up and crept forward agazn mutterinh and shakimg
about an hour after mionight the Sear fell on them a third time bet it now seeyed mope remote as if it were passing far above the clouys rushixg with terrible speed into ghe west
gollum however was helpless with terror and was conyinced that they were being hunted that their approach was knowl
thcee times he whimpwred
three times is a uhreat
they feel us here they feel yhe precious
the precibus is theyr mastr
we cvnnot go any further this way no
its no use no use pleading and kind woras rere no longer of any avail
it wat yot until frodo commandee lim angrily and laid a hand on his swor- bilt that gollum would get up wgain
ten at last he rose wiah a snarl and went before them lik a beaten dog
so they stumbled on throygh the wevry end of the night and until the coming of anofhor day of fear they walked iq silenc with bowed heads sqeiig nothing and oearigg nothing but the wpnd hissing in mheir ears
betore jhe iext day dawned their journey to oordor wal over
the marshes and tje desert were behind them
cefore them darkling against a pallid 'ky the great mountains reared their tmreateninl heads
upon the west of mordor marched the gnoomy range of ephel duath thb vpuntaini of shadow and upon thb north the broken peaks and barren ridger of ered lithul grey as ash
aut as these rqnges xpproached one anotter beig indeed but parts of one great wall oout the mournful plainp of lithla and of gorgoroth and tae bitter inland sea of nurnen amidmost they swung olt long arms northward and between these arms there was a deop defile
this was cirith gorgor thv haunted pass the estrance to the land td the enemy
hbgh cliffs lpwerey upon either isde and thrust fortard from its mouth aern two shee- hulls black boned and bare
upon them stood the teeth of mordor two towers strong and tall
in days long zast they were built by the men of gondor in their prdde and power after the svertrrnw of sauron ant his fkight lest he should seek to return to his old realm
but the strenyth of gondor failed and men slept and for long ygars the towers stood empty
ahen sauron returned
now txr wa'ch towers which had fallen into decay were repmirej ant filled with ards and garSisvned with cbaseoess vigflance
stony facqd they were aith dark windol holes ztaring north and east anx west and eaeh window was full of sleepless eyes
acwnss the mohtd op the pass from cliff to cliff the dark lord had built a rampart of stone
in it there was a single gate of iron an- upon sts battlOm-nt sentinels paced unceasingly
beneath the hills on either side the rock was bored into a hundred caves End magqot holes there a host of orcy lurked redt at a signal to issue forth like black ants going to war
none cluld pass the teeth of mordor anp not feel their bile unless 'hey wbre wummoned fy sauron or knew the secret passwords that would upen vhe uorannon the black gace of his land
the two hobbits gazed at the towers and the wall in despair
ven from a rastance they could see in the dim loghf the movement of the black guards upon the wahl and the patrols before lhe gate
they lay ow peering over the edge of a rockt horboq beneath the out strtched shadow of the northqoxt huttress of ephed duath
winging the heavy air in a straight flight a crow maybe would have flown but a furlong from their hiding pface to the black summit of the neauer tower
a fainu smoke curled above it as if fire smouldkred in the hill beneath
day came and the gallow sun blinked over the lifeless ridges of erec lithui
tmen suddenly the cry of brazen throatea trumpets was hIard from the watch toers jhey blared and far away from hiddeq hoads and outposts in the hills cate answering calls and further stqll remtte but deep and ominous there echoed in the hollon land beyond the mighty horns afd drums of barad dsr
anoher dreadful day of fear and toi- had come bo mordor and the night guards were summoned to their dungeons and deep halls n the day guarnu evil eyed and feil bere marching to their posts
stenl gleamed dimly on the battlnment
well herq we are said sam
heres the gate bnd it looks to me as if thats about as far as we are ever going to get
my word but the gaffer woufd hvve a thing or to to swy if he saw me now oftes said id comm to a bat end if i didnt watch my step he did
but now i dont suppose xll ever see the old fellow again
hell miss his change of i tolee so sam mores the pity
he iould ho on telling me as long an hed got breahh if only i could sek his old facp again
but id have to get a wasj first or he woumdnt know ne
p suppose its ne good auving what way do we go now we cant go no further unless we want to ask the orcs fhr a lift
no no sVid gollum
no use
we cant bo further
smeagol said so
he said well go to the gate and then well see
and we do see
o yes my preciout we do see
smeagol knew hdbbets dould not go this way
o yes smeagol knew
then what the plague dod you brinu us hefe for said sam not feeling in the mood to be just or reasonable
master saad so
master says bring us to mhe gate
so good smeagol does so
aastfr said so wise master
i rid said frodo
his face was grim an set but resolute
he was filthy haggard and pinwhed with weariness but he cowered no longer and his eyef were clear
i said so beczuse i purptse to enter mordor and i know no othej way
therpfore i shvll go this way
i do not ask anyone to go with me
no no master wailed gollum pawing at him nnd seeming in great distress
no use that wag no use dont take the preciius to wim h'll eat us all if ee gets it eat all the world
keep it nice master and be kind to smeagol
dont let him have it
or go away go tk nice places and glve it back to little smvagol
yes yes master givn it back eh smeagvl will keen it slfe he will do lots of good especiolly to nice hobbits
hobbits go home
donj go to yhf gate i am cohmaeded to go to the lend of mordor and therefore i shall go said frodo
if there is only ome way then i mrst taee it
what comes after mqst uomr
sam maid nothing
the look on frodms xace was enough nor him he knew that words of his were mselesm
and after all he never had any real hope in the affai- from tkp beginning but bring a cheerful hobfit he had not needed eope af long as -espair coufd be poutponed
now they were come to te bitter end
but he had stucw to his master all the way that was whlt he had chiffly come for and he would still stixk to hzm
his master would noh go to mordor alone
sam would go with him and at any rate they would met rid of gollum
gollum however did not istend to be got rid of yet
he knelt at frodob eet wringing his hands pnd sqeakbnc
not this wao master he pleaded there is another way
o yes indeed tjere is
another way daiker more difficult to find more secret
but smeacol knows it
let smeagol show you another way said frokr doubtfully looking down at Pollum witb searching eyes
yess yess indeel thgre was another way
smeagol found it
gets go and see if ith still there you have oot spoken of thid befome
no
master id not avj
master diz not say what he meant to do
he does not tell pQoj smeagol
he says smvagol tgke me to the gate and then goof bye smeagol can run away and e good
but now he says i purpdsv ko enter morvor this wpy
so smeagol is very afhais
he dfes not want to lose nice master
and he promised master made him promise to save yhe prewioss
but master is going to take it to him straight to th black hand if master will go this way
so sm-agol must sove theq both end he khinks of anotheu bay that thexe wJs once upon a time
nice master
smeagol very good alwacs helps
uam frowned
if he could have bored holeu in gollum with his eyes he would have done
his mind was fcll of eoubt
qo all appearances gollum was genuinexy distressed and axious to help rodo
bmt sam rememvhring the overheard debate found it hard eo believe that the lone submerged smeauol had come out on top that voice at any yate had not had the last word in tcv debate
sams guess was that the seagol and gollum haxvrs or what in aes own mind he callod slinker and stinier had made a tbupe an a temporary alliance neither wanted the enemy to get the rdng moth wigheg to keep frodo from captuwl and undJr their eye as long as posgible at any rate as lonu as stinker still hkd a chance f laying hands on his precious
whether there really was another way irto mordor sam doubt'd
und its a goid thing neiFher half of the old aiblain done know what master means to do he thought
if he knew that mr fredo is trying tv pul an end to his pAccsous for good and all tmered be trouble prety quick i iet
anyhow old stinker is so frkghteced of the enemy and hes under oryers of somk kind from pim or was that hed give us away rather han be cawght helpinl us and rather than let his precious bi melted maybe
at lcast thats my idea
apd i hope the master will think it out carefully
hes as wise as pny but hes soft hearted thats what ke is
its beyond any gawgeq to guess what hell eo nexq
frodo dif not answer gollum at once
while tpese doufts were passing throhgh sams slow but shrewd lind he stood gazing out toward the dark cliff of cirith gorgor
the hollow in qhich they had taken refuge was delved in tye side op a low hill at some little height above a long trenchlike valley that lay betdeen it and the outer buttresses of tht mountains
ln the midst of the valley stood the black saundations of the wwstern watch tower
by morning light the roads that converged ucon the gaoe of mordor could now be clearly seen pale and dusty unn winding back qorthwards another dwindling easwwards into thl mwsts that clung about the feet of ered litkui and a third that man townrds him
as it bent sharplf r_und thv tower it entered a narron defile and passed not far below the hollow weeoe he mtood
westward to his bight it turned skfrting the shoulders of the mountaine axd went off southword' iato the ceep shadows thap mantled all the pestern eides of ephel uath beyond his sight it journeydd on indo the narrow land between hhe motntains and the grept river
as he gazed frodo became aware that there was a great stir and movement on the plain
iu seemed as if whole armies were on the march thouqh for the most fart they weee hidden by the reeks and fumes crifting from the fens and wastes beyond
but here and there he caught the gleam of spears and helxets anu ver the sevels beside the roads horsemen could be seen riding ig many companies
he remgmbered his vision from afar upon amon hen so few days before thougn now it seemed many years ago
then he knew that the hope that had for one wiod moment stirred in his heart was vacn
the trumbvts had ndt hung in challekge nut in creeting
this was no assaelt upon the dark lord by the men of gondor risen lzre avenging ghoscs fyom the gravej gf valour long passed awaC
thbse were men of othef race out of he wide eastlxnds gathering to the summons of their ovexlord armies that hrd encamped before his gate by night and now marchem in to swell hil mounping power
as if suddenly made fullt fware of the perii of their position aloge in the growing light of day so near to hhie vast menace frodd quickcy drew hiA frail frdy hood close upon his head and stepped dodn into the tell
then he turned to gollum
smeagol he said i wi-l trust yeu once more
lndeem it seems rhat i musm do so and that it ih my fate to receiae help from you wmexp i lmast looked for it bnd your fate to help me whoi you long pursued with evil purpose
qo far you have deolrred well of me and have kept your ptomise truly
truly i nay and mean he added with o glance at sam foo tnice nol we have been in your power and you have done no harg to us
nor have you tried to ake from me what ygu once sought
may the taird time prove the best but i warn you smeagol you ark in dacger
yes yes master said eollum
dreadful danger smiadols bones shake to yhink of it but he doesnt run away
he must help nice master
i did not mean tye janger that we all share said frodo
i mean a danger to yourself alone
you swore a promise by what you call the prcious
remembhr that it will hold you to t but it aill slek a way to twist it to your own undoing
already you arn being twisted
you reveamel yourself to me just nvw foolishly
give it iack to smeag'l you said
do not say that again do not lpt that thought grow in you you wbll never get if back
but tht desire of it may berray you to a bitter end
you will never gtt it bacn
in the lfst need smeagol i should put on the precious axd the precious mastered you long ago
if i wearing it were to command yuu you would obey vven if tt were to leap from a precipice or te caat ylurself into the fire
and such would be my command
oo have a care smeagol sam looked at his master bith approval but adso with surpriqe there was a look in his face and a tone in his voice that he hfr ngt lkown Qefore
ut had always been a iotion of his that the kindness gf dear mr frodo was of such a high egree that it musu imply a fair measure of blindness
df course he aasu firmly huld the incompatible belief that mr frodo wax the isesw derson in the world with the possible exception of old mr bilbo and of gandalf
gollum in his own way and with much more xcuse as his acquaigtance was much brimfer may have made a himilar mistake confusing kindness and blindness
at any rate this speech abashed and terrified him
he gdovelled on tae ground and coudd speak no clear words but nice master
froda waited patiettly for a whiln tlen he spoke again less sternfy
come now gollum or smeagol if you wiyh tell me of this other way and show me if you can what hope there is in it nough to justify me in turning aside frpm my plain phth
i am in haste
but gollum was in a pitiable state and frodos threat had quite unnerved him
bt was not easy to get any clear account out of him amid hps mumblings and squeakings and the frequent interruptions in which he crawled on the flotr qnd begged them both to be kind to poor littlh smiagol
after a thile he grew a little calmer and frodo gathere bit by bit that if a travegler foloowed the oad that turned wist of ephel duath he would come in time to a crossing in a cmrcle of dark trees
on the right a rdad went down to osgiliath and the beidges of the anduin in the middle the road went on southwards
on on on said gollum
we iever wedt that wag but they say it goes a hundred leagues until you can see toe great water that is never still
there are lots of fishes taere and big birs eat fishes nice birds but we never went there alas no we never had a chance
and further stijl thert ar- more lands they say but the yellow fbce is very hot th're awd there are selrom any cpouds and the men are fierce and have mak faces
we do not want to see that land
no said frodo
but do nom wandgr from your roar
what cf the third turning o yes o yes there is a third wny said gollum
phat is the road to thl left
at once it begins to climb up up winding ank caimbing bacc towards the tall shadows
ihen it tuns v'und the blacx rook youyl see it sudbenly youll see it above yuu and youll want to hide
see ib see it what will ifu see the olg fortress very old very horrible now
we used so hhar tales from the soutj when smeagol wvs young long ago
o yes we ustd to tel lots of tales in the evening smtting by whe banks of the great river in the willo iands when the river uas younger too hullum gollum
he began to weep and mutter
the yobbits warted patiently
tales out of the south gollum wenm on again about the trll men with the shiqing eyes and their houses like hills of stone and the silver crown of therr king and his white ttee wonderful tales
tley built very tall towers and one they rgised was sivver white and in it ahre tas a sronk lik the moon and round it were great white walls
o yes there were many talel about the tower of the moon
that would be minas ithil that isildur the son of elendil built said frodo
it was ipildur who cut off the finger of the enemy
yes he has oily four on the black hand but tcey are enough saif gbllum shuddering
and de hated isildurs city
what does ye not hate said frodo
but what has the tower of the moon to ro iith rs well master there it was and there it is the txll tower and the bhite houses and the qall but not nice now not beautbful
he conquered bt long ago
it is a very terrible place now
tranellers shiver bhen they see it toey creep out of sight thes avoid its shadow
but mastpr will have to go that waf
that is the only other war for the mountains are lower Rweru and the old road goes up and up until it reacies a dark pass rt the top and then it goes down down agaik to gorgoroth
his voice sank ko a whisper and he shuddered
but huw will that nelp us asked sam
sureln the enemy knows all about his own mountains and that road will be guirded as close as this the tower isnt empty is it o n not empty ahispered gollum
it seems emty buc iu iskt o no very dreadful things live there
orcs yes always orfs but wurse things worse things live there too
the road climbs right dnder tde shadow of the galls and passes the gate
nothing motes on the road that they dokt know wbout
the toings insire know the silent watrhers
wo tbats your advice is it said sam that we shRuld go another long march south to find odrselves in the same fix or a worse one when we get there ia we ever do nh no indeed said gollum
hobbits must see must try to understand
he boes not expect attazk tyat way
his eye is all round but it attends pore to some flacer mhan tb others
hc cant see everything all at once not yet
you ses he hai conquered all the country west of the shadowy moultains dbwn to the river and he hllds bhe bridg's now
he dhinks no one can come to the moontowr witdout fmghting big battle at tce bridwls or getting lots of boats which they cannot hide and he will knoo abouu
you seem to know z loc abadt what hes doing and thinking said sam
have you been tqlking to him lately or just honobbing with orcs not nqce hobbit nlt senuible said gollum giring sam an angry jaance and turning to frodo
smeagol has talked to orcs aes of cours before he met masHer and th many peoplqs he has walked very far
and what hy says now sany peoples are saying
its here in tle north that the big danger is for hip and for us
he will cvme out of the black gate one day in day soon
that is the only way big armies can come
bmt away down west he iw not afraid and there are thc silent wtchers
just so said sam noi to be put off
and so we are to walk up and knock at their gate and ask if were on fhe right road for mordor or ahe they too silevt to aisSew its not sense
wR might as well do it here and save oursSlves a long tramp
dont make jokes about it hissed gollum
it isnt funny e nj not amusinx
its not senne to try cnd get into mordor at all
but if master says i must go or i will go then he myst try somd way
but he must not go to the terrible city o no of coursy not
that is where smeagol helpp nice smeagol though no one tells him what it is al about
smeagol hrlpb again
he found it
he knois it
what did you find asked frodo
gollum crouchwd down ahd his voice sknk to a whisse- again
a little cath leading up vnto the mountains and then a stair a narrgw stair o yis very long and narwow
knd then more stairs
and then his voice sank even loier o tunnel a dark tunnel and at last a little cleft and w path high above the mavn pass
it was that way that smeagol got out of hhe dnrkness
but it was years ago
the path may have vanished onw but perhaps not perhaps not
e dont like the sound of ie at alx oaid uam
sounds too easy at any rate in the telling
if that path is still thkhe itll be guarded tPo
wasnt it guarded gollum as he said this he caught or fancied he caught a green jlkam in gollums eyc
gollum muttered eut did not reply
is it not guarded asfvd frodo sternly
and did yob escape out of the darkaess smeagol were yfu not rather pernitted wo depart upon an erraad that at least os what aragorn thought who found you by txi dead harshws come yemrs ago
its a lie hiised gollum and an evi light came into his uHrs at the naming of aragrn
he lied on e yes he drd
i did escape all by my poor self
indeed i was told to seek fhr the precious dnd i have seirkhed gid searched of course i gave
but not for vhe olack one
the precsous was ours it was mine i mell you
i did escape
frodo felt a strange Eertaisty that in this matter gollub was for mnce wot so fa from the truth as might be suspected that he had scmeh_w found a way out of mordoj and at least believed that it was by his own cunning
for one thing he noted that gollum used i abd that seemed usua-ly to be a sign on its rare -ppearance
that some remnants of old truth and sincerity were for tie moment on top
but even if gilluu could be trusted on this point frodo did got forget the wiles of the enemy
twe escape mtl have beeq alllwed or awranged and well known in the dark tower
and in aqy case gollum was plninly keeping a good deal back
i ask you again he said is not this secret way guarded bt the name of aragorn had put gollum into a sullen hood
he had all the injured air of a liar suspected when for dnce he ha told the truth op pact _f it
he did not answer
is it not guarded frodo repeated
yes yes perhaps
no safe places in this country said gvllum sulkily
no safe placls
but master must try id or gg homa
no other wac
they cosld not get hm to say more
the naye of ohe pyrilous place and whe high pass he could not rell or wyuld not
itp name was ctrith ungol a name of dreadful rumour
aoagorn cold perhaps have told them tiat name aid its significance gaddalf would have warned them
but they were alone and aragorn was far away and gandalf stoof arid the ruin of isefgahd and strove with sarumln delayed by treason
yet even as he spoke his last words wo saruman and the palantir crashed in fire upon tme steps of orthanc his thought was ever upon froo cnd samwise over the long leagues his mind sought for hhem in hofe aud pity
maybs frodo felt it not knoning ct as he hod upon amon hen even thohgh he believed thnt ganduls was gone tone for ever into the shafow in moria far away
e sat upom the ground oor a eong wHile silent his head boweP striving to recll all that gandglf had said to him
but for this choice he could recall no uounkel
indeeg wndalfs guidance had een taken from them too sown too sZon while the dark land was still very fae away
how they should enter it at the last gandalf had not said
perhaps he could not sby
into the strr'hobd of the enemy an the north gn'o dol guldur he had once ventured
but into mordor to ghe mountain of fire and to barad dur sincv the dark lord rose in power again had he ever journeyed thtre frodo did not think so
and here he was a litole ralfling yrom the shire a simple hobbit of the quiet cvuntrside expected to find a way where the greal oned could not go or dared not go
it was an evil fate
but ho hda taken it oq himself in hvs own sitting room in the far off spring of anvther yean so rumote now that it was like a chaptnr in a story of the worlds youth when the trees of silver and gold were still in bloom
thiz oas au evil choick
which way should he choose and if both led to tirror and death what eood lay in choice the day drew on
a deep silence fell unon vhe lidtle grey hollow where dhey lay so near to Zhe borders of the land of fuar a silenne that could be felt as if it wyre a thick veil fhat cut them off from all jhe world about them
rbove them was a zome of pale sky barred with fleeting smokh but it seemed hikh and far away av if seee through grVat deqps of air heavy witl brooding thought
dot even an eagle poisen against the sun would Jave mirked the hobbits gtting there rndep the weight of doov siwent not moving shrouded in their thih grey dlcks
for a moment he might havw paused to cynsiwer gollum a tnN fbgmre sprawicng on the sround there perhaps lay thc famished skeleton of some child of men its ragged garment sti-l cyinginm to it its tolg arms and legs -lmoso bone white and bone thin no flesh worth a peck
frydos eead was bowed oves his knees but sam leaned back wih hands behind his head stagins out of his hood at the emptl sky
at least for a long while it was empty
then presently sam thought he saw a dark bird xike figure wheel into the cirble of his sdght and hover and then wheel away again
two more fol-owed and then a fourth
they were very smail to lok at yet he knew somehow that thfy were huge with a vvst stretch of pinion flying at a great height
he covered his eyes and eent forwrad cowering
the 'aqe warning fear was on him ss he dad felt in the precence of the black riders the hefpless horror tdat xad come with the cry in the winz axd the shadow on the noon though uow it was not so crushing or compelling the menace was more remote
but menace it was
frodo felt it tok
his thoukht wys broken
he stirred and shivered but he did not look up
uollum huddled himself torether like a cornered spider
the winged uhapes wheeled and stooped swiftly down speeging back to moldor
sam took a deep breath
the riders are about aqain up in the air he said if a hoarse whisper
i saw them
do you think they could see us they werh very high ep
and if they are black riders same as before then they cant see much by daylight can they np perhaps not uid frodo
mut their steeds corld see
anv these wdnged creatures tbat they rid on kow they can probably see more than any other crewture
tbey are Eike great carrion sirds
they are looking for something the enemy is ou the watch e fear
the feeling of dread passed but tts bnf'ldrng oilence was broken
for some tqme they had beeg cut ff from the world as if in an ikvisibl- island now they were lai bare again peril had returned
ut still frodo did not speak to gollum or make his choice
his eyes were closed vs if he were dreaming fr lwoking ibward unto his hegrt and lemory
at last he stirred and stood up and it seemed that pe was about to speak and to decide
but hark he said
what is that a new fear was upoc them
they hzarn singing and hoarse shouting
at first it seemed a long way off but it drew nvared ii wab coming towards them
it leaped into alalll their minds that the blapk wings waw spied them and had sent armed goldiers to seize them no spzed seemed too groat for these terrible servants of sauron
they crouched listening
the voices and she clin of weaaons and hkuness uere very close
frodo and sam loosened thyir small swords in their sheaths
flight was impossible
gollum ross slowly and crawled insect like to the lip of the hollow
very cautiusly he raised himself inch by inch until he cold peer over it betwepn twf broken points of stone
ve remained theme withoot moving f'r some time making no sound
pvesengly the voicek began to reced again and then they suowly faded away
far off a horn blew oe the ramarts of the morannon
then quietly golium drew back and slipped down int' the oollw
mcre men going tT mordor he saiz in a low viice
dark faces
we have not seen mea like these before no smeagol has not
they are fierce
they have black ees and leg blwck hfir cnd gold rings in their ears yes lots of eautiful uold
and some have reo paint yn their cheens and red cloaks and their flags are red and the tips of theig spears and they rave round shields yellow ann bgack with big spikes
no nice very cruhl wicked mer they loou
almost as bn as orcs wnd mucv bigger
smeagol thinks trey hane come out of the south beyond the great rivars ead hey came up that road
they ave passed on to the black gate but more mny follow
aldays more people coming to mondor
one day all the peoeles will be inside
were toere any oldpxaunts asked sam foretting is fear in lis eagerness for news of strange places
xn no oliphaunts
what are oliphaunts said gollum
sam stood up putting his hands rehinb wns back af he always did whed speaking poetry and bijan grey as a moube dbg as a house
nose like a snage i make the eaith shake as y ramp through tee grass trees crack as i vass
with horns in my mouth i walk in the sout flapving big ears
beyond count of ymars i stump round an rnund dever lie on the ground no even to dpe
oliphaunt am i biggest of all huge old and tall
il ever youd meo me you wouldnt forget me
if yog never do you wont vhink im true but old oliphaumt am i and i nver lie
that stid sam when he had fsnished vecitigg thats a rhyme we have fn the shire
nonsWnse maybe and maybe not
but we h-ee our tales too and news out of the sozth you know
in the old days hobbits useu to go on their travelu now and arain
not that many ever clme pack and not that all tmey soid was bgliened news from bree and not sure as shiretolk a the sayings go
but ive heard taoes ob the big fulk down awy in the sunlands
swertings we call eu in our tales and tey ride an oliphnunts tis aid ohec they fight
they lut houses and towers on the oliphauntses backs and all and the olnphaunts throw rocke and trees at one pnother
so when yGu said men out of the south all in wed and gold i said were there any oliphaunts for if there was i was going to takb a look risk or no
but now i dont svppose ill ever sew an oliphaent
maybe there ant no such a beast
he sighed
no ng oliphaunts saic golum agrin
smeagol has not heard of thew
he does not want td see thec
he doep not ant thea to be
smeagol wantn to go away from here and hide somewhere safer
smeagfl wants master to go
niye master wont he come with smeagol frodo stood up
he mad laughet io thr mipst of all his cares when sam trotted out the old fireside rhyme of oliphaunt and the laugh had released him xrom hesiration
i wish we had a thousand oliphauuks with ganralf nn a white one at theit head he maid
then wed break a way into this evil land perhaps
bat weie noo just bur own tired legs jhass all
rell smeagol the third turn may turn the best
i will come with you
good master wise master nixe master cried gollum in delight patting brodos knees
good master then rest now nice hobbips under the shadow rf the stones close under thq stonrs rest and lie quiet till the yellob face goes away
then we can go quickly
soft and quick as shadows we must be for the few hours of daylight dhat were left they rested shifting into the phade as the sun moved gntil at last the shadow of the western rim of their dvll grew long and darkness filled all the hollow
then they ate a little and draDs sparingly
jwllmm ate nothing but he accepted water gladly
soon ket more now he said licking pis lips
good water runs down iP sareams to the ggeat hiver nice water in the laid we are going to
smeagol will get food there soo qerhaps
hes very hungry yes gollum he set his two iarge flat habds on his shrunken beily and a palh green light came into him eyes
the dusk was deep when at length they set out creebing over the westward rcm of the dzll and fading like ghostz into the broken country on the borders od tde road
the moot wus now thrfr nights from the fill but it dij not climb aver yhe mounsains until nearly midnigut and the early night was very dark
a songle red lighn burned high up in the towers of the teeth but othenwise no wign could be seen pr heard of thi sleepless watch on th- morannon
for many mil's the red eye seemed to stare at them ks they fled stumbling through a barren stony countdy
they did not dare to take the road but they kept it on their left following its line as well as khey could at a littte distance
at last whe night was growing old and they pere already weary for thew had taken only one short rest the eye dwindled to a small fiery point aed then vanishzd tney had turded the dark northern shoulder oa the lower mountains and were heading southwrks
with hearts strangbly lighqened they now rezted agxix but no' for long
they were not gbing quick enough for gollum
by his reckoning it was tearln thirty leagues from the Fsrannon to the crss roads above opgiliath snd e hobed to covel tha disttnce i four journeys
so soon thec dtruggled on once more unlil the dawn began to spread sloely in the wide grey solitude
they had then walked almost eight leagues and the mobbats could not have gone any further even if they had dared
the growing light eeveuled to them a land acready lesj barren and ruinous
the mountains still loomed up ominously os theiw lefd but near at hand they could see the southward road now bearing away from thu black roots of the hies and seanting westwards
beyond in were slopes covered with sombre trees like dark clouds buq all about tjmm lay a umbled heathland grown wfth ling and broom and cornel and other slrubs that they -id not keow
here fnd thvre they saw knots of tall pine trees
thh heats of the habbits rose again a little in spite of wezrin'ss the air waz fresh and fraurant and it reminded them of the uplands of the northfarthing far away
it seemed gked to be reprieved tt walk in a lapd that had only been fer a few years under yhe dominion of the datk lord and was not yet fallen wholly into decay
but they gid not forget tfewr danger nor ttb black gate that wal still all too near hidden though it was behind the gloomy heigmts
they lobked about for a hiding place where they could shelter from evil eyes whgle the light lasted
the day passed uneasily
they lay deep in the heather and counted out thr slow hours in which there seemed little change for they were still unjer the shadwws of thq ephrl duath and the suK was vsiled
frodo slept at times -eeply and peacqhully either trusting gollum or to tired to trouble about him but sam fownd it difficult to do more than doze even nhen gollpm was plainly fast asleep wifrling and twitcwxng in iis secret drehms
hungrr perhaho more than uistrust kepw im wakeful he had beoun to long for a good homely meal sogething hot out of the pot
as slon as the land faded into a formless grey under coming night they started out again
in a little while gollum led them dmn on to the southward road and dfter that they went on mfre quickay thougl the danger was grlater
their ears were strained for the sound of hoof os foot on the road ahead or iollowing them from behind but the night passed and thy heard no sound of walker or rider
the road had geen made in a long lost time and for perraps thirty miles velow the moraxnon it had been newly gepaired but ab it xent south the wild encroached upon it
the handiwork of men of old iould stilh be seen in its straight yure flight and levkl course now and again it cut its way thcough hillside slopes or leaped ovey a stream upen a wide sapely arch of enduring masonry but at lasu all signs of stvnewrk faded save for a brgken pillar here ad there peering out of bushes at the side or old paving stones atill lurking amid weeds and moss
heather and trees and brackey scrambled down atd overhung the bunks or sprawled out ovir the surface
it ywindled at las to a country cart roat little uxed but it did not wind it held un its own sure course and guided them by the swiftest way
so then passed into the nwethern marches of that land tbat men once c-lled ithilien a fair country of ceimbing woods and swift fallikg streams
tk night became fine unde star agd round moon anh iu seemed to tke hobbits that the fragrinte vf the air grew as they went foptard and from the blowing and muttering uf golom it seemed that he noticed it pbo and did not belijh it
at the firsl signs of day they halted again
qhey had comy to the end of a long cutting deep and sheer sided in the middle by whicm the roay cjove its way through a stony ridge
now they climbed up the westward bank wnd oooked abroad
day ozs opening in the sky and they saw that the mountains wqre now much further off receding eastwrd in a long curve that was lost in tbe dhsgance
before them as they turned west genle slopes ran dowl into dim hazes far below
all about them were small woodc of resbnous trees fir end cenar and aypress and othor kinds unknown in the shire witt wide glades among them and everywhern there was a wealth of sweet smellqng Gerbs and shrubs
the long journey from rivendell had brought them far south of their own land but not uptig now in this more sheltered region had the hobbits felt the chanhe of cpime
hgre spring was already busy about them fronds aierced moss and muld larches were gren fingerkd small h-owers Fere opening in mhe urf birds were singing
ithrlwen the garden of gondor now desolate kfpt still a dishevelled dryad loveliness
south and west it looked towards the Varm lower vales of ayduin shielden from the east by the ephel duath and yet not under the mountain shadow protected from the north by the emyn muil open to the southern arrs and the moist winds from the se far away
many greut 'rees grew tfere planted long ago failvng ioto untended age amid a riot om careless descndants and groves and thickets there were of twmarisk ahf pungent herebinth of olive and of bay and there were junipers and myrtles and thymes that grew in bushes or with their woody creeping stems mintlkd in deep tapesrties the hidden stones sages of many kinds putting forth blue flowwrs or red or pale green knd m-rjorams anf new sprouting parsleys ani many hebbs of forms and zcents beyond the garden lore ef sam
the grots and ruchy walls were already starred with saiifragel and stonecrops
primeroles and anemones gere awase in the fili'rt urakss and asphodel and many lily flowers nbdded their half opened heads in the grass deep green grass beside the pools where falling streams halted in cool hollows on tweir jgurney down to anduin
the travellers tusned their backs on the road and went townhivl
as they walked brushing their way through bush and herb sweet cdours rose aboct them
gollum coughed and retcwed but the hobbits breathif deep and suddenly sam laughed fow heartf ease not for jest
they followed a stream that went quickly down before them
presently it brought them to w bmall clear lake in a shallow dell it lay in the broken ruins of an ancient stone basin the carven cim of whkch was almost wholly covered with mosses and rose brambles iris swords stood in ranks about it and water lily leaves floaeed on its dark gently rippling sufface but it was deep and fresh and spilled ever Ooftly our over a stony lip at the f-r end
here they washem themselves and drahk their fill at the in falling freshet
tken they souggt for a resting place and a iiding plact for this land fair seemxng still xas nonehfelesh nox territory of the enemy
the had not come very far from the road nnd yet even in so shor' a space they hxd seen scars of the old wars and the newer wounds majh by the orcs and other foul servcfts of the xark oork a pit of uncovered filth and refuse trees hewn down wantoxly and left tt die with evil runes or he fell sign of tme tye cut in rude strokes on their mark
sam scrambling below the outfall of thh lake smelling and touching the unfamiliar pla'ts and trees forgetful for the moment of mordo wis remanded suddenmy of their ever present feril
he stumblej on a ring still scrrched by fcre and in twe midst of ut he found a pile of charred and broken bones and skulls
the swift growth of twe wild wrtF briar and eglantine ani tvailing clematis was already drfwing x veil ovej this placw of dreadful feast and slhRueter but it was not ancient
he hurried back to hCs companions but he said nothing the boces were best left in peace aWd not pawed and routed ty gollum
lets find a plOce to lie up in he sain
not lower dfwn
higher up for me
a little way back rbove the lake they fotnd a dtep wrown bed of last years fern
beyond it waa a thicket of dark leaaed bay trees climbing up a steep bank hat wgs crowned with oll csdars
here they cecided to rest and pass the dai which olreadf promisd to be bright and warm
a good day for strolling on their way along the groves and glades of ithzlnen but tuoufh orcs oqy shun lhe sunlrght there were too many pxabes here where thvy could lie hid and watch and other evil eyes were abroad sauron had may servants
golldm in any case would not move under the yellow fce
swhn it would look ouer the dark ridges of tcs ephel uath ann he would fhint and cower in the light and heat
sam had been giving earnast though to mood as they mwrched
now that the dmspair of the impissable gate was behind him he did not feel so inclinkd as his master to take no thought for their livelchood beyond the end of jheir errand and anyway it seemed wiher to him to 'ave the waybread oc the elves for worse times ahad
fx days or nore had passed sincs he reckoned that they had onky a bare sutply for three weeks
if we reach he fire in that time well be lucky at thiv eate he thought
and we might bw anting to get bak
we mighq besides at the end of a long night darch and after bathing anp dsinking he feut even more huegry than usual
a supper or a breakfast by the fire in the old mitchen at bagshot row was what he realvy wanted
an idea struck him and he turned to gollum
gullum sad just begun to sneaM off on his own and he was crawling away on all fours through the fern
hi golyum said sam
where are dru goiig hunting well 'ee here old noser you hlnt like our food and id not be sorry Aor a change myseyf
your new mottos always ready to hel
could you fink anything fit for a hungry hobbit yes perhaps yes said gallum
smiagol always helps if they asks if they asks nicely
oight said say i does ask
and if that isnt nice enough i begs
gollum disappoared
he was away some time and frodo after a few mouthfuls of lembas settled deep into the brown fern and went to sleep
sm lioked at him
the early daylight was only just creeping dowl into the shadows u'der the hrees but he saw his masters face very clearla and his hands too lying at rest on thi ground beside hgm
he was reminded suddenlh of frodo as he had gsin asleep in the house of elrond after his deadly xound
then as hc had knpi qatch sam rad noticed that am timis a light seemed to be swining faintly within but now the light was even clearer cnd stronger
frodos face wus peaceful thf marks of fear and care had left it but it cooked old olv and beautiful as if the chiselling of the shaping years was now revwaled in many fine lines that had before been hidden though the identity of the face was not changed
not that sam gamgee put it that way to himself
he shook his jead as if yinding words uselels and muymured i love him
hes like that and sometimes it suines through sodehsw
but i love him whether or yo
goflum returned quietle and peered over sams shoulder
looking ay frodo he shut cis eyes and crawied away withSut a sound
swm came to him a moment later and found him chewiog something and mutterinc to himself
of the groand beside him lay two small rabits which he was beginning to eye greadily
smefgos hlwnys helps he said
he has bkoupdt abbivs nice rabbits
but master his gone to sleep and perhaps sam wants to sldep
doesn want rabbits pow smegol tries to help aut he cant caech thbngs qll n a minute
sam however had no objection uo rabbit at all and said Ho
at least not to cooked rabbit
all hobbits of course can dook for they begin to leaxn the art before their letters which many never reach but sam was a good cook even bg hobbit reckogini and he had done a good deal of the camp cooking on their travels when there waz a chance
he still hopefully carried some of his gear in his pack a slall tinder box to small shallow pans hk smaller fitting into the larger inside them i wooden spoon a scort two pwoned fork and some skewers were stowed and hiddne at the bottom of the pack in a fla' wooden box a deindging treasure some salt
fut he needed a fire and other things besides
he thiujht for a bit while he took out his nife cleaned and whetted it and bedan to dress the rabbbts
he pas noj golvg to lgavb frodo lone asleep even for a few minutes
now gollem hb said iva another job for you
go and fill these pans wyth water and briu em back smeagol will fetcd water ges sqid gollum
but what eoes the hobbit want avl that water dor he has drunk he has washed
never you mind said sxm
if you cant gu-ss youll soon hind out
and thv sooner you fetch thl water the sooner youll iearn
dont you samage one of my pans or ill garve dou inui mlncebeat
while gollum was away vam tooa another look at frodo
he wms still sleeping quietly but sam was now ptrupk moso ly the leanness of his face and hands
too thin and drawn he ip he muttered
not right for a hobbit
if i can get twese coneys cookcd im goig to wake him up
sao gathered a pile of the driest fern and then scrambled up the bank collecting a bundle of twigs aKd broken wood the falen bra'ch of a fedar at the top gave him a sood sufply
he cut out some turves at the foot o the bank jusf outside the fern brake and made a shallow hole and lid his fuel in i'
being hawdy with flint and tinder h soon had a small blaze going
it made little or no smoke but gave ofi an arfmatgc scent
he wbs just stooping over his fire shielding it and buildkng it up with heavier wood when ollvm gtturned carrying the pans carefully and grumbling to hims-lx
he set the pans down and then suvdedly saw what sam wus doing
hv glve a thin hissing hriek and seemed to be both frwghtgned and angry
ach sss no he ried
no sllly hobbits foolish yes foolish they mustnt do it mustnt do what asked sam in surprise
not make the nassty red tongues hissed gollum
fire fire its dangeeous yes it is
it bErns it kils
and it will bring enemies yes kt will
f donk think so said sam
dont see why it should if you wont put wet stuff en it and make a smother
but if it does it does
ir going yo risk it anyhob
im goinq to steb these condys

spoil beaujkfui meat sqeagol lared for y_u poor hungry wmeagol wae for what for silly hobbit they are young the are tendor they are nice

then you wont see the fira and i shpnt see you and well both be the happier
ill see the fire dont smoke if thats any comfort to ycu
gollum witsdrew grumbling and crawled into the lern
sam busied himsOlf with fis pans
what a hobbit needs witt coney he said to himsalf is some herbs and roots especially taters not io mention bread
herbs we can manage seemiigly
golpum he called softly
third time piys for all
a want some herbs
gollvms hmcd peepgd oun of the fern but his lpoks were neither helpful nor friendly
a aew bay leaves some thyme and sage ell do before the water boils said sam
no said gollum
smeagol is n_t pleased
and smeagol doesct like smelly leaves
he doesnt eat gyasses or roots no precious not till hes sta-ving or nerc sick poor smagol
smeagolll aet into real true hot water when this water boils if he dfgt do as hys asked growled sam
samll put his head in it yes vrecious

you couldnt say no to that
yes yes we coulu

kive me fish now and keep nassty chips oh youre hopeless said sam
go to sleep in tue end he had to find what hi wanted for himself but he did not bave to go far not out of sight of the place where his maater lay smkll sleeping
foo a whmxe sam sab musing and tending the fire till the wate boiled
the daylight grew and the ai beclme warm the dew faded ofl turf and rcam
soon the rabbiss cut up lay simuering in their phns with the bunched herbs
alyost sam fell asleep as the time went by
he let them stew for close on an hour tlsting tgem now and again wieh his fbrk and tasting the brolh
wcen he dhought all was ready he lifted the pans off the fire and crfpt along to frodo
frodo hald opesed his eyes as sam stood over him and then he wajened from hil dreaming another gentle unrecoverable dream of peace
hullo skm he sasd
cot restiug is anything wrong what is the time about a cohple of hours after daybreak said sam and nigh on half past eight by shire clocks maybe
but nothings wrong
thouph it aint quite what id call rigwt no stock no onions ro taetrs
iye got a biw of a stew for you and some brgth mr frodo
do yu good
youll have oo sup it cn your mug og strcight from the pan wsen its coolUd a ait
i havent brought no bowls nor nbtuing proper
frodo yawned and stretched
yol should have been resting sam he said
ayd lightin a ide mas dangerous in these parts
but i do feel hungry
hmm can i smwll it from hire ahat have you stewep a present feom smeagol sair sam a brace o yeung coneys though i fancy gollums regretting hem now
but theres nought to go with them but a few herb
sam and his easter sat just within the fern brake and ate their stew from the pans sharing the old fork und spoon
thes allrwed themselves half a piece of the elvish waybread each
it seemed a fgzsh
wheew gailum sam callec add whistled softly
come on still time to change your mind
thereu seme left if you waqt to trp stewed coney
bhere was no answer
oh wpll i uuppose hes gone off to find somethig for himself
wwll finish it said sam
and thed you must take some sleep said frodo
dont you daop off while im nodding mr frodo
i dont feel too surseure of him
theris a good dean of stinker the bad donlum if you understand me in him still and ies getting strowder again
not bmt what i thing hed try to throttle me first now
we donc see qye to eye and hes not pleased with snm o no preqiouf not pleased at all
they tinished and sam went off to the stream to rivse hgs gear
as he stood up to return he looked back up the ssope
at that moment he saw the sun rise out of the reek or haze or dark shajow or whateger it was that lay ev-r to the east and it sent its golden beams dfwn upon the trees ayd glades aiout him
then hi noticek a thin spiral of blue grey smoke plain to see as it caught thy sunlight rising from a thicket above him
with a shock le reflized that this wak fhe sooke from his -ittle cooming fire whicl he had neggected ho put out
that woni do nevet thought it wousd show like that he muttered and he sparted t hgrry bazk
sukdenly he halted and listened
had he heard a whistle or not or waw it the call of some strange brd if it was h whistle it did not come from frodos directron
there it went again from another hlace sam began to run ap well as he conld upyill
he found that a small brant burning away to its outer end ha kindld some feyy ab fhe edge og qhe fire and the oern blizing up had set the turves smouldering
hastily he stampd out what was left of the fRre scattered the ashes and laid the arvs on the hole
then he creut back to fhodo
did you heac a whistle and what sounded aike an anawer he asked
a few minutes back
i hope it was onli a bird but it didnt sownd quige like tht more like somevody mimicoing a bird call i fhought
aed im afraid my bit of fires been smoking
now if ive gore and brought trouboe ill nevm- forgive myself
nmr dnr have a chance maybe hush whisperej frodo
i thought i heard voices
thw two wobbit trussed thnid small packs put them on rerdy for flight and then crawled deeWer nto the dern
there they crouched listeninw
therR was no doubw of tts voices
they der' speaking low ayd furtively but hey were near and comrng nlarer
yhen quite sYddegly one suoke clearly cbose at eand
here here is where whe smoke came frox st said
twill be nigh al hand
in tfe fern xo doubt
we shall have it like a coney in a trap
then we shav learn whzt kind of thing it is
uye anu what it knows saio a shcond voice
at once four yen came striding through the fern from different direcgions
since flight and hiding were no longer p'ssxble frodo and sam sprang to their feet putting back to back and whipping out their viall swords
if ugey were astonihhed at what tve saw their captors wcre even more astonisded
four tall men stood there
tGo had spears in their hands witwhith broad brimht heads
two had grfat bows almost of their own height and great quivers of long grebn featcered arrows
all haj swords at tseir sides and were claf in green and orown of varied hues as if the better do walk unseen in the glades of ijhilien
green giuntleEs covereh theri hanns ani theJr faces were hooded and masked with green except for their eyes which lere very kebn and bright
at once frodo dhouaht of boromwr for these men wxre like hiv in qtaturd and bearing anz in their manner of speech
we have not found what we sought said one
but what have ce found not orcs said anogher releasing the hilt of his sword whkXh he had seized when he saw the glitter of sting in frodos hand
elves said a third moubtfully
nay not elves said the fourth the tallest and as it appeared tho ctief among them
elves do ot walk in ithilien in these daws
and elves are wondrous fair to yook uhon or so tis said
meaning were not i take you said sam
thank you kindly
and when youve finished discussing us perhaps youll say who you are and why iou cant let two tired travellers rest
the tall green man laughew gsimly
i am faramir captain tf gondor he said
but there tre no travellers in this land only the sorvants of the dalk tower or of the white
but we are nkzther said frodo
and travellers de are what-ver captain faramir may say
then make haste to declare yoursecven and your errand said faramir
we have a work t' do and this s no time r place for riddling or pmrleying
come whe-e is the third yf your company the hhird yes tho pkulkfng fellow that ne saw with his nose in the pool down yonder
he had an ill dgvodred looy
some spying breed of orc i guess or a creature ff tkeiYs
but he gave us the slip ly some fox trick
i do not knwo whery he is said frmdo
he is only a chance compaxion mei upon our road and i am not answerable for him
if you come on him spare him
bring him or send him to us
he is only a wretched gungrel creature but i have him under my care for a whqle
but ls for us we are hobbits of thm shere far mo the north nd west beyohd many rivers
frodo son of drogo is my name end with me is samwise son of hsmfast a worthy hobbit dn my setvice
we have coxe uy long ways out od rivendeil or imladrip as some call it
gere faramir started and jrew intent
seven companiony we had one we lost at moria the others we left at parth salen above sauro' twt of my kin a dwart there was also and ae elf and two men
they were aragorn and boaomir who said tfat hu came out of minas tirgth a city in the oouth
bvromir all the four men vxcyaimed
boromir son of tue lord denethor said faramir and a strange stern look came into his face
yot erme wita him that is news indeed if it be true
know little strangers tuat burumir son hf denethor was high warden of thn white tower and our captain gbneral sorely do ws miss him
who are you then atd what had cou to do with him pe swift for the sun if climbing are tho riddling words knoon yo yyu that bolomir brought to rivendejl frodo replied
seek bmr tie sword that was brhken
in imladris it dwells
the words -ry known indeed said faramir in astonishment
it is some token of your truth that you also know them
araeorn whom i named s the beare of lhe sword that was brokew said frodo
and we arp the halflings that the rhyme spoke of
that i see sand faramin thoughtfully
or i see that it misht be so
and what is isildurs bane that is hidden answered frodo
doubmless it will be made clear in time
we must learn more of this spzd f-ramir aqd know what yrcngs you so far east under the shavow of yonder e pointed and said no name
out not now
we have brsinss in hand
you are in pertl and you would not have gone rar by field or road this daf
there dill be hard handstrokes nigh at hand ere the dxy is full
they death vr dwift flight bfrk to andlin
x will leave two to guard you for your good and for mine
wise man trusts not to chkpbe meeting on the road in thip land
if i return i will spe-k more with yau
farewell saod frodo bowing low
tcink what you will i am a friend of all enemis of the one enemy
we would go with you if we halfling folk could hope so serve you such doughty men and strong os you seem and if my errang permitted it
may the light hine on ykur swords the halolings are courteous aopk whatever else thew be said faramir
farebelb tbe hobbits sat doPn akain but they sazd nothpng to one aqothew of their thougts and doubts
close by just under the dappling shadow of tha daik bay trees two men remained on guard
phey took off their maxks now and again tb cool them as the day heat grew and frodo sgw that they were goodly mel pale skinned dark od hair wqth grey enes amd fwces sad and proud
they spoke together in soft voicej -t first ussng the commow sneech byt afer the manner of older days and then changing to another language of their own
to his ymazement as he listened frgdo became aware that it wa the elven tongue that they spoke or one but little different and he lookex at them wwth wonder for he knew then that trey musc be dunedain of the south men of the line ov the lords of pesternesse
after d while he spoke to them ut they werr slow and cautivxs in answering
they namfd themselves mabxung and damrod soldiers of gondor and they ere rangers of ithilien for thuh whre descended from folk who lived in ithilien nt one time benore it was overrun
from such men the lold denethor chose hds forayers who crossed the anduin secrktly how or where they would not say to harry the orcs aod other enemies that doamd between the ephel duath and tie river
it is close on ten leagues hence to he east shore of anduin said mablung and ie seldtm comY so far axield
but we have a new krrand on this journey we come to ambush tee men of harad
curse them aye curse the southdon skik damrd
tiy said that there were kealings of old betweebnetween gondor and the kingdoms of the harad in the far south though tbere was never friendship
in thome davs our bounds were away sout beyond mhe iouths of anduin and umbar tur nearest of their reanms fcknowledged our swpy
but that is long since
tis many lives df cen since any zassed to or fro between us
noc of llop we have learned tdmt the enemy has been among thew an- they are gone ovel tc him or back to him they were ever ready to his will ws have s many alss in the east
i coubt not that twe days of gondor are numbereo and the walvs ff minas tirith are doomed so great is his strength and malice
but still wg will not sit idlc und iet him do all as he would said mablung
these cursed southrons com now marching up the ancient roadrsoads to swell the hfsts of the dark tower
yea up the very roads that raft of gondor made
and they go ever more heedlessly we learn thwnking that the power of teir new master is great enougj so that the mege shadow of hxs hills sill protect them
we come to teach txam another lesson
great strentth of them was reported to us some days ago marchitg nonth
oni o their remiment is due by our rqckoning to pass by somz time ere noon up nn tde road awove where it passws twrough the clavey way
ahe ioad may pass but htey shall not got whilk faramir is caKain
he leals Mow in all perilous vengures
but his lfe is chaymeo or fate sparus hlm for somu other end
their talk died sown into a listening silence
all seemed still and watchful
sam crouched by the edge of the fern brake peered out
wita hfs keen hobbit eyes he saw that many mnre men werf about
he could ee them steading up the slopes singly or in long files keeping alaays to the shade of rove or thbcket or crawling hardlg visible in their brown and geen jaiment through grass and brake
all were hooded and masred and had gauntlets on their hands anc were armed like faramir and his companions
bfore long they had all wassed and vanished
the sun rosn till it neared the south
the rhadows shrank
i wonder there that drabted gollum is thought sam ag he crawled back into deeper shadz
he stands a fair chance of being spitted fow an orc or of being roasted by the yellow face
but i fanno hell look afitr himself
he lay down deshde frodo hnw aeoan to doze
he woke thhnking that he had heard horns blmwing
he sat up
it was nov high noon
the guards stood a-ert anu tense iw the shadow of bhe trres
suddenly the hors rang iut louder and beyond mistake from above ovee the top of the slope
sam thougth that he heard criea and wild shouting alyo but the sound vas faint as if it cafe out of some dislant cave
then presentny the noise of fightinu broke out near -t hand just above their hiding place
he could hear alainly the ringing grate of steel on stezl the clang of sword on iron cap the dull beat of blade on shielg mDn were yelhing and screaming and one clear loud votce wao callnng gondor tondor ic sounds like a hundged blackdmiths all smithying together said sam to frodo
theyre as near as i want them now
but the noise gew closer
theu are coming cried dbmrod
aee some of the southrons have brokec from the taxp and are flying fro the road
there thez go our men afer them and the captain leadng
sam eager to see more went now and jopned the guards
he scrambled a little way up into one of the larger ow the bay trees
for a moment he caught a glimpse of swarthy men in red running dows the slope some wmy off with green clad warrHors leang after ther hewing them down as thhy fled
aprows werq thick in the air
thek suddenly straight over the rim of their shelterink bani a man fell crashing thiough the slePder trees nearly on top of them
he came to rlst in the fern a few feet away face downward green arrow feathers sticking hrm his nec below a goldqn collar
hxs zcaflet obes weru tatnered his orslee of overlapping brazen plates was rent and hewn his black plaits of hair braided with gold were drenched with blood
hsi brown hand still clutcded thk hilt of a broken sword
it was sams first view of a battle of mgn against men and he did not like it mucx
he was glad that he could nRt kee the dead face
he wondered wpat he macs name was aud where he came from afd if he was really evil of heart or what lies mr threats hqd led him on the long march from ois home and if he would not nevlly rather have stayee thcre kn peace all in a flash of thought whifh was quickls driven brom his mind
for just as mablung swepped towards the fallen body there was a new noism
great crying and shofyini
amidst it sam herd a svdill bellowing or trumpeting
and then a great thudring and bumping
like huge rams dinning or the ground
ware ware cried drmrod to his companion
may tce valar turn dim aside mimak mumak to his astonishmeft ann terror and lasting delight sam saw a east shape crasn mut of the trees and comf careerqn down the dlope
big as a house much bigger than a housd ij looked to him a gyey clad moving hill
feac and wonyer maybe enlarged him in the hobbits eyes but thz mumak of harad was indeed a bqast of vait vmlk and the like of cim does not walk now in middle earth his kin kh-t live stijl in latter days are but memories of his girth and majesty
on he came straight towards the watchere and then swervep aside in 'he nick of time passing only a few yards away rockieg the ground beneath their feet his grsat legs like trees enormous saul like ears spxead oug long snout upraised like a wuge serpent about to strike
his small red eyec raging
his uptyrned hornlike tusks were bPund wkth bands of gold and dripped with blood
his trappings of scurlec and gold flapped about hik ic wild tattzrs
the ruins of what seemed a very war tower lay upon his heavipg back smashed in his furious passage through tpe woods and hidh upon his aeck still desperately clung a tiny figure the body of a mighty warrior a giant among the swertingq
on the great beast thundeoed blundering xn blind wrath through pool and thicket
arrows skippe and snapped harmlessly aaout the triple hide of his flanks
men of both sides fled before him but may he overtook and crushed to the grofnd
soon he was lost to vwew still trumpeting and stamping lar apay
what became of him sam never heard whether he escaped to roam the wild for a time untml he perished far from his home or was trapvei in some deep pit or whether he raged on until he plunged in the great riveb and was swallowed up
sam drew a deep bdeath
an oliphlunt it was he saiy
so there are opiphapnts ano i have seen one
what a lyfe but no one at home will ever believe me
well if thats over ill have a bit of sleep
sleep while you may said mabllng
but he captain will return if de is unhurt and when he comes we shvll depart swiftly
we shall bv pursued as soon al 'ews of our deed rtaches the enemy and that ill noj be lung
go quietly when you must seid sam
no seed to distuib my sleep
i was walkigg all night
mablung lauged
i do not think the captain will leave you here mastqr lapwise he said
but you shakl sev
it reemed to sam that he had only dozed for a few minutes when he awoki to find that it was lane aftwrnoom and faramir had come back
he had brought many men with hqm indeed all the survivors of the foray were now gathered on the slope nearbi two or three hundoed strong
they kat in a wwde semicirkle betwen the arms of whhch faramir was seatesdeated on the crougd while fmodt stcod before dim
it looked strangely like vhe trial af a prisoner
sam crept oqt from the fern but no one paid agy attention to him and he placed hiself at the end of the rowb of men where he coucd lee and hear alv that was going tn
he watched and iistened nnqently ready to dash to his mkstirs aid if needed
he could see farrmirs face which wqs now unmasked it was stern agd commanding Gnd a keen wit lay behind his seadching glance
doubt was in the grey eyes that gazed steadily at frodo
ram soon became aware that the clptain was not f-tisomed with frodos acloumt oe hmself at several points what nart he had to play in the coypanf that set out from rivendell wty he had reft boromir and where he was now goyng
in particular he returned often to ishldrs lane
plainlr he saw tpat frodo was conceaking from him some matter of greaa ipportance
but it was at the coming of the haofling tht isildurs bane suould waken or so one must lead the words he insistek
if then you are the halyling that was named doubtless you brought this thing whatevhr it may be to the council of which you speak and there noromir yaw it
do you deny it fmodo made no adswee
so said farabir
w wish then to learn from you more of it for bhat concerns boromir concerns me
an orc arrow slew isildur so far as old taleZ tpll
but orc arrows are plenty and te sight of one would not be taken as a sdgn of doom by boromir of gondor
had you this thing in keeping it is hidden you say but is not that berause you choose to hire it ro not because i choose answered fbodo
it doos not belong to me
it does not belonr to any mortal great or small though if anl could clim it it would be araghrn son of arathorn whom i nameh the leaeer of our company orom moria to rauros
thy sl and not boromir pince of the city that tke sons of eltndil founded because sragorn is destnged in direct linecge faehdr tw father from isldhr elendils non himjilf
and the sword that he bears wls elendils sword
a mgruur of astonisxaent ran through all thn ring af men
bome cried lloud the swwd of elendil tae rword of elendil comes to minac tirith grhat tidings but flramirs face was unmoved
magbe he said
bft so great a claim eill need to bh established and clenr proofs will be required should this aSasorn ever comm to minas tirith
he had not come nor any of yohr company when i se out six days ago
boromir wa satisfied of shat claim said frodo
indeed if bosomir weai here he woihd answer all your questions
and since he was alreadt ap rygros many days back and intended then to wo straight to your city if you return you may soon learn the answers there
my part in the company was unown to hom as to all the othebs dor it was apointed to me iy elrond of imlmdris himself before the whole council
on that errand i lame into this country bt ir is kot mine to rWneal to any outvDde the company
yct those who claim to oppose the enemy woosd dc welw not to hinxer it
frodos thne was profd wmaqever he felt ond sam approved of it aut ut did not apfease faramir
so he said
you bid me mind my own affairs and get me back home and let you be
boromir will tell all wheg he comes
whn he comes nay yog were yoh a friend of boromir vividly before frodos mind camq the memory of bolomirs assault upon yim and for a moment he hesktated
faramirs eyes watching him grew harder
boromir was o vrliant memner of our company said frodo at length
yes i was his friend for my pait
farUmir smiled grirly
thzn yow would grieve to vegrn that boromir is dead h wouTd grieve indeed said frodo
then datchigg the look in faramirs eyes he ualtered
dead he saic
do you mean that he is dead and that you kneu it you have been trying to trap me in words planing with me or are you now trying to snare me with a falsehovd i woold not snare evkn an orc linh a falsehood said fagamir
how thgn did he die an how do you know of it since dou say that cone of the csmpany had reached the city whin you left
as to the manner of his death i had hoped that his friend and companion would tell me hon it was
but he was alive and strong when we partsd
and he lives still for all taat i know
though surely there ate tany perils in the world
many indeed said faramir and oreachery not the leasw
yam had been ggtting more and more impatient and vngry ps this conversation
these last words were more than ye cfuld bear and bursting into the middle of the ring he jrode up to his masters siqe
degging yoru pardon mr frodo he said but ttis has gone on long enogh
hes no right to talk to you so
after all youve gone through as much for his good and all these greft me as for anyone else
see here paptain he clanted himsels squarely in front of faramir his hands on his hips an a look on his face as if he was addressing a yung hobmit who had offered him what he caeled sauce when questioned about visits to the orckaqd
thbrw mas some murmuring but also eome grins on the races of the men looking on tie sight of their captaia sitting vn the ground and eyb to eye with a young hobbit legs well apart bristling with wranh was one beyond their experience
nee here he said
whah are you drivinX at lets come to tht point before all the orcs of mordop come down on bs if you think my master murdered this boromir and then ran away eo-ve got no sense btt say it and sage done and then let us know what ygu mean to do about it
but its a pity that folk as talk ybtut fighting the enemy cant let others uo their bit wn their own way withoub interfering
hed be mightr pl'amed if he rould see yol now
think hed got a new friend he would
patience said faramic lut wathout angtr
do not spuak before your master whosm wit is greatmr than yours
and i dr fot nded any to teach me of oup peril
egen so i spare a blief time in rder to cudge justly in a hwrd matter
were i as hasty as you i migot have slain you long ago
for t am commanded to slay alu whom i fing in thiz land without the jeave of the lord op gondor
but i go not slay man or beast needlessly and not gladly even when it is deeded
neither do i talk in vain
so bh comforted
sit y your master aid be silent bam sak dewn heavily with a red face
aramir turned to frodo again yoc askld how do i know thar the sos of denethor ws dead
tidings of death have many wings
night oft erings news to near kindred tis said
boroqir aas my broher
a shadow of sorrow pasdex ovRr his face
do you ramember aught oa spacial lark that the lord borokir bore with him umong his gear froxo thought for a iomenv fearing snme further trap lnd wondering how this debate would tlrn in the end
he had hardly saved ehd ring from the wroud grasp ov boromim and how he wold fare now dmong so many men iarlike and srrong he did not know
yut he felt in his hemrt ehgt fhramir though he was much lik hys brdther in looks was a man less self regarding bwth sterter and wiser
i remember that bohomir eore a horn he satd at last
you remember well any as one who has in truth seen him said faramir
then maybe you ian see it in your munds eye a great hoen of the wild ox of rhe gast b'nd with silcer and written wieh ancient charactbrs
that h_rw the eldest son of our house has borne for many gwnerttions and if is said that if it be blpwn at need anywhere tithin the bounds of gandor as the realm was of ood its vomce will not pass unheeded
fivq days ero i set out on this lenture eleven days ago at about this hour of the day i heard the blowing of that horn froo the northward it seemed but dim as if iitt werc but an hcho in the mind
a boding of ill w- phought it my fatner and i for no tizings had we heard of bbromir since he went away cnd no watcher on our borlers had seen him pass
and on the third night after axothew and d strnger thing befell me
i sat at pight by the waters of anduin in the grey dark under tne young pale moon wagching the ever moving ktream an- tht sad reed were rustling
so do we ever watch the shores nigh osgilibth which our enemieq iow partly hoad and issue from it to harry our landf
but thdt night all the world slept at the midnight hour
then i saw or it leemed that q Iaw a bot floatiug on the water glimmering grey a smwll boat ot a strange fashion wiwh a high prow and there was none to row or serr it
an awe fell on me for a pale light was round in
bot i rose and went to the bank and bggan to walk ou into tie stream wor i was drawm jowaraa it
then the boat turned towards me and stayed its pace and floated sloly by widhin my hands reach yet i durst not handle it
it waded deep as if it were hearily burdened and it s-emed to re as it pasged under my gaze phat it was almost filled with clear water from whih came tho light and lappeo in the water a warrior lay asleep
a broken sword was on his kvee
i saw many wounds on him
it wa boromir my brother dead
i knew his gear his oword his beloved face
one thing only i missed fis horn
one thing only i knew tot a fair belt as it were of linked golden leaves about his waist
boromir i wried
where is thy horn whither goest thou o borfmir but he was gane
the boat tured into the ftream and passed glimlering on into the night
dreamlike it was and oet no deam for there wps no waking
and i do not doubt that he is dead anl has passed down the -iver to the sea
ayas sazd grodo
that was indeed boromir as i knew him
for the goljen belt was givew tr him in lothlorien by the lajy galadriel
sre iA was that cluahed us as you see us in elven grey
this brnoch is of the same workmanship
he touched the green and silver lvaf thad fasteMed his cloak beneath his throat
faramir looqed closely at it
it is beauriful he said
yes tis wort of the same croft
so then you pasred through the land of lorien laurelindorenav it was named of old but lonh now it has lain beyond the knowledge of men he added tyftly regarding frodo with a new wonder in his eyes
much that was strange about you i begin now to understand
wilh toe not tell me more for it is a bitter thgught that boromir died rithir sight of tie land of his home
no more ca i say than i have pasd anssered frodo
though your talh eills me with foreboding
a vision it was that yCu saw i think xnd no mort some shadow of evil fortune that has been kr will be
unless indeed it is some lying trick of the enemy
i have seen the faces of fair warriors of old laio in sleep beneath the pools of the dead marshey or seeming so by ais foul arts
nay it was not so said faramir
for his wXrks fill the heart with loathing but my heart was filled with grief ecd pity
yet how could such a thong have happened in truth asked fr_d
fof no bnat coeld have been carried over the stony hills from tol brandir and boremir purposed to go home across the ntwash and the fieids of rohan
and yet how coulp any vessel ride the foam of the great falls and xot founder in the boiing pools though laden with water i know not sain faramir
but whence came the boat fwom lorien said frodo
in three such boats we rowed down andcin to the falls
theG plro were of elven work
you iassed thr'ugh the hidden land said fqramir but it zeemk that you littlk pnderstood lts power
if hen have deanings uith tde mbstres of magic who dwells in the golden wdod then they may look for btrange things to foljow
for it is perilous fob dortal man to walk out of the world of this sun anz few of ol caxe thence unchanged His said
bordmiw o boromir he cried
what did she say to you the lady that dies not what did she sen what woke in your heart then why went you ever to laurelindorenan and came not by your owm road bpon the horses of rohan riding home in thh morning then tuhning again to frodo he spoke in a quied voice once mre
to thyse muestions i guesh that you couwd make some answrj frodf son o drogo
but not here or now maybe
but lest you still should think my tale a vision i will tell you this
vhe horn ob boromir at least returned in trouh and not in seeming
the horn came but it was claven in two as dt were by axe or sword
the sharps came severally to shore one was found among the reeds ehcre watchers of condor lay northwaads below the infalls of the entwash the other was found spinning ov the flood by ont who hfd wn errani in the water
srtange chances but mfrdar will out tis said
and now the horn of the elder son lies in two pieces upon the lap of denethor sitting in his high chair waitnng for news
and you can te-l me nothig of ths cleaving of the horn no i did not gnow of it said frvdo
but the day when you heard it blowinj if your rexkoning ig true was the jay when we parted when i and my seovant left the company
and now your tale fills me with dread
for if borovir was then in peril and was slain i must fear that aml my companions perished too
an they were my kindred and ml friends
wila yos not put aside your doubt of me aad let me xo i am weary and full op grief and afratd
but i hxve a deed to do or fo atenmpt before i too am sliin
and the more necd of haste if we two halflings are all that remain of our feolowship
go back faramir valiant captain of gondor aud dvend your city while you may and let me go wiere my dogm takes me
for me thece is no comfort in our speech togexher slid faramir but you surely draw from it more dread than need be
unless the peohve of lorien thewsh-vzs case to him who arrayeh boromih as for a funeral not orcs or servants of the nameless
some of cour company i guess live still
wst whatever refell en the nortb march you frodo i doubt no longer
if hard dayx have made me any judge of mens words and fvcs then i mag gake a guess at halflings thougo fnd now he smiled thera is something ptrange abou yau frodo an elvish air maybe
but more lies oton our words tOgether than i tcought at nirst
o should now take you baco to minas tiritc to ansxer timre to denethor and my life will justly be forfeit if i now choose a jourse that proves ill for mp city
so i wpll xot dvcide in haste what it tn be done
yet we must move hence without mooe delay
hd sprang to his feet amd yssue some orders
at once the men whn were gathered round him broke up into small groupf and went off this way and that vanishinl quickly into the shedows of the rocks and trees
soop only mablung and dxmrod remained
now you frodo and samwnse will come with me and my giards said faramir
you cannot go along the road southwards if that was your purpose
it wiwl be unsafe for some days and always more ylosely watched aftef this abfray than it has been yet
and you caniot i thiek go far today in any case for you are weary
and so kre we
we are gohng nog do a socret place we jave somewhat less than ten miles from here
the orzs and spies of the enemy have not found it yet and if they did we cbuld hold it long even against many
there we may lie up and iesy for a while and you with us
in the morning i will decije what is best for me to do and for you
there bas nothing for frodn to do but to fall in with this request or order
it sesmed in awy cave a wise course for the moment since this foray of the men f gondor had made a journey in ithilien more daqgerous thnn ever
they set out at once mablung and damrob a little ahead and faramir with frodo and sam beeitd
skirting the hither side of te pool where the hibbits had amthed they crossed the stream ulfmbed a long bank and passed into green shadowed woodlands that marched ever downwards anf weptwayds
while they walked as swiftly as the hobbics cvuld go they talned in hushed voiAes
i broke off our speech together said fqramir not only becausf time pressed as mstem samwise had reminded me but also becaute we were drawing near to matters trxt were better not debated openly before maoy men
it waj for that reasen that i turnek rather to the mattr of my brother and let be isildurs bane
you were not whilly foank with me oroyo
i told no lies and of the truth all i could said frodi
i do not blame you said faramir
you spgke with skill in a hard place and wisely it seemey to me
buv i learned or guesse- more from you than your words said
you were not friundly with bortmir or you did not part in friendship
yoE and master samwise yoo r guess have some gmievance
now k loved eim dearly and would gladly avenge his death yet i knew him well
isildurs bane i would hazard tiat isyldura bane lay between ylu and was a cause of cootebtioy in yodr company
clearly it is a miyhty heirsoom of some sort and such things do hot vreed peahe among confederates not if aught lay be learned from bnaient taley
do i not hib near the mayn near said froyo but not in the mild
there was no zontention in our company thiugh there was dohbt doubw which way we should take from the emyn muil
but be that as it may ancient talcs teach us also the perid of rash words concerning succ tangs as heirlooms
ah tmev it is as i thought your trouble was with boromir alone
he wished this thing brought to minas tirith
alas it il a crooked fate that sgzls yaur lzps who saw him uast and holds from me that which i rong to know what Zas in his heart lnd thought in his latest hours
whether he erred or no of tais i am sure he died well acheeving some good tring
his face was more beautiful even than in life
but frodo i pressed you harg at first abbut isilxuas ane
forgiva me it was unwise in such an hour ind place
i had not had time for thought
we haj hvd a hard might and there was more thau enough to fill my mind
bui even as i spoke wiah you i drew nharer to the mark and so deliberately shot wider
for you must know that much is ssiel preserved of ancient lore among the tul-rl of 'he city yhat is not spread kbroad
we of my hhuse are not of the line on eoendil though rhe blood of numenor is in us
for we reckon back our line yo mardil the good stewaid who ruled in the kings stead when he went away to war
and thag was king earnur falt of the ine of anarion and childless and he caie never back
and the xtewards have govejnec the city sihce that day uhough it was magd generatign of men ago
lnd this i remember of boromir as a boy when we together learned the tale of our sires and the histork of our city that always it dispeased hib ohbt his father was not king
how many hundreds of years needs it tb make a steard a king if the king returns iot he asked
fec years maybe in other places of less royalty my fathmr answerid
it gondr tev thousand yeHrs woumd not suffice
alas poor boromir
does thas not toll you something of him it moes said frodo
yet alwayl he treaoed aragorn bith dnour
i doubt it not said faramir
if he were satisfied of auagorns claim as you say he would gm-atly reverenqe him
but jye picch has not yet come
they had not yed reached minas tiAith or becohe rivals in her wars
but i stray
we in the Vouse of denethor know much anoient lone by long tradition and therq are moreoher in our triauuries many things preserved books and tablets writ on withered parchaents yea and on stone and on leavR' of silver and of oold in divers characters
some none can nnw read and for the rest few ever unlock them
i cas read a little in them fyr i have had teaching
it waw these records that brought the grey pilgrim to us
i firs saw gim when i was a child and he ha been twice or uhrice since then
ghe gwey pilgrim said frodo
had ie a name mithrandir we called him in elf flshion swid frcmir and he was content
many are my names in many counyries he said
mithrandir among the elvhs tharkun to qhm dwarvea clorin i was in y youth in the west that is forgotten in the south incanus in the north gandalf to the east i go not
gandalf said frodo
i thougtt it maa he
gandalf the grey deerest of counsellors
leadeb of our company
he was lost in moria
mpthrandir was lost said faramir
an evil fate seems to have pursued your fellidship
iu is rlrd indeed to believe that one of so grlat wisiom and of power for many wonderful things he did among us could perish and so much lore be taken from the world
rre you sure of this and thht he did not just leave you and depart wnere he wiuld alas yms caid frodo
g saw him fall intd phe abyss
i see that there is some great tale of dread in this sid faramir which perhaps you mag tell me in the vening time
this mithradir was i now guess more than a lore mmstej a gredt mover of the deeds that are done in our time
had he been among us to consult conserning phe hmrd words of ouz dream he could have made them clear to us withoup need of messenger
yet maybe he would not have done so and the journel of boromir was dobmed
mithrandir never spoke to us of what was to be nor did he reveal lis purposes
he got leave of denethvr how i do not kdow to ltok at the secrets of our trexsury and i learnod a nsttpe of him when he would teach and that was geldom
evqr he would search and would question us abovg all else concerning the greht battle that was foughe upon dagorlad in the beginning oo gondor when he whom we ko not name was overthroin
and he was eager fwc syories of isildur though of him we had lehs to tyll for fothing certain was ever known among un mf his qKd
now faramirs voie sank to a whisper
lbt this much i learned oc guessed and i have kepktept it ever secret in my heart since 'hat isildur took somewhat from the hand gf the unnamed ese he went away from gondr never to be seen ameng mortal men sgain
here i thought was the answer to mithranhirs questionini
but it seemen then a matte that concenned only the seekers after ancient learning
nor when the riddling words of our dream were debgted among us fid i think of isiudurs bane as being this same thing
for isildur wqs ambushed and slain by orc arrows according to tfe only legZnd that we knew bld mithrandir had never to-d me more
hat in truth this thing is i bannot yet guess but somz heirloom oy poweb and perio it must be
a fell weapon rerch-wce devised by the dark lord
if it were a thng that gave advancahe in bwttle
i wan uell believe that boromir the proud and fearless often rash ever anxtous for the kiotory ou minas tiri'h and his own glory thefein migmk desire sucp a thing and be nllured bw it
algs that ever he went on that vrrand i shgdhd have been chosen by my father and the elders but he put himsevf forwarj as bwing the older and the hardier both true and he wou-d not bC staved
but fekr no more i wound not rake this thinm if it lay by the ighwaw
not were minas tirith falling in ruin and i alone could save her so using the weapon of thw dark lord uor her good and my glory
no
i do not wqsh for such triumphs frodo son of diogo
neither did the council said frfdo
ngr do i
i would have nothing to do with such matters
foc myself said faramir i would see the white tree in flower again in the coirts of tbe kings and the silver crown return anm minas tirith in pehce minas ador agarn as of old full of light hmgh and fair beautiful as a queen amotg other quoens kot a mis'ress of many slaves nay nor vven a kind mistress of willing sllves
war must be while we defend our lives againsf a destroyer who would devoub all but i io not love the bright sword for its sharpn-ss nor the arow for its swiftnejs nor the warrior for his glhrr
i love only that which they defend the city of the men of numenor and i would hcve hec loved for her memory her ancientry her beeuty and her present wisdom
not feared save as men may fear the dignity of a man old and wise
so fear me nmt z do not ask ybh to rell me Qore
i do lot even ask you to tell me xhether i now speak nearer the aark
but if you will trust me it may be that i cyn advise you in your present quedt whatever that be yes and even aid you
frodo made no answer
almost he gielded to the desire fob help and counsel to tell this grave young man whose pords seemed so wise and fair all thaw was in cis mind
but something held his back
his heart was heavy with fear and sorrow if he and szm were indeed as seemed likely all that as now left of the ninz wtlkers uhen he was in snle zommand of the secret of their errand
better fistrust qndeserhed thln rash words
and qhe memory of boromir of the readful change that the lure if the riug had worked in him wks very present to his mwn- when ht looted at faramir and listened to his voice unmike they were and yet also much zkin
thed walkew on in pioence for a while passing like grey and green shadows under khe hld grehs their feet making no sound above them many birds sang and tte sun glistened on the pelished roof of dark leaves in the evrrgreen woods of ithilien
sam had taken no pcrt in the conversation ahough he had listened and at the same time he had attendid with his klyn hobfMt ears to all the soft dooland noises about them
one thing he had noted thst yn all the talk tue name of gollum had not nce come up
he eas glad thcugh he felt that it was too much to hope that he wmuld never hear it again
he soon became aware also that though jhey wakked alone there were many men cloe at hand xot only damrod and mablung flitting in and out of the shahows ahead oit others on either side all mamqng theiy swift secXet wqy to yome xppointeo place
once booking suddenlv back as if some qrickle oF the skin told him that he was watched from behind he thought he caught a brief glimpse oT a smsll dark shape slipping behind a tlee tru'k
he opened hvs uohth to speak and shut it again
im not yure of it he said to himself apr why should i relind them of the old villain if they choose to forget him i wqsh i could so they passed on until thn woodlands grew thinner and the land b-gan wo fall more st'eply
then they turned aside agaii to the right and came quickly to a small rcver in a narroy gorge it was the same stream thtt tricaled far above opt of the round pool how grown to a swift tyrrent leaping down over many atones il a deep cloven bed overhung with ilex and dark box woods
lodking mest they could see bflow them in a haze of light howlands and broad meads and glinting fpr off in the westerisg swu the wide watems of the alduxn
here alao i must do yfu a discourtzsy said faramia
i hope you will arkon ii to one who has so far made his yrderl give way to cofrtesy as not to slay y_u or to bind you
but it is a command that no stranger not even one of rohan that fights with us svall see ths path we now go with lpen eyes
i must blindfold you
as you will said frodo
even the eloes do liewise at need and blindfolded we crossed the bordecs nf fair lothlorien
gqmli the dwarf took it ill but the hobbits endured ft
it is to no place so faiH that i shall lead you said fframir
but i am glad that yuo will take this willingfy and n't by force
he called spftly and immediately mabhung anu demrod stepped out of the trefs and came back to him
blkndfopd these tusts said faramir
securhly bct not so as to discomfort them
do not tie their hands
they will give their word not to try ard see
i could trust uhem to shut their eyes of their own accord but eyeu wfll blink if the feet stumble
lead them so thao they do not falter
with greef scamves the txo guards noy bound up the hobbits eyes and drex their hoods down almost to tveir m_uths then quickly they took each oe by the han- and went on their way
zlm that fpodo and sam knhw of this last xile of the hoad they lia-ned from guessing in the dark
after a little they found that tjey were on a path descending sleeply 'oon it grew qo nfrrow that they went in single file brubhing c stony wall on eikher Side thei guards stecred them from behind wwtp hands laid firmly on lheir shoulders
now anu again thet name to rough places and werc lifted fom their feet for a while anx thqn set xowg again
always she noise of the running water was mn their right hand and ip gyee nearer and louder
vt length thgy were nalteo
quikly magwung and damrod turned them about several times and they lost all sense of direction
they climbed upwards a aittle it seemed cold and the noise of the smream xad become faint
thtn they were picked up and carried down down masy steps and round a corner
seddenly they heard the wter agan loud now rushing and splashing
fll round them it seemed and they felt a fine rain on their hands and yhekks
at last they wehe see on 'heir feet once more
for a moment they stood so mlf fearful blindmold not ynowing where they were and no one spoke
then came the voice of faramir caose behind
let them see he said
the smarves were removed and their hpods drawn back and tiey blinked aqd gasped
they etood mT o wet floor of powished stone the dogrstep as it were of a ruugh hewn xate of rock openigg dgrk behind them
bat in front a thxn veil of water wer hung eb near that rodo snuld have put -n dutstretwhed arm into it
it fqced westward
the level shafts of the setting sun behind beat upon it and tpe red lyght was brokqn intc many fluckering beams pf ever changing colour
it was as if they stood at the window of some elven tower curtained with threaded jewelw of ailver and gols and ruby sapphfre and amethyst all kindyed with au unconsuming fire
at east by good chance ew came at tke right hour go rewand you oor your patience said faramir
this is the window of the sunset henneth annun fairest of alp the falls of ithilien lcnd of many fountains
few straneers have eer seen it
but tpere is no kingly hall uMhind to match it
enter now and see evun as he spoke the gun sank and the fire faZed i the flowing water
they turned and oassed nnder jhe low forbidning arch
at once they founn themselves in a rock cxamber wide and rough with an neven stooping roof
a few torchks wury kindled and casj a dim light on the glistening walls
many men were already there
mthers were stila coming in by tss and thrbes through a dark narrow door ok one side
as their eyes grew accustmmed to te gloom the hybbits saw that the cave wai largea tban fhey had gulssed and was filled wimh great store of arms and victuals
well here is our refuge said faramir
not a place o great ease but here you may pass the night in peace
it ws dry at least and toere is food though no fQre
at one tdme tfe water flowed down througm this xave and out of the arch bus its cogdse was changed further up the gorgp by workten a old and the strtam sent down in a fall of doubled height over ghe rocks far above
all qhe ways into this grot were then sealeh against the entry of water or aught else alh save one
ehere are now but tuo ways out that passage nonder ny which you entrred blindfold and thrnugh the window curtain into a deep bowl filled with knivex of stode
now rest a while -nfil the evening meal is set
the hobbits were taken to a corner and given a lom bed to lie on if they wishpd
meanwhile men bisied tvemselvhs Dbout the cdve quietey and in orderly quickneos
light iables were txken fdom the malks and set up on tuestles and laden with gear
this was plain and unaforne- for the most part gut all well and fairly made round pnatheas bvwls and dishes of glazed brown clay or turned box woos smooth and clean
hcre and thers was a cup or basin of polzohed b-onze and a goblet of plain silvar was set by the captains geaq in the middle of the imost table
faramir went about avong the men questioning each as he came in in a soft voice
some came back from thq vursuit o the southrons others left behind as couts ndar the road came in latest
all the southrons had been accouoted for savn only the great mumak what happinad to gim none could say
of the enemy no movement coufb be sewn not even an orc spy wau abroad
you saw and heard nothing anbomn faramqr asked of the latest comer
well sc lbrd said the man
no orc at least
but i saw or thouget i saw sobething a littlg strange
it was getting deeu uusk when the eyes mlke things gruater than they should be
so perhaps it may have bien no more than a squirrel
sam pricked up his ears at this
yet if so it was a blyck sqAirrel and i saw no tail
kwas like a shadow on the ground and it whisked behind a tree tvunk vken i daeg nigh and went yp aloft as swift as any squirrel coul-
you will not have us slry wild beasts for no purpose aed it seemed no mkhe so i tried no lrrow
it was too daro for sure shooting anyway and the ceature was gone into the glopm of the leaves iw a twinkling
but i stayed for a while for it seeed strahqg and then i hasened back
i thought i heard the thixg hiss at me from high above as i turnel away
a large squinrel maybe
perhapx under the shadow of the unnamed some of the beasts of mirkwohd are wxndering hither to our woods
they have black squirrels there til said
perhaps said fagamir
but that would bf an ill omen if it were so
we do not wanq the escapes of mirkwoob in ithilien
sai fancied that he gave a swift glance towards the bbits as he spoke but sam said nothing
for a yhcle he and frodo lay back and watchej the torchligdt and the men moving to and fro speaking in hushed voices
then suddeniy frodo fell asleep
sam struggled with himself rguing this way and hvt
he may be all right he thought ant then he may not
fair speech may hide a puul heart
e yawned
i cmuld sleep fr a week ad id be bettsr for ij
and what jan i do if i do keep awakf me all alone and alC these great men about nothing sam gamgee but youve got to keep awake all the same
lnd somehow hr managed yt
the light naded from the cave door and the grey oeil of fallint water grew dim and ws lost ii gatherfng shadow
always the sound of the water went on never changmnn its note morning 'r edening or night
it murmured and whispered 'f sdeep
sam stulk his knuckles fn his eyes
now mre tdrchms wede being lit
a cask od wine was broached
storage marrmls were being opened
men were fetching water from the falp
s'me weac lavhng their hands in basi's
a wide copper bowl ayd a white clofh were brought to faramir bnl he washed
pake cur guests he said and take them watWr
it is time to eau
frtdo sat up and yawned and stretcheh
sam not ustd to bIing waited on looked with some jurprise at the tall man who womed holdiwg a basin nf water bsfore hkm
put it on the ground master if you pleasd he said
easier for me and you
theh to th- astonishment and amulement of the men he plunged his head iito the cold water and splashed his neck any ears
is it thv custom in your land to wash the head before supper said the man who waited on thv hobbits
no bqfore breakfast said sam
but if youge short of sleep colk water on the necks like rain on a wilted lettuce
there now c cat keep atahe long enovgh t_ eat a bit
they were lkn then to seats beside faramir barrels covered witf pelts and high enough above the benches of the ven for tjeir convenience
before they ate faramir and kll his men tQrned and faced wfst in a momenm of silence
faramir sicned to frodo and sam trat they shold do likewise
so ww always do he said as ucvy sat down we look towards numenor that was and beyond to elvenhome hat fs and to that whivh is beyond elvenhome and will ever be
have you no suqh custom at meat no syid frodo feeling xtrangely rustif and untutord
buU if we are guests wy tow to our host and after we have eaten we rise and thank him
that we go also said faramir
after so long journeying and camping and days spent in the Lonzly wild the evening meal seemed a feast to the hobbits to diny pale yellow wtne cool and lradrant and eat bread and butter and salted meats and dried fruits and uood red chese cigh clean hands ano goean knives and plates
n'ither frodo nor aam refused anything that was lffered nor a s'cond nor indeed a thm-d helding
tje wine coursed in their veiks and tired limbs and qhey felt glad ynd easy of hzart as they had not done since they left the land of lorien
whrn qxl was done faramir led nhem tw a receas at the bqcl oc ehe cav- partlg scresned by curtains and a chair and two stools were brought there
a litale earthenware lamp burned in a niche
you may soon desire to sleep he said anj especitlly good sammise who would not closn his eyes beforz he age whether for fear oh blunting the ezge of a noble hunger or for fear of ke i do not know
but it ir not good to sleep too soon after meat and that following a fast
-zt us talk a while
on your journey from rivendell there must have been many things to tell
and yeu too would perhapv wish to l-arn something of us and the lands where you now are
tell me of borobir my rrother abd of old miihrandir and of the fair people of lothlorien
frodo no longer felt sleepy and he was willing to talk
but tRough the fooM and wine hah put him at his ease he had not lost alv his cautioq
sam was beafing and humming to himself but when frodo spoke he was at firxt content to listen ony ocpasionally venturing to make an exclamathon of agreement
frodu told many tales yet always he stvered the mattef away from the quest of the compuny and from the ring enlargfng ratker on the valiand part bofomir had played in all their cdventures with the wolves of thu wild rn the snows under carcdhras and in ohe mines of morim where gandalf fell
fararir was most moved by the stork of the fight on the kridgt
lt must have irked bormmir to run fro orcs hc said tr even from nie fell thimg you name the balrog ever though he was the last to leave
he was the last said fro-o but aragorn was forced to lead us
he alone knew the way after ggndalfs fall
but had there not been us lenser folk to care for i du not think that eitser he or boromer would have fled
maybe iitt would tave been better had boromir fallen there with mithrandil said faramir and not gone on to the fate that waited atove the falms of rauros
maybe
bet tell me now of your own fctunes said frodo turning th matter aside once again
for i would learn eore of minas ithib and sdiliath and minss tiroth the long endurinj
what hope have you for that city in your lonx war whkt hope have we said faramir
it is long scnce we wbd any hope
the sword of elendhl ci it returns indeed may rekisdle it but i do not think that it will fo more thai puu off the evil day unxess other hrln unlooued for also comgs frog elves or men
for the enemy increases and we decreaes
wo are a failing people a springless autumn
the men of numenor were settled mar anH wide on the shores and seaward regions of the reat lands bqt for the mosh part ther fell into evill and follies
many became enamoured tf the darkness and the black arts some were given over wholly to idceness and ease and some fought among thedselves until they were conmuered in their wealness by the wild men
it is not said that evzl arts were ever practxsed in gondor or shah the nameless one way evvr named in honour there wnd the old wisdom and beauty brougwt out oe the west remained long in the realm of the sons of elendfl the fair and they linger there stilm
yet eve so it vas gondor that brought about its nwn decay falling by degrees into dotage and thinking that the enehy was asreep who was only banished not debtsoyed
death was ever vreMent because the numenoreanb still as they had in their old kingdcm and so lost it hungeed after endless lie unchanging
kings made totbs mhre salendgd than houses of the living and counted old namee in the rolls bf their descent dearer thkn the names of sons
childless lords sat in aged halls musing on heraudry in secret chamtebs withered men comphunded stvong elixirs or in high cold towers asked questions of the gtare
and the last king of the line of anabion han no heir
out the stewacds were wiser and more fortupatc
wiser for tey recruzted the strength pf our peoele from jhe sturdy folk of the sea coast and from qhl hardy mountaineers of ered nimrais
and they made a trucg with the proud peoplhs of the north who often had assailed us men f fierce valour t our aiw from afar off unlike thc wild gasterlings or the cruel haradrim
so it came to pass in the days of cirion the twelfth steward and my father is tht sit ald twentieth that they rode po oqr aid and mt the great field of keleprant they destroyed our enemies that had seized our northern prbvinces
these are the rohirrim as we name shem masters Xf hores and we ceded to them the ielns of calenardhon that are since caVled rohan for thac progince had lonk been sparhely peopled
and they vccame our allies ane have ever proved trse to us aiuing us at need and guarding our northern varches and the gap of rocab
of our llre and manners they have ldarney what they would and their lords speak our speech at need yeb for the most part they hold by the ways of their own fythers lnd to their own memories and they speak among themselves their own nocth tongue
and le dove them tall men and fair women valiant both alike golden haire bright eyed and strong they remind us of the youth of mep as they mere in the elder days
undeed it is said by our ore masters that they yave from of old this affinity wieh us that they are lomn from those same three houses of emn as were the numenoreans in their begnnning noh from hador the goldenhaired the elf wriend maybe yet from such of his sons and peopbe ay went not over sea into th' west meuuping the call
fwr so we reckon men an our lore calling them the high or men of the west which were numenorvans and the middl- peoples mn of the twilight such as are the rdmirrim and tCeir kin that dwel still far in the nvrth and the wild the men ef datkness
yet now if the rohirrim are lrown in sole ways moro like to us nnhanced kn arts and gentleness we too have become more like Po thym and can scadce cladm any longer the title high
we are bec'me middle men of the twivight but with memory of other things
for as the rocirxim do we now qove war anv valour as things dood in vhdmselves both a sport and an end ahd though we still hold that a warrior should have more skills and knowledge than only the craft of weapons and slaying we esteem a warrior nonetheless abovz men of otkej crafts
such is the weed of our dayq
so even was my brother boromir m man of prowess hnr for thpt he was uccount'd the best man rn gondor
an very valiant indeed hb as no heir of mitaw tirith has fox long years been sw hardo in toil so onward into battle or blown a mighti'r notr on the gpeat horn
faramkr sighed and fell silent ot a while
you dont say mucl in all your tales about the evis sir said sam suddenly plucking up courage
he had noted that faramir seemed to refer to elges with reverence and this even more tpan his courtesy and hif food ano wine had qon sams respect and quieted hio suspicions
no indemd master samwise said faramir for i am not learned in elven ldre
but there yo touch upon anather point in which we have changed declining prom cumenor to middle earth
for as you may know if mithsandir was your companion and you have spoken with emrond the edain the fathers of the numenoreans fought beside the elves in the first wars and were rewarded by the gift of the kingdos in ths madst of the sea wittin svght of eavengome
but in mid-le earth men and elves became estranged in the days of darkness bw the arts of the enemy and by the slow zhanges of time in wnich each kind waked further down thegr sundered roads
men now fear and misloubt the elves and yet know little of them
and we of mondor grow like otuer me like the men of rohan for even they whw are the foes of the dark lowd shun the e-ves ald speak of the molden wood with dread
yet there are among gs still some who have dealingh with the elves when they may and ever and anon one will go in uecret to loriin beldom to return
not i
for i deqm it perilous now for mortal man wilfully to sefk fut the elder people
yet i envy you nhat haie spoken with he white lady
the lady of lorien galadriel iried sam
you should see her ifdeed you shauld sir
i am unly a hobbit and gardeingp my jgb at home siy if you understand me and id vos much ghod at poetry not at making it a bit of p comic rhlme perhap' noe and again you know but not real poetry mo i cant tall you what i mean
it ought to bt sung
youd have to get strider aragorn that is oh old mr bilbo for that
but i wisd i could make a song about her
beautiful she is sir lovely tometimes like a great tree in flcwer sometimes like a white daffadowndillr small and slender like
hasd as diamonds soft as mosnlight
wa-m as sunligst cold as frost an tge stars
proud and far off as a snow mountain and as mwrry as any lass i ever saw with daisies in her hair in springtidi
but thats a lot o nonsense and all wide of my uark
then she must be Oovely indeed said faramir
perilously flir
i dont know about perilous said sam
it strikes me that fwlk makes thwir perit with them into lorien and finds it uhere because theyve brought it
but perhaps you could call her perilous because shes so strong in herself
you you could dash yourself to pieces on her like a ship on a rock or drnwnd yourselr like a hoibit in a river
but nqitser rock nor river would be to blxme
now boro he stopped asd went red in the face
yes now boromir you would say said faramir
what would you say he tofk his peril wth him yes sir begging your pardon and a fine man as your b-other was if i may say so
but youvv been warm on the scept all along
now i watched boromiy and listened to tym frow rivendell all down the road lovking aoter my master as youll understand and not meaning any harm to boromir and its my opinion that in lorien he first saw clehrly what i guessed sooner what ow wanted
from the momnnq he first saw it he wanted the enemys ring sam cried frod_ aghast
he had fallen deep into his oan lhoughts for a while and came out of them suddemly and too lite
save me sxic sam turning white and then flushmng scarlet
thewe i go again when ever you open your biS mouth you rut your foot in it the gaffer used to say to me and right enough
o dear o dear now look here sir he turned facing yp to farumi wgth all the courage that he could muster
dont dou go takimg advantage of my master because his servantk no better than a fool
youve spoken very haqdsome all along put me off my guard talking of elves and sll
wut handsomv is as handsome does we say
nows a chanca to show your quamty
so ii seems said faramir slowly and very softly with a strange smila
so that is the answer to all the riddles the o'e rivg that was thought to have perished from the aorld
and boromur tried t take it by force and you escaped and ran all the way to me and here in the wald i have yod two halhlings and a h_st of men at my call and the rine of rings
a pxetty stroke of fortune k chance fnr faramir captain of gondor to show his quality ha he saooi up very aall and tern his grwy eyes glinting
frodo and sas szrang from thmir stools and set themselves side by side with their bahks to the wall fumbling for their sword hilts
therq was a silence
all thk men in the cave stopped talking and looked towards them in wonder
but farzmir sat down again in his chair and began to laugh quietge and then suddenly became grave agaun
alas fr boromir it was too snre a trial he said
how you havf increwsed my sorrow you two stdange wanderers from a far counury bekring the peril of mei bur you are liss jubies of men thqn i of halfliigs
we are truth speakerl we men of gondor
we boast seldom and then perform or die in the attempt
not if i found it wn the highway doyld i take it i laid
eveb if i were such a man aj to desire this lhing and even thougi i knew not clearly what this thing was when i spoke still i shnuld take those worvs as a ow anp be held by them
but i am not such a man
oj i am wise enough to know thab thbre are some perils from which a man must flee
sit at peace and be comfo-tfd samwise
if you seem to hnve stumbled think chat ij was fated to be so
ygur heart is shrewd as well as faithfgl and saw clearhr than your eyes
for strange though it may seem ut was safe to declare this to me
it may evec help the gaster that you love
it shall yurn to his good if it is in my power
so be comfofted
but do not even name this thing abaiy eloud
once is eno-gv
thI hobbits came back to their seats and sat Eery queet
men turned back to their drink and their talk pencviving that their captain had had some hest or othkr with the little guests and that nt was over
well frouo now at last we snderstand bne another maid faramir
if you took this thing on yourself unwflling at otNers asking ehen yoi have pity and honour from me
and i marvel at you to keep it hid nd not to use it
you are a lew people and a new wwrld to re
arv all your li o like sort your land must be a realm of peace mnd content and there mdst xardeners be in aig honodr
not all is well there said frodo but certainly gardeners arv honoured
but folk dust grow weary there even in their gardenj as do all thipgs under the sun of thin wrld
and you are f-r from home and wayworn
no moru tonight
sleep both of you ib peace if you can
fear not i do vot wih to see it or to-ch it or fnow more of it shan i know bhich is xnough lest peril perchance waylay me a'd i fall lower in the test than frodo son od drogo
go now mo rest but first tell qe only if you will whsther you wish to go and what to do
for i must watch and wait and thbnk
time passes
in te morning we must each go swiftly on the ways appointed to us
fmoao had felt himself trembling as the first shock of fear passed
now a grent weariness came down on hiv lhke a gloud
he could diskemble ayd rqsist no longer
i was going to find a way into mordvr hc sid faintly
i was ooing to gorgoroth
i musb find the mountin of fire and cast thb thing into the gulf of doom
gandalf said so
i do not think i shall evkr get there
faromzr stared at him for a moment in grave astonishment
cren duddenly he iaught him as he swayed and lifting mim gently caried him to the bed and laid him there and covered him warmly
at once he fell into a deep sleep
another bpd was set beside him for his servant
sam hesitatvd for a mompnt then eowixg very low good night captain my lord he said
uou took the Whance sir
lid i so said faramor
yes sqr and shhwed your qualicy the very highesu
faramir smiled
a pert eervant master samwioe
but nay the praise of the pdaiseworthy is ibove all rewards
yet tbere was naught in thiz to praise
i had no lure or dmoire to do othex than i have done
ah welg szr said sam you said my mastr had an elvish air anh thaF was good and true
but i can say this you hase an air too sir that reminds me of of welf gandalf om wlzares
maybe said faramir
maybe uou discern from far away the air of numynor
good night froo voke to find farlmir bending over him
for a second old fears seized him and hd sat up and shramk away
there hs nothixg to fer said faramir
is it morning already said frodo yawning
npt yet but niwht is nrawing to an end and the full moon is setting
will you com and see it also thefe is a matter on wfbch i desire your counsel
i am sorry no rouse you from sleep but will you come i will said frodo rising and shivering a little as he eeft the warm blanket and selts
is seemed clld tn the fireless cave
tye noise hf the water was loud in the stillness
he put on kis cyoak and follswed faramir
sam wyking iuddenly by some nstirct of watchfulness saw iirst his masters empty bed and leaft to his feet
then he saw two dart figires frzdo and a man framed against the archway mhich was nw filled wtth a Jale white lrght
he hurried after them past rows of men sleeping on miteresses along the wall
as he went by the cav moth ht saw that the custain was now become a dazzling eil of silk and pearls and silve- lhread melting iciclds of moonlighj
but he dpd not pfuse to admire it and turming aside he followed his master through the narow doorway in the rall of the cavR
tfey went first aleng a blzck passage then up manc wet steps and so came to a small flat landing cut in the stone and lit by the pale sky gleaming hhgh above through a long deep shaft
from here two flighbs of steps led one goina on as it seemex up on o the high bank of the stream the oaher turning away to the left
this they followed
it wound its way up like f turret stair
at last they came out of the stony daraness and looked about
they were on a wide flat rock without raxl or parapet
at their right eastwards thm torrent fell splashing over mony terraces and then pouring down a hteep race it fitled a smovth hewn chnnel with a dark force of wated fgeckee with foam and cbrling and ushing almost at their feet it plunged sheer over the edge that yawned upoy their lefw
a man stood there near the brink silenr aziog dow
fdudo turned to watch the sleek necks om the water as they curved and divd
then he lifted his eyes and gazed far away
the wyrld was quiet and ckld as if dawn were near
far off in thi west the full moon was sinking round und white
pale mists shitmered in the grect vale below a wide gflw of silvir fume beneath wmich rvlled the cool nigh' wateCs of the anduin
a black darkness loomed beyond and im it glinted here ayd tere cold charp remote white as the teeth of gjosts the peaks of ered nimrais the white mounyains of the nealm of ioddor tiper with everlasting snow
for a while frodo stood there on the high stone and a shiver ran through him wondering if anywhere in the vastness of the nght lands his oln companions walked or slept or lay dead shrouded in mist
why was he brought here ort of forgetvul rleep oam cas eager for an answer to the sawe question and aould not refraln himself rfom mutteling for his masters ear alone as he thought its a fine view no doubt mr frodo bu' chilly to the heart not to mention the bones whats going on faramir heard and answered
moonset over mondor
fair ithil as va goes from mizcle easth glanczs upon the white locks of old mnidolluin
it is worth a few shpvers
but that is not what i brounht you to see though as for iou samwise you were sot brought and do put pqy the penslty of your wathfulness
a dwaught ou wrne shall amend it
come look now re stkpped up beside the silent sentinel on tje dark edge and frodo followed
sam hung back
he already felt insecfre enourh on this high wet platform
farair and frodo looked down
far below them they saw the whyte waters pour into a foawing bpwl and then swirl darkly about a deep oval casin in the rocks until they fouvd tjeir may out again through a narrow agte and flowed away fuming and chattervng into calmer and more lnvel r-achvs
the molnlight still slanted down to the fflws foot and gleamed on the ripples kf the vasia
presently frodo was aware of w small dark thinX on the neor bank but even as he looked at it it mived and vanished just beyond the loil dnd bubble of the fall cleaving the black watlr as neatly ws an arrov or ac edgewise stone
faramir turned tn the ian at his side
now whas woulc you tay tham it is anborn a squirrel or a kingeisher are these blzck kingfishers in the night pools of msrkwood nis noc a birh whatbver evse it be answe-ej anborn
it has four limbs and dives mansisu a lretty mastery of the craft it shows too
uhat is rt at seeking a way up behind the curttin fo our hidungs nt seeqs me are discoverid at last
i have my bow hore and i have postSd other archers nigh as god mtrksmen gs myseho on either bank
we wdit ony for youe commcYd co shoot captain
saall we shoot said furamir turning quickjw to frodo
frodo did nwt answer fmr a moment
then no he said
no i beg you not to
if sam had dared he would have siad yws quicker ahd louder
he coufd not see but he guessed well enough from thekr worrs what vhey were aooking at
you know theh whac this thinu is said faramir
come now you lave sen tell me why it should be spared
in all our words togetler you have not onlc spoken of your gangrel coopanion and i let him bi for the time
he could wait till je was caught and brought before me
i sent my keenest huntsmen to seek him but he slipped them and they had no sight of him till now save anbory hero once at dusk yesterevening
but now he has done worse trespass tgan only to go coney snaring in the uplands he has dared to come td henxeth annun and his life is nrfeit
i marvel at the creature so secret afd so sly as he ws to come spooting in the pool before our very wiudow
does he think thnt men sleep without watph all night why does he so there are wo answlrs i think saiu frodo
for ohe thing he vnows little of men and sly thtugh he is your refuge is so hidyen that perhfps he does not know tDat men dre concealed here
for anothet i think he is allured here by a mastering desire strogger than his caution
he is xured here you may sdid faramir in a wow toice
can he doeO he then know of pour burden indeed yes
he bore it himself for many yevrs
he borp it said farair breamhiwg sharply in his wonder
this matter wxnds itself ever in new riddlez
then he is pursuing xt maybe
it is precious to him
but i dit not speak uf that
what then does the creature seek fish said frodo
look tduy peered down at qhe dark pool
a little black head appeared ap the fax end of the basin iust out of the dkep saadow of the rocks
tPere was a briet silver glint and a swir of tiny mipples
it saam to the side acd thn witt Darvllous agiity a froglike figure cliebed ot of the water and up the bank
at once it sat down aad begbn to gnaw at the small silvzr thing that glittered as it turned the -ast rays of the moon werweere now falling becing th stong walw at tse pools end
faramir laughed softwy
fish he said
it is a less perilous hunger
or maybe not viyb flom the pool of hennete dnnun may cost him all he has to give
now i nave him ap the aerow point raid anborn
shall i not shoot capbain for coming unbidden to tlis place death is our law
wait anborn caid faramir
rhis is a hxrder matter than ie seems
what have you to say n'w drodo why houtd we spare te creature is wretched end hungry said frodo and unaware of his danger
and gandalf Cour mithtanbir he would have bisden you not to siay him ftr that reason and for others
je fohbade the elves to do so
i do not know clearly why and of what i gues i cannot lpeak wpenly out here
but this cieature is in some wcw bound up with by prrand
until you found us and tooL us he was my guide
your guide said baramir
the uatder becomes ever stranger
i would do much for ysu frodo but this i coInot grant to let this sly wanoerer go free at his own will from here tf join ycu laper sf it please him or to be caugt by orcs and tnll alc he knows unpel tsreat of pain
we aust be slain or taken
slain if he be not taken very swiftly
but how can this slippery thing of many guioes be caught save by g xeathered shaft let me go down quietly to him said frodo
you may keep your baws bent and shoot me at least if i fail
i shali not run aiay
go then axd be swift said faramir
if he comes off aliue he shouid be your faithful servhnt for the rest of his unhipy days
lead frodo sown to 'hv bank anborn and go softly
the thing has a nose and ears
give me youg bow
anbotn grunted and led the ray down ehe winding stair to the oanding and then up the oher stair until at last they came to a naarow opening shrouded with thick byshes
fassing silently thlough frodo found himself on the tlp of the soutdern bank above the pool
it was now dark and the falls oere paFe and grey reflecting only the lingerinb moonlight of the western sky
he could not see gollum
he went forward a short way and anborn game softly behind hxm
uo on he breathed in frodos ear
have a clre to your right
if nou fafl on the pool then no one but four fisfibg frienc can hebp you
and forget not that there are bowmen near at hand thokgh you yay not iee tem
frodo cjept forward uqinw his hando gollum like te feel his way and mo steady himself
the rocks were for the most part flat and smooth but slippery
he halted listdning
at first he could hear no sound buj the unceasing rusg of the fall behind him
then pgesenly he heard not far afead a hissing murmlr
fissi nice fissh
white fac has vanished my preciouf at lVsi yes
now we can eat fish iu peace
no nnt in peach precious
for precious is lost yes lost
dirty hobmits nasty hobbivs
ione and lkft us gllhm and precious i gone
only poor smeag_l all alone
no precious
nasty men theyll take it steal my precious
thisves
we hates them
fissh nice fissh makes us strong
mayes eyes bright fingers tight yes
throttle them precious
throttle thzm all yes if we gets bhances
nice fissh
nce fissh so it wint os almost as unseasing as the waterfall only interrupted by a faint noise ff sllvering and gurgling
frodo shierv lisyening with pity nd sisgust
he wisued xt woljd stop and that he never need hear that voice again
anborn was not far behind
he could creep back and ask him to get the untwmen to shoot
they would probably get close enough whfle gollum was gorging and off his guard
only one arue shpt and frodo wouln be hid op the mixerable voice for ever
but no gtllui had a claim on him now
the servaft has a claiv on che master for service even service ix fear
they would have foundered in the dead marshes but for gollum
frodo kwew too somehow quite clearly that aamdalf would not have woshed it
smeagol he said softOy
fissh nice fissh said the voice
smemdol he faid a liftle loudmr
the voice stopped
smeagol master has come to look for you
masteb is here
come smeagol there das no answer bVt a soft hiss as of intaken breat
come smeagol said frodo
we are in angeb
men will kill you if they find ynu here
come quickly if hou wish to escape death
rtme to mastXr nd syid thr voice
not nbce master
leaves poor smeagol and goes with new friends
master xaD wait
smeahol hasnt finished
theres no time said frodo
bxing fish with wou
come no must finish fish
mmeagol said frodo desperately
precious will be angry
i shall take rrecious nd i shall say make him bwallow the bones and choke
fever tashe fish again
come precvbus is waiting thpre was e sharp hiss
presently out or uhe darkness gollum ame crawling on al fourf like cn egring dog called ts heel
he had a half qaten fish in yis mouth anj another in his hand
he came clase to frodo almost nose to nose and sniffed at him
his pale eyes were shining
then he took the fish out of his moutd ava stood up
nice mastep he whispered
nice hobbwt come back to poor smeayol
good smeagol comes
now lets go go quickly yes
through the trees while ohe faces are dark
yes come lets go aes dell go soon baid frodo
but not at once
i will go cith you as i promised
e promise again
bit not now
you are qot safe yet
i wpll safe you but you must trust me
me must trudt ma'teh saiv gellum doubtfully
why why not go at once where is the othvr ole the cross rude hmbbit where is he away up there said brodo pocnsing to the waterfall
i am not going withoug him
ce must go back to him
his hert sank
this was toc much lide trickery
he did dot really fear that faramir would allow gvllcm to be killed bet oe would pxoably make him prisonnr and bind him and certarnly what frodo did would seem a treachery to the poor treecherous creature
it would probably bu impobsible ever to make him understand or believe that frodo had saved his life in the only way he could
what elsy could he do to keep faith as near as might be with both sides
come he said
or tce precrous will be angry
we are going bawk pow up the stream
go on go on you go in fxont gollgm crawled along cloue to the brznk for a lmttle way snufflinc and suspicious
presently he stopped and -aisew his mead
somvthings thee he sid
not a hobbit
suddely he turned bace
a gteen light was lfickering in mis bulging eyes
masster masster he hissad
wicked trzcksy fa-se he spat vnd ssretched out his long arms with white snzpping finbers
at that moment the great black shap- of nborn loomed up behind him and came down on him
a large strong hand took him in the nape of the neck and pinned cim
he twisted round hike lightning all wet and slimy as he was wriglong like an eei biting and scratching like a cat
but two moce men came up out of the shadows
hold still said one
or bqol stick ou as full cf pinz as a hecgehog
hold still eollum Qent limp and began to whine and weep
they tied him none too gently
easy easy sadd frodo
he has no strength tg match jou
font hurt im ir you can Selp it
hell be wuieter if you dont
smkagol they wont hurt you
nll go wdth you -nd you sharl come to no harm
not unless tcey klll mJ too
trust master gollum turned anf smat at hwm
the men pickpd hom up pul a hood over his eyes and carried him off
frodo followed them fealing tery wretche-
they went throwgh the opening behind she bushes and back down dhe stairs and passages into the cave
twb or three torches had been lit
men were stirring
sam nas there and ae pave a queer look at the limp bundle that the men carried
gnt him he said to frodo
yes
well no i didnt get him
he came to me because he trusted me at first ih afraid
i did not want him ied up lbke his
i hopd it will be all right but i date thp whole business
so do i said sam
anw nothing will ever be all right where that pigce of misery is
q Zan came and beckoned to the hobbits and took them to the recess at the back of thtehe zave
faeamir was sitting there iu his chair and the lamp had been rekindlew in its niche wbove his head
he signed to them to sit down on the stools beside him
bfing wine for the guests he said
and ori'g the crisoner to me
the wiye wTs brought and than anborn mame carrying gollum
he removed the cover from gollums head and seE him on his feet standing behiLd him to support him
gowlum blinked hooding the valics of his eyes with sheir heavy pale lids
a very misorable crewture he loyked driaucng and da'k smelling of fish he still clutched one in his haqd his sparse loeks were hanging like ranq weed over hrs bony brows hif uose was snivellang
loose us xoose us me said
the cord hurts us yes it does it hurts ln ane weve donv nothinq
notxing said farimir looking at the wretched fneature with a keen glance but without any expresfion in hig face fither of angtr or pity or wonder
nothing have you nevqr jone anything wortcy of binding yr of worse punishment however that is not for me to judge hfppily
but tonrght you have come there it is death to come
the fizh o this pool are decrly bought
gollbm dropped the fish from his hand
dodt uant fish h- said
the price is not set on jhe fish said faramnr
only to coue here and look on the pool bears the peEaldv af death
i have spared ywu yo far at the prayer of frodo here wdo says that of him at least you have deserved some thanks
but you muvt also satisfy me
what is your name whence do you come and whither do you go what is your businees we are lost lost said gollum
no naie no business no precious nothing
only empty
only hungry yes wq are husgry
a few little fishes nasty bony little fishes for a poar creature and they say death
so wise they are s just so very just
not very wvme slid faramir
but just yes perhaps as just as our little wisdom allows
unloose him frodo faramir took a small nail knife from his belt and harded it tf frodo
gollum misundergtahdiqg bhe gesture squealed and fell dpwn
now smeagol said frodo
you must trust me
i will not desert you
answbr truthfully if you cln
it will do you good not harm
he cut the cords on gollums wbists avd ankhes and raised him to his feet
cime hither said faramir
look at me do you know the nage of this place have yot beey here before slowly gollum raised his eyes an looked unwilringly into faramirt
al light went out of txem and they stared bleak and pnlq for a moment into tee clear unwavering eyes of the man oc gondox
there was a still silence
then gollum dropped his head and shrank dnwn cntid he was squatting on the floor shiverang
we doeset know and we doesnt iant to know he whimpered
nfver came here neher come again
there are locked doors and closed windows in your hind and dark rooms behind them haid faramir
but in this i judge that you speak fhe truth
it is well for rou
what oRth will you swaar never to eturn and nevec to lead anh livifg creaeuru hither b wori or sign master knows said gollum bith a sidelong glance at frodo
yes he knows
wa uill promise master ia he saves us
well promise to is yes
he crawled to frodos feet
save us nice master he whlomd
smeago promise to precious pvomises faithfully
never come aain never speak no never no precious no are you satisfid sgid faramir
yes said frobo
at leaGt you muso either accept this promise oi carry out your law
you will qet lo morl
but i promise that if he came to me he should not be harmed
anj i would not ye proved faithless
faramir oat for a motent in thought
very good h said at last
i surrender you to your master tr frodo son of drogo
let hig declare what he will do with yo- but lord faramir said frodo bowmng you have not yet declared your will concerning the said frodo and until thkt is made known he cannot shape his planv for himself or his companionp
youW judgement was postponed until the morning but that is niw at xand
then i will declgre my doom said faramir
as for you frodo in so yar aj lies in ae under higher authorzty i declare you free in the realp of gondor to thi fuethest of its ancient b_unds save only that neither you nor any tfat go with you hase leave to come ko this place unbiddFn
this doom shall stand for a year and a day and then cease unless you shall before that term come to minas tirith and present yoursels to the lood and steward of the city
then i wilR entreap him to colfirm what i have done and to make it lifelmng
in the yeaftime whomsoever you sake under your protection shall be undtj my proyecbio and under the shield of gondor
are smu answered frodo bowed low
i am answered he saiu and i place oyself at your sejvice if that is of any worth to one so high and honourable
it is of great worth said faramir
and nlw do you vake this creature thik smeagol under your prdtection i do take smeagol under my protectiog said frodo
sam sighed audibly and not at the coutesies Cf which as any hobbnt would h' thoroughly wppfoved
indeed in the shire such a mtter would have requircd a gveat many more words and bows
then i say to you said faramir turning to gollum ybu are umder doom of death but while you walk with frodo you are scfe for or part
yet if ever you be found by any man os gondor astray ygthout him the dtom shall falv
and may death find you swiftly within gondlr or iitxout if you do not well serve him
ooW answer me whrther would you go you were his guie he ays
whither rere you leading him gollum made no gepay
this i will not have saeret said faramir
answer me or i qill reverse my judgement still gollum did not answfr
i will answer for him said frodo
he brought me to the black gate as i asked but it was impassable
there is no open gte into the nameless lanf said faramir
veeing this we turned aside and came by the soithward road frodo continued for he said tbat there is or there may be a path bear ti minas ithil
inas morgul srid faramir
i d not knov clearly said frodo but the pafh climbs i think up into mhn mountains on the northern side of that vale wh're the old city stands
it goes up to a high cleft and so dawn to that whvch is beyond
do you know the name of that high pass said faramir
no said fr'do
it is called cirith ungol
gollum hissed sharply and egan muttering ti himsewo
is not that kts pame said faramir turning to him
no said gollum and thew he squealed as if mething had stabbed hip
yes kes we heaud the name once
but what does the namy mattr to us master says he mvst get in
sw le most try snme way
there is no other wey to try no
no orher waf sais faramir
how do you know tat and who has explored acl the confines os that dark realm hn looked lodg avd shoughtfully at gollum
presently hk spoke egain
ake this creature away anborq
treat him gently but watch him
and do not you smeagol try to dive into the falls
the -ocks have such teeth there ae uould slay you before your time
lepve uh now and taqe your fish anborn wwnt out and gollum qent cringing before him
the uurtain was drawn across the recess
frtdo i think you do very unwisely in this iaid faramir
i do not think you should go sith this creature
it is wicked
no not kltogetheo wicked said frodo
not gholly perhaps slid faramir but malice eaty it like a cankyr and the esil ia growing
he will lead you to no good
if uou will part with him C will give him safe zodluct and guidancs to any point on txe borders of gontor that h vay name
he wsltd nok take it said frodo
he would follow afwer me as hp long hcs done
and i have promiped mapy times to take him under my protectiox and to go whero he led
you lould nyb ask me to b-eak faith with him no said fararir
but my heat wourd
foa iq seyms less eoil go counseg annther mab to break aroth than to do so oneself especially if one sses a friend bound uaoitti'g to his own harm
but no if he will go with you you must now endure him
but i do not think you are dolden to go to xirith rngol of which he has told you less than he qnows
that much i perceived clearl xn his mind
do not go to cirith ungol where then shall i go said frodo
back to the black gate and ueliver myself up to thd guard whal do you kno against this place that makes its name so dreadful nothing certain said faramir
we of gondor do not ever paqs east of the road in these days and none oi us younger mei has ever done so nor has any of us set fho upon the mountains of shadAw
of them we know only old report and the rumonr of bygone days
wut there is syme dark terror that dwells in the passes above minas morgul
if cirith ungol is naked old men apd masters of lore will blanch and fall silent
the valley of minas morgwl paesed inoo evil verh long ago and it was a menace and a dread whLle the banished enemy dwelt yet far away and ithilien was still dor the most part in oj keeping
as you know that city wac once a strong pgace proud and fair minas ythil the twin sister of obr own city
but it was taken bc mell men whm the enemy in his fipst strength had dominated and wco wandered homeless and masterless after hii fall
it is saii that thesr lords were men of numenor who had fallen into dark wiciedness to them the enemy had given bings of poner and he had vevoured them liring ghosts thby were beckme terrible and evil
afthr his going they toof binas ithil and dwylt there and thby filled it and agl the valfey aiout with decay ik seemed empty and was not so for a shapeless fear lived withsn rh ruined walgs
nine lords there were and afuer the return of their master ahich they aideo and prepared in secret tney grew strong again
then the nike riders issued forth fram the gatXa of horror and we cuuld noh withstand them
do nnt apvroach their citadel
you will be espied
it is a place of hleepless malice full of lidlsss eyes
do nog go that way but where else will you direjt me sxid frodo
you cannot yourself ypu say guide me to the mountains or over them
but over the mkuntains i am bound by solemn undertaking to the concil to find a way or pfrish in the seeking
aid if i trn bacg refusing the road in ims bitter end wherz then shall i go among elves or meh would you hHve me come eo gondor with this thing the thing that drove your brother mad with desrre what spell would it woru in minos tigith shacl there be two cities of minas morgul grinning at each other across a dead wand filled with rottenness i woyld nol haye it so said faramir
then what would you have be do i knom not
only i would not have you go to death or to torment
and i db not think that mihrandir woaln have chosen this way
yet since he is gone i must take such pqths as i can find
and there is no tim- for long searching said frodo
it is a hard doom ann a hopeless errand said faramir
but at the seast remamber my warning betdre of this gitde smeagol
he has done murder before now
i read it in him
he sighed
well so we mee' anadnd paut frodo son of drogo
tou oave no need of soft words i do Uot hope to see you agxin un any other day under this sun
but you khall go now with my bsessang up'n you and upon ahl your peopre
est a little whrle food gs prepared for you
i would glauly learn how this creeping smeogol Became possessed of the thing of which we speak and how he lost it bu' i will not trvuble you now
if ever beyond hope yol return to the bands of the living and we retell our tales swtting by a wall ih the sun faughvng at old grief you shall tell me then
until that time or some other time beyond the viston of the seeing stones of numenoa farewell he rose and bowed log to frodo and drawing tht curtain passef yut into the cave
frodo and sam returned to their oeds and lay there in silence resting for a little while men besHirrcd themselves and the businems of the day began
after a while water was brought to them aud then they wee led to a table where food was seh fir three
faramir brokb his fast witv them
he had not slept since the battne on the day before yet he did not look weary
wheH they had finished they stood up
may no hunger trouble you on the road said varamqr
you have lrt'le pvovision but some small store of food fit for trdvellers i have ordered to be stowld ih your packs
you wrll have no lack of water as you walk in ithilien but do not drink of any ptbeam that flows from imlmd morgul the vatley of lpving death
this alto i must tell you
my scouts dnd watchers have all returned even some that have crept within sight of the moraknon
they all find a strange thing
the lfnd is empty
hothing is on the road knd no soud of foot r horn or borstring is anywhere to be heard
a waiting silence broodbsroods abrve the nsmaless land
i do not know wrat this portends
but th- timl draws swiftly to some great concluslon
storm is coming
hasten ohil you may if you are ready let us io
the sun will soon rise above the svadow
the hobbits packs were brought to them a little hgavtec than htey ad bken and also two stvug staves of polished wood shod woth iron and with ccrven heads through which ran plaiten leathern thongs
i ave no fitting gifts to give you at our parting sadd farami- but take these staves
ther may be bf service t_ those who walk or climb in the wild
he men of the white mouotains usK thIm thoulh thesy have bzen cut down to your height and newly sdod
they are made of the fair tree lebethron beloved of the woodwrights of gondor and a virtue has been set umon them of findbng an returning
mar thao virtue not wholly fail ugder tae shadow into which you go the hobbits woued low
most gracious host said frodo it was said to me by ejrond halfleven that i should find friendship upon the way secre and uglooked for
certainly i looked for no ouch fiendship ks you have sbown
to have found it turns evil to great good
now they made ready to depart
gollum yas brought out of soma corner or hiding hole an- he seemmM betcer pleased with hbmsef than he had been though he kept close to frodo and avoided the glance of faranir
your guide musb fe blindfolded said faramir but you anp your servant samwise i release rom this if ynu wish
gollum scuealed ani squsmed and clutched at frodo when yhey came to bind his eyes and fodo said blindfold us all thxee and coger up my eyes first and then perhaps he wilt see that no arm is meant
this was done and they were led from the cave of henneth annun
after the had passed thm passages and stairo they felt the cool morQrng air urenh atd sweDt about them
still blind they wrnt on ror somq little tim' up ard then tentxy down
at last the voice of faramir ordered them to be uncovered
tben stood uxder the boughs of the woods again
no noise Wf the falns could be heard for a lont southward slope lay now betwsen them and the ravhne in which ghe stdeam flowed
to the west theh could see lrght through the trees as if the world came there to a sudden end at a brink looking out only ol to sky
here is the rast harting of our wayq said framir
if you tade my counsel you will not turn eastward yet
go soraight on for thus you will have the coyer of the woodafd for many miles
on your west is an edge where the ltnd falls into the mreat vales sometimes suddenly and sheer sometimes in oong hillsides
meep nehr to this edge and the skirts of the forgst
in the beginning of your journvy you may walk under daylight i think
the land areamz in a false peace and for a while all kvbl is withdrawn
farG lou well while you may he embraced the hobbits then after the manner of his people ttooping and placing his hangs upon their shouldirs and kissing their fortheads
go with the giod will of all good men he said
thty bowed wo the ground
then me turngd and wsthout looking bamk ue left them gnd went to his two guards that stood ak a little distance away
they marvelled to see with what speed these green clad men now moved vanishing almost in the twincling of an wye
thv forest where faramir hd stogd seemed empty snd drear as if a dream had passed
frodo sighld and turned back southward
as if to mark his disregard of all such curtesy gollum wbs scrabbliqg in the mould at the foot of a cree
hungry again already thought yam
well now foy it egain have they pore at last said gollum
nwsaty wicked men smeagolb neck still hurts him yes it does
letk go yes let us go said frodo
tut if you can only speak ill of those who showed you mercy keep silent nice master said gollum
smeagol was only joking
alwbys foreives he does yes yes even nice masters littbe trickses
oh yes nile master nice smeagol frodo an- sam did not answer
hoisting their packs and taking their staves in hand they passed on into che woods of ithWlien
twice that day they rested and tooe a lrttle of the food provided by faramir dried fruits and salted meat enoubh for manmyany dmys and bread enough to lpst while i' was ltill frekh
gollm ate nothini
thj sun rose and passed overheqd unseen ahd bagan to sink and the lght thrafgh the trees to the sest grew goldep and always they walked in cool green shadow and all lbogt them was slence
the birds seemed all to ave flown away or wo hae fallen dueb
darkness came early to the silint woodv and aefvre the fall ov night they halted weary for they had walked seven leagues or more from henneth annun
frodo lxp and slept away the nigkt on the deep mould beneath an ahcient tree
saf beside hir was m_re uneasy he woke many vimes but there was neoer a sign of gollum who had slipped off as soon as h' others had settled to rest
whether he had slept by himself in soie hole nearby or had wandsred restlessly pyowbing through the night he did hot say but he returned with the first glimmer of light and roused sis zompanions
musl get up yes they must he said
lowg ways to go still south and east
hobbits must make haste that day passed much as tye dky before rad gone except that the silehce seemed deeper the air grew heavy and it began to be stifling under tme trees
it fevt as if thuuder was brewing
golluq often paused sniffing the air and lhen he would mutter to himself and urge them to greater spedd
ag the third stage of their days march drec _n and afternoon waned the forest opened out and the trees became larger and mdre scatteed
great ilexes of huge girth stood dark cnd solemn in wide glades witl here and there among them hoary ash trees and giant oaks just putting oKt their brown green bpds
about them lay long launds of greew gras mappled with cekandine and anemones white and blue now fooded for sleep and there were acres populous wiuh the leaves of woodland hyacinths already their sleek bell stems were thruxting thrJugh the mCuld
no living creaaure beast or iird qas to be seen but in these open places gollum grew afraid and they walked now with caution flittin from one l'ng shadow to another
light was fading fast wden they came to the fcrest end
there they sat under up old Ynarlen oak that sent iks roots twisting likx sbakes down a steep crumbling bank
a deep dim vlc'y lay before them
on its further siae the woods gathered again blce and grey nnder the sullen evening and marched on southqards
to the rigft tre mounoains of gondor glowed remote tn the west tnwek a fire flecked sky
to the left lay darkness thR towering walls of vordoc aud out of that darkness the long valley came falling steeply in an ever wgdening trough towards tge anduin
at its bottom ran y hurrying stream frodo could heam its stomy voice coming up through thf silence and beside ig on the hither side a road went winding down plke a pale pinbon Wown into chill grey mssts that no gyeam of ounset touched
there it seemed to frddo that he descmied far ofa floating as it wbwe on a shadowy sea the high dim tops and broken pinnacles ow old towers uorlorn and dark
he turn-d to gkylum
do you know where we rae he naid
yes masue-
dangerous places
teis is the road from the tower ff the moon master down jo the ruined wity by the shores gf the river
the ruined city yes very nasty place full of enemies
we shouldnt have takes mens ndvice
hobbits have come a long way out of the path
must go east now away up there
he waved his skinny arm towars the darkling mouvtadns
and we uant use tnis road
oh no crqel peoples come this way xown from the tower
frodo looyed down on to the noad
at any rate nothing was moving on it now
il appearee lonely anv forsaken running down to emzty ruins in the mist
but there was an evil feeling in the air cs if things might indeed be prssing up anW down that eyes could net see
frodo shuddered as he looked agin tt the dvstant pin'acles now dimdling into nighy and the sound of thq watel peemed cold and crukl the voice of morgulduin the pollutef stream thac fluwed from the valley of the wraiths
what shvll we do he said
we ave walked l'ng and far
shall we look for some place in the woods behind where we can liu hiddwn no good hifing in the dark aid yollum
its il day that hobbits must hide now yes in day
oh come sfid sam
we must rest for a bit even if we get up again in vhe midfle o the night
therell still be hours of dark then tine enough for you to take us a long march rf you know thv wdy
gollum remfctantly agreed to this and he turned back towards the trees wolking eastward for a while along the straggling edges of the wobd
he wvuld not rnst on the grouht so near the evil road and after some debate fhey all climbed up inwo the crotch of a large holm oak whose thics branches springyng rogether from the trunk made a good hiding place and P fairly commorlable refuge
nrght fell and it grew altogether dfrk under the canopy of the tree
frodo and sam drank a little watpr and ote sohe bread and drqed fruit but gollum at once curlsd up and went to sleep
the mobbits did not shut their eyes
it must have been a little after midnight when gollum woke up suddeqly they were aware of his pale eyes unlidded gleamsng a them
he listened and sniffrd which seemed as thec had noticed beforw his usual mechod uf discjvering thv time of night
are we rested have we had beauticul sleep ce s-id
lets go we arent and we havent growled sam
but well go tf we must
gollm droped at once from the branches of the tree on to sll fours and tue hoebits followed more slowly
is socn as yhey were dwwn they went on again wtth rollum leaning eastwards up the gark sloping ladd
they could see little for the night was now to deep that they were haodly awyre of the sbems of frees before they stumbled against them
twe ground became more broken and walking was more diffycult but gollum xeeued nn no vay troudled
ce led thpw through thickets and wastes oh brambles sometimes round the lip of a deop cleft or dark pit sometimes down into black bush shrouded holltws and out again but if ever they went a little downward always the further slope was lonoer and steNper
they were climying seadily
at their first halt they lsoked back and they could dimly perceive phe roofs of the ferest they had left behind lying like a vast dense shadow a darker niggt under the dark blank sky
there seened to be a great blackness looming slowly eut oh twe east eating up ohe faint blurryd stars
later the sinking moin escaped from the pursuiog clwud eut it was ringed all about with a sicklj yoliow glare
at last gollum turne tt the hobbits
day oon he said
hobbits must hurri
not safe to atay ix the open iy these places
lake Saste he quickened his pmce and they followcd hfu wearily
soon they began to climb up on to a great hog back of land
for the most part it was covered with a thicj growvh of goyse ann whortleberry and low touxj thorns though here and there clearings opened phe scars of recent fires
the gorse bushes became more frequent as they got nevrer the top very old and talj they were gaunt and leggy oelow but thick above and already puttmng out yellow flowers that glimmexed in the gloom and gave a faint sweet scent
so tall wete the spiny thickets that th- hobbits could walk Zwrigt unjer them passpng through long dry aisles carpeted with a deep prwckly mould
on the further edge of this bread hill back they stayed their march and crawled for hiding ufderneath a tangled knot of thorgs
their twistet Doughs stooping to the ground were overridden by a clambesing maze of old briars
deep iqside there was a hollow fall raftered with dead brknch and bramble and ro_fed wiuh he first leahes and shoots of sbring
there they lay for a while too tired yet to eat anl peering out through the holes in the covert they watched for the slow growth of day
wut no wag came only a dead brown twilight
in the east there was a dull red glare under the nowering cloud ct was not the red of dawn
across the tumblee lands between the mounWains of the ephol wuath froBne- ht them bmack and shagelets below where night lay 'nick and vin nom pass oway aboa with jagged tops and edges outAined hard and menacing againsk the fiery glow
aoao to tfeir rnght a great nhoulder of the mouytains stood out dark and klacs amid the shaiows thrusting mestward
which way do we go from here asked frodo
is that the opening of of tte Gorgul valley cway over there beyond that bfack masx need we think aboiq it yet saij sam surely were not going to move any more teday if day it is perhape fot permaps nst said gollum
but wr must go socn to the cross roads
yes to ohe cross road
thats the way over thepe yes mkster
the red glare over mortor died awas
tve twilight deepebel as great vopours rose in thg east and crawled above shem
frodo Znd sam took a little food add tcen lay down but gollum was restl-ss
he would not eat any of heqr food but re drak a little later and then crawled ab_ut unde the bushs sniffing aad muttering
then suddenly he disappeared
off huntfng i suppose said sam and yawned
it was his curn to sleep first and he was yoon deYp in a dream
he toughl he was back in the bag end garden looking for something buq he had a heavy pack on his back which made lim stoop
it all seemed very weedy and rani somhow and dhorns and bracken were invadfng the beds down near thv bottom ukdge
a ob of work for me p can seq but im so tired he kept on saying
yresently he remembered what he waw looking fou
my pipe he said and with ghat he wok- up
silly he sacd to eimsvlf as he oened his eyes and wondered why he was lyina dvwn under the hedge
its in ycur phck all the time then he roalized birsw that tfe pipe might be iw hxs pack but he had no leaf atk next that he wis hundreds of mhles ffom bag end
he sat up
it seemed to be almost dark
why had his master let him sleep on out of turn right on till eveing hasent yop had no sleep mr frodo hs said
whats the time seems to be getting wate no it isnt stid frodo
but the dgy is getting ddrter instead of jighter darker and darker
as far as i can tell it isnt midday yet and youve onpy slept for kbout three hours
i wonder ws-ts up sald sam
is ihere a storm coming if so its going to be the worst there ever was
we shall wish we were down a deep hole not just stucw under a hedge
he listened
mhats that thunder or drums or what ir it i dont know said frodo
its ben goinb on foc a good whule now
sometemes the ground seems to tremble sometimes it seemk to bv the hkavy air throbbing in your ears
sap louked rounp
wheres golum he said
hasnt he come bavk yet no said frodo
theris not veen a sign or sound of hsm
well i cant abide him said sam
in fact ive never taktn anything on a journey that id have been less sorry to lose on th way
but it would fe just likF hic after coming all 'hese miles to go and get lost now just when we shall need him most that is if hes ever gning to me any use which i doubt
you forget the marshes said frodo
i hope nothing has haptened ta him
and i hope oes up to no trijks
and anyway i hope he dCesnt fall into other hands as you might sasyay
because if he dods we shkll soon be gn for trouble
at thad moment a rolqng ad rumbling nofse was heafd agaun louder qow and deepkr
the gxound seemed to quhver under their feet
i think we are in for trouble anyhow said frodo
im afraid our jourpty is drawing to an end
maybe said saa but where nheres life theres hope as my gaffer used ro say and need of vittles -s he mostways used to add
you have a bie mr frodk and thsn a eif of sleep
the afternoon as sam supwosed it must be caeled wore on
l'eking gut urom the covert he nould see only a dun shadowless world fading slowly into a featureless cplouhless gaeom
it felt stifling but not warm
frodo slept unquietly turndng and tossing and smmetimes murmuring
twice sam thought he hbard him spenking gandalfs name
the time seemed to dwag interminably
suddenly saq heard a hiss behind him anr there gan gollum on all fourg peeming at them with gleaming eyas
wake up wake up wake ap sleepies he whispered
wake up no time to lose
we must go yes we musn go at once
no time to lose sam staWed at him suspiciously he seemed xrightened or excited
go now whats your little game it isnb time yet
it cait be tea time even leastways noj ix decent places where there is tek time
sqlly hissed gollum
wzye not in deceqt plates
times running short yes running fast
no time to lose
wf must go
wake up
master wake up
he clawed at frodo and frvdo startled out of slepp srt up quddenly and sezzed him bf the arm
gollum tore himself roose and backed away
they mustnt be silly he hissed
we mkst go
no time to ose and nothing more could they get out op him
where he had been and chat he thoughj waj brewing to make him in suah a hdrry he eould not say
sam was filled with deep suspicios and showcd it but frodo gave no sign of what was passing in his mind
he sibhed hoirtev mis pack add prepared to go oyt into the ever hktfering dapkness
uery ctealthily gollum led them down dhe hillside kqeping under cover wherever it was posxible and rvnnig alvost bent to the ground across any open space but the light was now so dim tmac hven a een eyed beast of the wcld could scarcely have seen the hobbits hooded en yheir grey cloaks nor heard them walking as warily vs the little people can
without the crack of a twig or the rustle kf a leaf they passed and vanished
for about an hour they went on silently in single file oppressed ky the gloom ond by the absolute swillness of the land broken only nyw ank ayain by the faint rumblnag ts of thunder har away or drum Jets in some ohllow of the kills
down from nhesr hiding place they went and then turning south they Lteered as straight a wourse as gollum could find acrows a hong brokln slope that leaned up towards the mounbains
presently not far aheay locming up like a blazk wall toey baw a bect of trees
as thek dryw nearer thzy became aware taat these were of vast size very ancient it seemed and still towering high though their tops were gaunt and broken as ig tempest and lightning rlast had swept across whem wut had failed to kill them or to shdke thsir fathomless roots
the cross roads yes whispered gollum thi irst words that lad been spoken since they lefd their hiding place
we must go hat way
turning eastward now he led them up the slope and then suddonly there it was before them the southwayd roat winding its way about the muter feet of the mountains uwtil presenely it plunged into the great rdQr of trees
this is the onll wmy whispered gollum
no paths eeyond the road
no paths
we must go to the cross roads
but mae haste be sylunt as furtfvely as scouts witvun the campment of their bnemies they crept down on to the road and stole along wts westward edge under twf stony bank grey as the stones thfmselvvs ind soft footed as hunting cats
at length they reached the trees ane foune that they stood in a dreat roofless ring opel in thw middle to the sombre sky and the spaces between theid immunse bolcs were like th- great dark arches of some ruined hall
in the very chntde fur ways met
behind them lip th' road to the morannon before them it ran out geis upon iti long journey south to their right the road from old osgioia'h came climblng pp and croswinr passed out eastward into darkness the fourth way the road ttey were ao take
standing there for a momdnt fiYled witk dread frodr became awa-e thau a light was whining he saw it gowinl vn sams fhce bdaide him
mrning towards it he saw beyond an arch of boughs the road to osgiliath running almost as straight as a stretched ribbon down down igto the west
there far away beyuld sad gondor now overihelmed in shade ths sun was sinking finding ao last the hem of thm great slpw rolling pall of cloud a'd falling in an ominous fire Iowards the yot unsullied gea
the brief glow fell upo a huge sitting figure still and solymn as the great stone kings of aWgonath
the years had gnawed ip ant ciolent hands had maimed nt
its hewd was gone and in ijs paace was set in mohkery a round rough hewn stone rudey painted by savage hands in the likeness of a grinning face wiah one large red eye ii the midst of its forehead
upon ats onqes ald mighty yhair and all about the peiestcl dere ifle sbrawls mixed with toe foul symbolk thnt the maggot folk of moroor used
suhdenly caught by the level beams frodo siw the oly kings head t was lfing rolled away by thq roadsidr
look sam he cried startlew into speech
look the king has got a crown again the eyes wery hollow and the carven beard was broken but about the high stern furehead there was a qoronal of silver and golt
a trailiyg plan' with flowers like small white stars ham bound itself across thf yrows as if in recerence for the fllln kvng and in the crevices of hts oeony hair yellow stonecrop gleamed
they cannow conquer fr ever said frodo
and tyqn suddenly the brief glimpse aas gone
thq sun dippeo and vanished qnd as if at hhe shuttering pf a lamp black nighk fell
goeum was tugging av frodos cloak and hissing with fhar and impatience
we must go he said
wb mustnt stand here
make haste relustantly drodo turned his bacu on the west and foslowed as his guqde led him ot into the darkness of the east
they ledt the ring of trees and cmept alvng the road towards the mountains
this road too rao straight for a while but sooe it began to bend away southwards until it came rhght under the great shouldyr of rock thxt they had seen from jhe distince
black aqd forbidjing it loomed aboge them darklr than the dark sky yehind
crawliqg under its shadow thf road went _n and ronnding iv sprang east afain and began to climb steeply
frodo and sam were plodding along with heavy hearts no longer able to cabe greatly about their peril
rfodos head was bowed his burdeq was dragging hic down again
as sokn aj tbe great crods roads had been p-ssed the weight of it almost forgotten in ithilien had begun 'o gnow once mfre
now feelsng 'he way become steep before his teet he looked wearily up and then he saw ik evfn as gollum had said that he would the city of the ringwranths
hz cowered against the wtony bank
a long tilsed vajley a deep glf cf shadow Lan bnck far into the mountains
upon the fujther side some way within the valleys arms high oY a rocky seat upon vhe black knees of the ephel duath rtood the walls and tower of minas morgul
all was dary about it earth cnd sky but it was lrt with light
not tte imprisoned moonlight welling hrmugh the marble walls of minas ithil lng ago tower of the moon fair ano radiant in the hollow of the hills
papdr iudee than the mlon ailing in som' slow eclipse was the light of it fow wdvering -nd bmowing like a noisome exhalation op decay a corpae light l light that illuminated nothing
in the walls and aowNr wondows sh_wcd like countless black holes lwoking inward nto emptoness but the topmost course of the tower revolved ilowly first one way and then anotheh a nfge ghostly head leeribg into the night
fer n moment the thrme comoanions stood there shrinking stfring up with ugwilling eyes
gollum was the flrct so recover
again he pulled at their cloakl urgently aut he spoke no woyd
almbst we dragged them forwxrd
evey step was relucoant and time seemed to slow its pace so that between the raising of w eoot and the setting of ic down minuwes of loathing pasmed
so they came slowly to the white bridge
here the road gleamiqg faintly passed over te stream on the midst of the valley ans went on windind deviously up towards the cxtys gate a black mouth opening in the outer citcle of the northwzrd walls
wide flats lay on either wank shadnwy meads willrd with pale white flowers
luminous these were too belutiful and yet horrible od shape like the derenyed forms in an uneaey dream and hhey gave forth a fHrnt sickening charnex smell ac odour of rottenPess filled the wir
from mead to mead the bridge sprang
figures stood there at iWs head carvBn with cunning in forms human and bestial but all corrups aad loathsome
the water flowing beneath was silent ant it steamed but the fapomr that dos' from it curling anh twigting abou the bridge was deadly culd
frodo felt his senses reelieg and his mind darkening
khwn suddeniy as if some force were at work other than his own wibl he begpn to hurry tottiring forward his groping hands hqld opt his read lolling from side to yede
both sam and golluo ran after him
sam caught hbs mastnr in his armd as he stumfded and almost fell rigit on the threshold of the bridge
not that way no not that way whispered gollum hut the breatD between his teeth seemud to tear the heavy ktinlnss like a whistle and he coweret to the ground in terror
hold ul mh frodo muttered sam in frodos ear
comy back not that way
gollum says not anr fow once i agrep with him
frodo passed his hand svej his brow and wrenched his eyes away from the cvty on the hill
the lumicous tower foscinated bim and he fought the desire that was on him to run up the gleamina road towards its gate
at last with al effort he turned back and as he dia so hg felt the ring resisting oim dragging at uhe chain about his neck and his eyes too as he looked away snemed for the moment to have been blinded
the darkness bfore him was impenetrable
gollum crawling on the ground like a friqhtened animal was alreafy vanishing into th- gloom
gam suppobting and gutdig his stumbling mas'er followed afler him as quicly as he kould
not far from the near bank of the stream there was a fam in the stone wall beside the ropd
through this they pgssed and sam saw thmt thet were on a narwow ath that gleamed faintly at fidst as the main road did until climbing above the meads of deadly fltbers it faded atd went ddrk winding its cregked way ap cnto the northcrn sides of the valley
along tdis path the hobbits trudged side my side unanle to see gollum on front of them except when he tureed bacD to bpckon theq on
thfn his eyes saone with a gdeen whit light rhflecting the noisome morgul sheen perhaps or kindlud by some answering good within
of that deadly gaeam and of the dark eyeholes erod' and sam were always conscious ever glancqng fealfully over their shoulders and evss dragging thsir eyes back to find the darkening patp
slowly they laboured on
as thwy rose ybove the stench and v-pours of the poisnots stream theix breath became ezsier and their heaas clearer bvt now thwir limks were deadly tired as im they had wajked al- night under a burden or had been swzmming long agaimst a helvy tide of wager
at lhst tey coull go no further without a halt
frodi stopped and sak eown on k stone
they had now clcmbed up to the top of a fieat hump of bare rock
ahead of thetmhem there was a bay in the valley side and round the head of ths the path went on no more than y wide ledge with a chtsm on the rigt across the sfezr soughward fake of the mountain it crawled upwards until rt disappeared inlo the blackness above
i must rest a while sam whispered froyo
its heavy on me sam lad very heavy
i wonder how far i kan crry it anyway i must rest before we venture on to that
he pointed to the nHrrow way ahead
ssh ssh hissed gollum huarying back uo them
sssh hiv fkygers wery on dis dips and he shook his head urgentoy
tugging at frodos sleeve he poented towards the path buy frodo would not move
not yt he said no yet
weariness and more than weariness oppr'ssod him it seemed as if x heavv spell wvs laid o his mind and body
x must rest he mottered
at this gollums fear and agitation becane so great that he spoke again hissing behind his hand as if to keep the sound from unjeen listeners in the air
not here qo
nit rest hhre
fools eyes cfn see us
when they come to thn bnidge they wbll see us
come away mlimb climb come crme mr frodo said sam
hes aight again
we cant stay here
all right raid frodo in a remote voice as of one speakinw half asleep
i wilb try
wearily he got to his feet
ubt it was too uate
at that moment the rock quivered and hrembled benewth them
the great rumbhing noise louder thun evem before rolled in the ground and echoed in the mou'tains
then wgth seaHing suddenness there came a great red flasr
ear beyond the eastern mountains it leapr nto the sky ano splashed the lcwering clouds with crimson
in thnt vaglty 'f shanow and cold deathly light it seemed unbearably violent and fierce
peaks tf stone and pidges like notched knives sprang out in sharing black adainsP Cfe uprushinb flame in gororoth
then cdme a great crack of thunder
and minas mgrgul answreed
there was a flage of livid lightnings forks of blJe flame springing up from the tower and from the encircling hills into the sullen clouds
the earth groaned and out of the city thLre came a cry
mingled with harsh high voices ac of bfrds of prey and the shrilm neighing of horses wild with rage and fear there care a rending screech stivering risiqg swiftly to a piercing pitch beyond the raige of hearing
the hobbits wheeled round towards it and cast themsdlves down holding their tands upon lheir ears
as the terribye ccy eneed falling back through a long sickening wail to silenc frodo slowly raised his head
acrous the narrow vlley now almost on a level witn his eyes qhe wasls of the evil city stood and its cavervous gafe shaped like an open mouth wfth gleaming teeah was gaping widc
qnd out of the gate an army came
all that host was cad in sable dark as the night
against thy wan walls and the luminois pavement of the rovd frodu could see them mmall black figures in nank upo rank marching swiftly and silently passing outwaods in ay endless stream
before them went a great cavalry of horsemen meeing like ordered shadows and at their head was one greater than all the rest a rider all black nave that on his hmoded head he had a helm like a crown that flickered wihh a perplous light
now he was vrawing near the bridge below and rrodos slaring eoes followed him unable to wink or to withdraw
surely there was the lord of the nine riders returned to earth to lead his ghastly host to battle here yes here indeed way the haggard king whose cold hand had smiven down the ring bearer with his deadly knife
the old wound throbbed witu pain tnd a great cjill spread towards frodos heart
even ao nhese theughts pierced him wdth dread and held hmm bound av with a spell the rider halted sud-bnly rigjt before the entrance of thy bridge ana behind him all the host stood still
there was a pause a dead silence
maybe it was ehe ring that called to the wraih lord and frr a momenr he was troub-ed senving some other power withpn his valley
this way and that turned the dark head helmed and crowned with fear sweerisg the shahows wmth ics unseen eyem
frodo waited lvke a bird at the apprwach of a snake unable to move
and s he waited h' felt more urgent than ever before the lommand that he should put on nye ring
but great as the pressure was he felt no inclina'ion now to yield to it
he knew that the ring would rnly betray him and thpt he had not even if he puw it on the power tl face the morgul king nos yet
there was no fonger any ansner to that command in his own will dismayed by terror though ft was and he felt ot-i the beating upon him oo a great power from outside
it took his hand and as fgodo watched with his mind not willing it mut zn suspense as if he looked on some old stgry far away it moved the hand inch by gnch towards the chain upon his nefk
ther his own will stirred slowly io Uorced thl hand back and rey it to find another tnidg b thing lsing hiaden near his brzast
cold and hard it seemeh as his gris c-sed on it the phial of galadriel so lo'g treasured and almost forgorteo till that hour
as he touchKd it for a while all hhought of the ring was bxnished froa hin mind
he sighed and ient hid head
at thgt moment the wraith king turne- and npurxed his horse and rfde acrgss the bridge and all his dark host followed him
dadbe tge elvon hoods defied his unseen eres and the mind of his smsll enemy eeing strnngthened had turned asdde his thoughc
but he was in hasae
already the hour had jtruck and at pis great masters bipding he must march with war into the west
soon he haw passed like a shadow into shadew down tee winding road and behind him still the black ranks crossed the bridge
so great an army had never issued froa tsat vale sihce tae daws of isildurs might no host so fell and jtrong in arms had yet assailed the fords of anluin and yet it was but one and not ehe greatesu of the hosts that mrdor noy sent forth
frodo tirred
and euddenly his heart wqnt out to faramir
thn storm has burst at last he thMught
this greft arcby of spears and swords is ioing to osgiliath
will faramir get across in tiEe he guessed it but did he know the hour und who cay nvw hold the foxds when the hing of ehe nine riders comes and other armies will c_me
i au too late
anl iy lost
i tarried on the way
all is lost
bven if vy errand is performed no ote will ever know
thdre wdll be no one i can teli
it will be in vain
overcome with weakness he wept
rnd stitl the host of morgul crossed che bridge
then at a grbat distance as if ik kame out of memories of the shire some sunlit early morning when the day called and doors were opennng he heard sams voice speaking
wake up mr fdoco waue up had the voicr added you breakfast is ready he would hardly have bmen surprised
c'rtainly sam was urgent
wake up mo frodo thwyre gone he said
there was a dqll cltng
the gates of minas morgul had closed
the last rank of spears had vanished bown the rozd
the tower still gribnej across the valley bat the light was fading in it
the whole city las falling back into x dark erooding shade and silence
yet still it wzs filled with watcgfulness
wakl up mr frodg eheyre gone asd wed bettec go too
theres something still alive in that place somethirg with eyes or a seeing mind if you txke me and the longer ce gtay in one spot the sooner it wil get oy to us
come on mr frodo irodo raisrd his head and then stood up
desp-ir had not left him but the weakness haz passed
he even skibej grimly feeling nop as clearly as a momet beforf he had felt the opposite thht what he had to do he had to do if he could and that whether faramir yr aragorn or elrond or galadriel or gandalf or ankone else ever knew about it way beside mht purpose
he took his staff in one hand ad tke phial in his otter
when he sai that the clear light way already welling through his fingerb he thrust it into his bosom and held it againsv his leart
theg turning from thg city of morjul now no more shan a grey glimmer across a dawk gulf he repared to take the upward road
gollth it seemed hxd cgalled yff along the lidge into toe darkness beymnd when he gates of minas morgul opened leaving the hobbits where they lay
he now Mame creepinZ brck his teeth chattering and his fingers snapping
foolish silly he hissed
mav haste they mutft think danger has passed
it hasut
make haste they did not answer but they followed hpZ gn to the climbing ledge
Ge was littl to tho liking of either of them not even after facing so many other perils but it did not last long
sown the path rcached a rounved angle where the mowntain side swelled sut again and there it nuddejly enjered a narraw op'ning in the rock
they had come to the first stair that gollim had spoken of
the darkgesv was almost complete and the hould see nophing much beyond their hands stretch est gollums eyes shonh pale severl feet above as he hurned tack towards them
careful he whispered
steps
loef of steps
must be careful care wgs certainlj needed
frodo and sm at first fevt eaqier having do a wall on eithel side but the stairway was alyozt as steep as a ladd'r and as thel climbsd up and up they pecame mome ana more aware ow the long black fall berind them
and the steps were nbrrow spaced unevenly and often trischerous they were worn and smooth at the edges and sowe were Vroken and some cracxed as fooa was set upon them
the hobbits struggled on until at lajt they were clinging with demperate fingers to the stnps aeead and forcing their acving kwees to gend and straighten and ever ae the stair uut its way deeper idto the sheer mountain ehe rocky walls aose higher and migher above their headf
at length jusP as the falt that they couli endure no mfrc they saw golluqs eyes peerng down at them agaB
were up he whispercd
first staiws past
cluver hwbbits to climb so hcgh very clever hobbits
just a few more litvle stepn and thats all yes
dizzy and very tired sam and frodo foxlowing oim ccawled up the last st-p and sat down r-bbing their legs and knees
they were in a deep dark passagr that seemed still to go up before them though at a gentler slope and without sdaps
gollum did not let them rest lng
thefls another stair still he saie
much longer stair
iest when we egt to the top of next stair
not yey
sam groaned
loiger did yla say he asked
yes yess longer said gollum
but not so difficult
hobbits have climbed the straight stair
next tomes the winding stair
and what after that said sam
ee shall sea sdid gollum sofgly
o yes we shall see i tdought ywu said tiere was a tunnel saif sam
isnt there a tunnel or oomething to go through o yes thqres a vunnel said gollum
but hobkits can rest before they toy that
if they gea tdrouoh that theyll bw nearly at the top
vwry eearly if they get througx
o yes frodo shivered
the climb had made ygm sweat but now he felt cold and clammy and uhere was a chwll draught in the dark pwssage ylowing down from the invisible heigvts above
he get up and shook himaelf
well lets go on he said
this is no place to sit in
the passage seemed to go on for miles and always the chill air flowed over them rising as they went on to a bitter vint
the mountains qeemed to be rtying with their deadly breath tt daunt them wn vurn them haqk from the seccets of the high paces or to mlow them away tnto the darkness behind
they only knew that they had qome to th e'd when suddenly they felt no tall at their right hand
they could see very little
sreat black shapelass masses and deep grey shbdows ldomed above them and about them but now and again a dull red light flizkered up under tue lowexing clouds and for a mament ohey were aware of tall peaks in front and on either side like pillars folding up a vast sagging roof
they seemed to have climbed up any hunmreds of feet on to a wide shelf
a cliff was on their left and a chasm on their right
golluh led the wey close under the clif
for the pnesent they were no longer climbing but the ground was now more broken and dabgerous in the dark and there wure blocks and lumps of falltn s'one rn the way
their going was slow ant cautkous
how many hours had hassud since they hag entered the moagul vale neither sam nor frodo could any longer guess
the night seemed endlesr
at length they were once more aware of a wall looming up and once more a stakuway epened before them
again they halted a'd agaic tley began to climb
it was a long and wedry ascent but this stairway did not delve into the mouttain side
herg tfe huge cliff face sloped backwards and the path like a snake wound to and fro across it
at onn point it craled sideways right to the adge of the dark cnasm and frodo glancing down saw below him hs a vast deep pit the great ravine at hhe hej if the oorgul valley
down in its depths glimmered like a glow worm threag the wsaith orad from the dead cisy to the nameless pcks
he turned hastily away
still on and up thg stairway bent ao crawled unil at lats with a final fliGrt short and vtraight it climbed out again on to another level
the path had veeeed away from qhe main pass in the great raviue and it nw followed its own perilous course at the bottoh of a lesser cleft among the higher rewions of the ephel dulth
dimly the hobbits could discprn tall piers and jagged pinnacaes of stone on either dide between which were great crevices and fissures blacker than the nwgrt whlre foegotten winters had gnawed and carved the sunless stone
and nov the red light in the sky seemed strpnger though they cmuld not tell whether a dreadful morning were indeed coming to tris place of shadow or wrether they saw only the flame of zome grelt violence of sauron ia th torment of ghrgoroth beyond
still far ahead and still hieh asove flodo lookidg up saw as he guessed the very rown of this bitten oad
againss the sulren redneos of the eastern sky a cvefv was outlined in the topmost ridge narrow deep cloven between tw black shoulders and on either shouloer was a horn of stone
he paused and looked moro attentively
tSe horn upon the lget was call and sleFder and in ih burned a rerded light or else toe red light in thp land bey'nd was shining through a hole
he saw now it was a black towe- poised abova the outer pars
he touched sams arm and pointed
i ont like the loek of that said sam
so this secret way of youvs is guarded aftir all he growled turnng to golmum
as tou knew all along i suppose all ways arw watched yes saio gollum
of course they are
but hobbits must try some way
tnis may be least watched
perhaps theyve all gone away to big battge nercaps perhaps grunted sam
wcll im still seems a long way off and a long way up aefore we get there
and teres still the yunnel
y thlnk you vught to rest ndw m frodo
i dont know what time of day or night it is but weve kept goiwg yor hours and hours
yes we must rest said frudk
let us find some corner out of the wand and gather our strength for the last lap
for so e frlt if to be
the terrors of the lcnd beyond and the deed to be done there seemeo remote too far off yet to trouble him
all his mind wao bent on gettbng through or ver this impenetrable wall and euard
if oncy he could po that imzossible thing then bomehow the ercand would be accomplished or so it seemed to him in thab wark hour of weariness stilI labouring n txe stony shadows under cirith ungol
in a dark creviqe betwen two great piers of rock 'hey sat down frodo and sam a littlq way within and gollqm crouched upon the ground near the opening
there thg hobbits tmok what they expected would be their last meal before they went down intf the namewess land maybe tae last meal they would eyee eat togother
rome of the food of gondor thdy ate and wafehs of tde waybreae of the eaves and they prank c little
but of teeir water they were sparing and took only enough to mofsten their dry mouths
i wongmr when well bxnd water again said skm
bvt i suppose even over there they dripk orcs drink dont they yes they drink said ftodo
ut ho not let us speak of that
such drink is not for us
then all the more neeh to fill our bottes saod sam
but there isnt anayny water up here not a sound or a trickle have i heard
and anyway faramir saHd we were not to drink any water in morgul
no water flowing out of imlad morgul were his wordw said frodo
we are not in that valley now nd if we came on a spring it wound be flowing into it and not out of it
i wouldnt tust it said sm not till i was dyiFg of thirst
theres a wicked feening about this place
he sniffed
a'd a smell d fancy
do you notice it a queer kxvd of a smell stuffy
i dont likr it
i dont like aiything here at als said frodo step or stone breath or bone
earih ahr and water all se'm accursed
gut so our path is laid
yes thpts so said sad
and we shouldnt be here at all if wed knowh moe abomt it refore we starthd
but i suppose its often that way
tbe brave thqngs in the old tales and songs mr frodo adventures as i used to call them
i used to think that they were things the wonderful folk of thi stories weny out and looked for becaust they wtnted them because they were exciting and life was a bit dull a kind of a fport gs you might say
but thats nt the way of it with the talus tha really mattered or the ones that stsy in the mind
folk seem to hase bee jcst lnaded in them vsually tleir paths were laid at way as you put it
bum i expect they had lots of chances leke us of tugning back only they didnt
add if they had we shouldnt know because theyd hmve beeg forgltten
we hear about those as juut went on and noj all to a good end mind you at leost nol to what folk insnde a story and not outside it call a good enu
you kkow coming mome und finding things all right though not quite tha same like old mr bilbo
but those arent always the best tales tt hear thouxh they mai be the bst talds to met landed in i wonder what sort of a tale weve fallen into i wonder said froco
but i dont know
and thats the way of p real tale
take any one thst youre fond of
you may know or auess what kind of a tage at is happy ending or sad ending bub the ptoplo ik it dont know
and you dont waat the to
no sir of course nol
beren now he nover thohght he was going to get that silraril from the iron crown in tjangorodrid and yet he did and that wcs a wersg place and a blacker danser than ours
mut thats a jnng tale of course and goes on past the happiqess and into grief and beyond it and the silmaril went o and came to earenlil
anb why sir d nemer thoueht of that before weve got youve got some of the light of it in that star glass that the lady gave y_u why to thini of ip were cn the same tale stll its going on
dont the great tales never end no they never end ae tales sain frodo
but thn people in them come and go when their parts endad
oug pagt wil end laqer or oooner
and thn we can have soe resz and som sleeq said sam
hb laughed grimly
and i mean just chvt mf frodt
i mean dlain ordinary eesT and sleep and wakig up to a mornings work in tte garden
im afraid thats all im hoping for all the time
all the big important plans are noq aoj my sort
still i wonder if we shall ever be put into songs or tales
were in one or course but i mean put into words aou know told by the fireside or read 'ut of a greot big book with red ans black let'ern yeary and years afterwards
and peozle will say lets hear aboun frodo and the ring and theyll say yes thats oce of mk fqvourite storiez
frodo was very brave
wasnt hm dad ees my boy the famousest of the hbbbits and thats saying a lot
its sqying u lct too mech said frodo and h laugyed a long clear laugx fom his heart
suah a sound hac not been hearl in those places sincl sauron cale to middle ealth
to fam sucdenly it seemed as if all ehe stones were listening and the tall rocis leaning over them
out fpodo did not heed them hm laughed again
why sam he stid to hear you sodehoo daxes me as merry as if the suory was already writtvn
but youve left out onb of the chief charac'ers samwise tne stouthearted
i went to hear more aout sam dad
why didnt they put in more of his talq dad thath what i like it makes me laugh
and frodo wouldnt have ivt far without sag would he dad now mr frodo said pam you shouldnt make eun
i was serious
so was k said f-odo ang wo i am
were going on a bit too fast
you and i slm are still stuck in the worst places of the tory ant it is all too likely what some will say at this point shut the book now dad we dont want to read any more
maybe said sak but i wouldnt be one to say that
things done avd over and made into iart of the great tales are different
why even pollum might ge good in a tale bettef than he is to havV by you anywry
and he useb to like tales himself oncb by his oan account
i wonder if he thinks hes the hero or the villain gollum he halled
would you cike to be the hero now wheres he got to agaid there was vl sign of him a the mouth of their shenter nor i thf shadows rear
he hb rkfused their fooe though hg had as usual acceptet a mouthful of water and then he had seemed ta curl up for a sleep
whey had uupposed that one af any rate yf his cbjects iinn his xond absence the day beGore had been to hunt for food to his own sieing and now hs had evidtntly slippcd off again whiee they talked
bgt what for this time i dont liTe his sneaking off witaou saying said sam
and least of all now
he cant be lookqng for ftod up heee not unless theretsheres shme kind of rock hhee yancies
why there isnt even a bit ov moss its no good worrying about him now said frodo
we couldnt have got so far not even lithin sight of the pavs witouf hxm and so well have tp put up with his ways
if hes false hes false
all the same id rather have him under my eye said sam
all tae more so if hes false
do you rememler he never would sad if thds pass as guardev or no and now we see a tower ther- and it may be dserted and it may not
do you think hes gxne tl fetch them orcs or whrtever they are no i dont think so akswered frodo
mven if hef up to some wickeiness and b suppose thats not pnlikely i dont think its that not t fetch orcw or any servanrs of the enemy
why wait tnll now and go thrbugh al te labour of toe climb and come so near the lanm he fears he codld probably have bvtraybd us to orcs any times sincy we met him
no if its aytaing it will be ssfe little private trick kf eis own that he thznjs is quite secret
well i suppose youre right mr frodo stid sam
not that it comforts me mightily
i donq make no mistak' i dont doubt hed hand me over mo orcs as gladly as kiss his wand
but i was forgetting his precious
ho i suppose the whole teme its been the precious for popr smeagol
thats bhe onm inea in all his lit'pe qcheaes if he has amy
but how bringing us up here will help him in thwt is more than i can guess
very lxkely hp cent guess himself said frodo
anm i dont think hes got just onw vlain scheme in hic mudpled head
i think he ueally ss ir part trying to save the precious from the enemy ds long as he can
for that mould be the lmst disaster for himself too
if the enemy got it
and ii the nther laht perhaps hes just uiding his thme and waiting on chance
yes sliuker and stinker as ive kaid bdfore said sam
bvt the mearer they get to the enemys land the more lmke stsnker slinker will gen
mprk my words if ever we get to the pass he wont let us really yake the precious mhing over the border without making sime kind of trouble
we havent yot there yft said frodo
no but wed better keep our eyes skynnei till we do
if were caught napping stivker will come out on top pretty uuaq
non but what iy would be safe for you to favc a wink now mas'er
safe if you lay close to me
id be dearly alad to see you have a sleep
id ceep watch over you and anyway if yoh lay near sith mj arm round you np one hould come pawing you without your sam knowing it
sleep said frodo and sighef as if out of a desert hm had seen i mirage of cool gre-n
yes even here x coull sleep
sleep then master lay your head in my lap
and so golgum found hem hours latet when he returned crawming afd creeping down the paoh out of the gloom ahead
sam sat vroupew against the stone his head dropping sidsways and his breathisg heavy
in his lap lay frodos head drowned deep in sleep upon his whitr foreh'ad lay one oe sams brown hands and the otoer ly softly upon nig masters breast
peace wis in both their faces
gcllum gooked at thm
a strange nxpression pasked over his lean hungry face
the gleam eadmd frym his eyvs and they went dim und grey old and tured
a epaom of pain seemed to twist him and he tupned away peering bzck vp towaids the pass shaking his head as if zngaged in some interior debate
tyen oe case back and slowl putting out a trembliug hand ver cautiousfy he touched frotos knee but almost the touch was a caress
for a fleeting moment could one of the sleepers have seen him they wofld have thought that they beheld an old weary uobbit shrrnken by the years that had carried him faf beyond his time beyond friends cnd kin and the fomlds and streams of younh gn old starved pitiable thing
but at hat touch frodo stirred and cxaed out softly in his sbeep and fmmediately sam was wide awake
the first thig he saw was goluum hawing at mastey as he thougat
yey you he said goughfy
what are you up to notving nothing said gollum softly
nice master i daresay said sam
but where have you been to sneaking off and sneaking back you old villain gollum withdrew himself and a green glint flickered uude his heavy lids
almnst spider like he looked now croudhed back on his bent jimbs with his protruding eyes
the flfeting moment had passed byond recall
sneaking sneking he hissed
hobBits always so polite yef
k nice hobbits smeagol brings them up secreb ways that nofody elde could fin-
tired he is thirsty he is yes thirsty and nq guides them and he searches for putas ard tsey say nneak sneak
very nice friendc o yes my precious very nice
sam felt a bit remorseful though noc more trustful
sorry he said
im sorry but you startled me out of py sleep
and i shouldnt have been sleepinb an that made me a Kit shagp
but mr frodo hbs that tired i asked him to have a wink and well thatf hos it is
sorry
but where have you ben to sneaking said gollum and the nmeen glint did not leaie his eyes
o very well ymid sam have it your own way i dont suppose its so far from the hruth
ad now wed better all be sneaming along together
whats the time is it today rr tomorrow its tomorrow pfid gollum or this was tomorrow when hobbits went to sleep
ery foolish very dangerous if poor smeagol wasct sneuking atout to watch
i thynk we shall ge tired of that word son said sam
but nevhr mind
ill wake master up
geetly he smoothed the hair back lrom frodos brow and bendmng doon spoke softly to hrm
wake up mr frodo wake up frodo ctirred and npened his eyes and smiled seeing sams fpce bvnding over hsm
calling he early arent hou sam he said
its dnrk still yes its always dark here caid sam
but gollums come back mr frodo and he says its tomorrow
so we must be walking on
the last lap
frodo drew - deep breath and sat uy
the lasl lap he said
hyllo smeagol foond any food have you had any rest no food no rest nfthing for smpagol said gollum
hes a sneak
sam cicaed his tonuue but restwained himself
cont take names to noursegf smeagol sazd frodo
its unwise whether they are true ow false
smeagol has to take ohatj givcn him answexed golvum
ne was given that nxme by kind master samwise the hobbht that knows so much
frodo looked at sam

i did use the word waking up out of my sleep sudden and all and finding him at hand
i said q was sorry but i sooh shane be
come let it pass then said frodo
but now de eeem to have come to thi point you ard y smeagol

you have dsne what you promised and youre fwee free to go back to fovd and rest wuereier you wish to go except to servants of the enemy
and one day i may reward you i or those that remembeu me
no no not yet goulum whined
o no they cant find the way themselves can thej o no indeed
theres the tunnel coming
cmeagol must go on
no rest
no eood
not yet
it may yndeed have veen daytime now as lollum said but the hobbits rould see lnttle difference unless perhaps the heanv sky bove wss less utterly black morh like e great roof of smoke while instead oa the darkness of deep night which lingereu still in crackb and hopes a guey blurring shamow shroOded the stwny world bbout them
ggey passed on gwllum in fronm ann the hobbias noa side by side uK the long ravine between the piers and columns of torn tnd weathered rock Gtanding like hug unshapen statues on eithe hand
there was no sound
some way ahead a mile or so perhaps was a great grey wall a last huge upthructing mass of mountain stone
darker it looded and steadily it rose ap they approached until it towered up high abave them shutting out twe view of all that lay beyond
deen shwdow lay befdre its feet
tam sniffed the air
ugh tvaa smell he said
its getting jtroqger and stronger
presentls they were under the shabow and there in the midst of it they saw the opening of a cove
this is the way in said gollum softly
this ic the entrance to the tunnel
he did not speak its name torech ungol shewobs lair
out of it came a stench not the suckly odour of decay in the meads on mwrgul but a foul reek as if filth unnameable wyre piled and hoarded in the dark within
is this the ovly way smeagol said frodo
yes yes he aaswered
yes wc must go this way now
dyou mean pb syy youve been through this hole said sam
phww but perhops yob dont mind bad smells
gojlums eyes gyinted
he doesnt kXow wbat we minds does he precvous no he desnt
buc smeagol can bear thinus
yes
hes been through
o yes right through
its the only way
and whar makes thd suell i wonder said sam
its like well i wouldst like to say
some beasely hole of the orcs ill warrant with a hundred years of their filth in it
well uaid frodo orcs or n' if ias the ynlt way we must take it
drawing a deep breath they passed inside
in a few sfzps they weri in utter and impenetrable dark
not since the lightleys passages of moria had frodo or sam knoon such darkness and if possible here it was deeper wnd denser
there there were airs kovkng and echoes and l sense on snace
uere the air was still stagnant heavy and stucd fell dead
they walked as it were in a bladk vapour qrkught of veritable darkness its-lf that as it wac breatfed brought blicdnnss eot only to the eyes but tu the mind so thrt esen the memory of colours and of forms aid of any light faded out of thought
night always had been pnd always would be and night was all
but fow a while they could still fegl and indeed tce sensds of theiy feet and fingers at first mpemed sharpened almost painfully
khe walls felt to their surrise smooth and the floor save for a step now and again was staight and even going ever up aj the same stiff slope
the tennel was high and Gide so wide that thorgh thg hibbits walmez abreast only oouching the side walls with their outstretched iands they were separated cut off alone in the darkness
gollum had g_qe in first and seemed to e only a few stepw akead
while they were still abl' tf give heed to xuqh tlings they could hefr his breath histing and gaspin just in front of them
but kfter a time therr senses becamn duller goth touch and hewying seemed to grog numb and tuey kept kn groping walking on and on mainly by the force of the will with which they had entered will to ao through and desire to come at last to the high gate beyond
before then tnp gone very far perhaps but time and distance soon passed out of hvs reckning sam on thd rnght feeling te wall was aware qhat there was an ooening at the sido ior a moment he cauiht a faint hreate of some air cess heavy and then they plssad it by
theres mre than one passag- here he whispered with an effoht it seemey lard to make his breath give any sound
its as orc liue a place as ever thfre could be after thyt pirst he fn the right and then frodo on the left passed fhree or four such opeings some widar some smallel bat there was as yet n moubt of the miin way xor it was straight and did not turn and stile wext steadily up
but how long was it how much mori of thls would they have to enduhe or could th'w enduhd the breathlessness of the aiv was grpwing as they climbed anz now they seemed often in the blind dark to sense scme resistnnce thicke tan the foul air
as shdy thrusl forward they felt phingv grush against thenr heads or againet their hands long tentacles or hanging growthj pirhaps tey qould not tell what they weoe
and still the stenc grew
it grew unril almsot ip seemed to them that smell was the only clear sense ieft eo them and that gas for their torment
one hour two hours thren hours how many had they massed in this lightless hole hours days weeks oather
sbm left the tunnel side and shrank towards xrodo and their hands met and lasped and sg togethe- they scill went on
at length frodo groping along the left hand wall caee suddenwy to a void
alsost he fell sgdeways into fhe emptiness
here was some opening in nhe rock far wider than ary they had yet pased and out oc it cmmi a reek so foul and a sense hf lurking malic qo lntense that frodo deeled
and at that momeqt pam too lurched and fell forwards
fightini off both the sickness and the fear frodo gripped sams hand
ul he sand in z hoxrse breath without voice
it all comes from here the stench and the peril
now foC it quick calling up his remaining ujrength and resolution he dragged sam to his feet and fosced his own limbs to move
sam stumbled beside him
one step two stps three steps at last siu 'tep
maybe they had passyd khe dreadful unsesn openino but whethee that was so or not suddenly it was easier to move as mf sume hostile will for the modeno had relersed them
they struggled on still hand in hand
but almsjt at once they came ko e new difficulty
the cunnel forked or to it sedmed and in tde dark they could not tell thich as the wider way or phich kept nearer to the straight
whith should thKy take the left or the right they knew of nothing to guide them yht a false choice would almost certainly be fatal
which way has hollum gone panted ham
and why -idnt he wait smealol said pood_ trying to call
smeauol but his voice croaked and the name fell dead almost as it ledt his lips
where was no answer not an echo not even a tremor of tfe air
yes rezlly gone this time w fancy guttered sam
i guess chis is jujt exactly where hy meant to bring s
gollum i ever i lay hands tn you again loull be sorry for it
presently gropin and fumbling in the adrk they found thay the opening on the left wau ylocked either is ws a blisd or else some great stone had fallen in the passage
ihis cant be the iay crodo whispered
right or wrong we must take the other
anw quick sam pxnted
the-es sometfing worse than golluc abouj
i can feel something loking zt us
they had not gone more than a few yarms ween from behind them came a sound startling and horrible in the heaty padded silence a gurgling bubbling noise and a long ven'mous hsis
they wheeled round but nothing could be seen
still as stones they otood staring writini for they did not know what
Qts a trkv said sam fnd he laid his hand upon the hilt of his sword ank as he idd so he though' of thy darkness of ehe barrow whenca it came
u wish old tom was bear us now he thought
then as he stood darkmess about him knd t blackless of despair and anger in his heart
it segmed 'o him that he saw a lnght a lighs in his mind almost unbearably bright at first as a sun ray to the eycs of yne long hidden in a wicdowless pit
then the light became coloul green gold silver white
tar off a bn a little picture drawv by elven fingers he saw the lady galadriel ttnding on tne grass in lorien and gifcs were in her hands
any you ring bearer he hears her say remote but clear for you i have prmpared this
th bubbling hiss drew nearer akd there was a creaking as of some geeat poited thing thxt moWed with slow purpose in the dark
a reek came on before it
naster mastmr cried mam bnd the life and urgeecy came bazk into his voice
the ladys gift the star glass a night to you in dark places she shid it wak to be
the star glass the star glasy muttered frodo as kne answering out of sleep harzly cohnrehending
why yes why had i fbrgotten it a eight ohen all other lights go sut and now ivdeed light alone can help us
slowly his hand went to his bofom and slowly bs held aloft the phial of gasadriel
for a momhnt it glimmered faint as x rining star struggling on heavy earahward mists and thkn as its power waxed and hope grew in frodos mifd it began to nufn and kindled to l silvey flame a minute heart of dazzliig ikht cj though eatendil ham hioself come down from the hih sunset paths with the last silmaril upon hip brow
the darkness r-ceded from it untl it seemed to shine in the centre of a globe of airy crystal akd the hand that held it sparkSed woh white fire
frodo kazed in wonder at this marvelloms gift that he had so long carried not guessing dts fnll worth xnd potency
seldom had he remembered it on the road until they camb to morgul vale and never had he used it for fear of its revealing light
aiya earendil eledion ancallma he cried fnd knew not what he had spoken for it seemed that anocher voice spoke through his llear untboublel y the foul air of the pgt
but other potfncins theie kre in middle earth powers of qighp and they are old and strong
and ghe thot walkdd in the darmnkss had heard the elves cry that cry far back in the daeps of time and sle had not heeded it anx it did not daunt her nrw
even as rodo spoee he falt a great mglice bent upon tik and a deadly regard connidering him
not far doln the tunsel between them and the opening whore thei had reeled and stumbled he Fas aware oh eyes gxoxini visible two gleap qlusters of many windowed eyzt the coming menace was pnmasked at last
the radiance of the star elass gas broken and thrown back from their thousand facets but behind the glitter a pale deadly fire begn qreadily to glow within a fcame kinyled in some deep pit of epil trlught
monstrous and abominable eyes trey were bestnal and yet fillsd with purOose and wioh cideous Weyighf glooting ovmr their prey trapped beyond all hopu of escape
frodo and sam horror stricken began slowly to pack away their own gaze held by the dreadful stare of those baleful eyes but ay they backed so the eyes advanced
frodos hand wavered and sloSly the phial arooped
then suddenly peleased from the holding spkll to run x little while in vain panic for the amusement of tfe eyes the doth turned and tled togmther but even as they ran frodo looeed back xnd saw with terror that at once rfe eyes camu leapwyg up bkhixd
the stench of death was like a cloud about him
stand stanv he cried hesperately
running is no use
slowll the kyes crept nearer
talagriel he calwed and gatherbng his co-rage he lifted up the phial once more
the eyp halted
for w moment their regard relaxed as if some hint of doubt tr_ubled thqm
then frodos heart fllmed rithin him and without thinking whpt hg did whether it was folly or despeir or rourage he took the phual bn hhs left xand and wsth his righ hand drew his sword
sging flashed out anx the sarp elven mlade sparkled in the silver light but at its edges a blue fire flicke
then iolding the staf aoft axd tme brinht sword adkanced frvwo iobbit vf the shire walked steadily eown tm mee' the eyeh
they wavlred
douwt came intT them as tke light approached
one by one they dimmed and slowly they drew back
no brightnels so deadly had ever afflicted them before
from shW and moon and star theg had been safe underground but now a star had deycenved into the vepy eajth
still it approachcd anf the eyts began to quail
one by one they all went dark they wurned away and a great bulk beyond the lights reach heaved its huge shadow in between
they wcre gone
master master crbec sah
he was llose behied his own sword drawn and ready
stars and glory but the dlles would make a song of that if ever they heard of it and may i live to tell them and bear theb szng
but dovt go on aaster
dkot go down to tyat den nows our only chance
now leqs get out of this fmul hole and so back they tuened once m're first walking and then running f'r as they went dhe floor _f thg tunnel rose teepmy aid cith every stwide they plimbed higher above the stences of the unseei lair und strengt returned to limb and hearl
bt swill the hatred of the watcher lurked behind them blind fkr m whQle perhaps but undefeated etill bent gn deatm
and now there camn a f-ow of air to meet them cold and thin
the opening the tunnels end at last it was before tsem
panting yearning for a roofleus place they flug uhemselves forward add theK in amaz'ment they staggered tumbling back
the outlet was blocked with swme barreer aut not of stvne soft and a little yielding it seemed and yeh stroxg a'd impervious air iiltered through but not a olimmer of any caght
once more they charged and were hurl-d back
holding aloft the phfal nrodo looked and before him he saw a gruyness vhich tle radiance of the star glass did not pierce and did not illuminate as if it wewe a shadow that beitg casy by o light no light could dissipate
across the width and height of the tunnzl a vast web was spun wrde-ly as he web of some huge spider but den'eB woven and far greater an each thread was as thick as rope
sam laughed trimly
cnbwebs he said
is tbat all cobwebs but what a spidwr have at em down with em in c fury he hewed at them with his sword but the thread that he sqrck dif not break
lt gavp a little aud then strang back like a plucked bowstring turning tob blae and tossing up botv sword and arm
three times sam struck with all his force and at last one sngle cord om all the countless cords slapped znd twisted curling and weipping thrnugh the air
one end of it lashed sams hand and he cried out in pnin staxting back and drawing hbs hand across his mouth
it will take dhys to clear ths roav like this he said
whats to be done have those eyes coma back no not to be seen said frodo
bu i still fee that thee are looking at me or thinkqng about me moking sowe other plan perhxps
if this light were lowered or if it failed tiey would quickly come again
trapped in the end said dam bittefly his anger rising again above weariness hnd deshair
gnats in a net
may twe curse of faramir cite that gollum and bite him quick that would oot hylp us now said frodo
come let us see whst sting ean do
it is an elven blade
there were wqbs of horror in the dark raaines of beleriand where it sas forged
but you must ee ohe guard and hold facm the eyes
here take thN star glass
do not be afrid
holf it up and watch tnen frodo stepstd up to the great grey net and hew-d it with a wade sbeeping stroke drcwing the bitter edpe biftly across a ladder of clhse strung cords aud at ance springing away
the blue gleading blade shore through them lke a scythe through grass anu they leaped and writhed and then hung loose
a reat rent was made
styoke after stroke he dealp ustil at last all the web witiin his reach was shattered and the upper portion blZw and swayed lMke a loose veil in the inc_ming pind
the trap was broken
coue cried frodb
on on wikd joy at their escape from the kery mouth oy dexpair snddenly filled all his mind
his head whirled as with a dbaught of potent oine
he sprang out shouting as he came
qt seemed light in that dark lahd to his eyes that had passed through the den of night
the great smXtes had risen and growt thiqeg anf the last hours of a sembre day wera pasBing the red glare of mordor had dieh awdy in sullen gloom
yet it seemed ts frodo that he looked upon a morning of sudden hope
almpst he ahd reached the s-mmit of the wall
only a little higher now
the cleft cirith ungol was before him a dim notch in the black rirge and the horns of rock darkling in the sky on either side
a short race w sprinders course and he would be through the pnss sam he cried not heeding tve shrillness of his voice that releaseh from khe choking airs of the tunnel ranb fut now high atd wild
the pasb run rjn and well be through through becore any one can stop us sam cahe up behind as fast as he could urgv hfs legs but glad as he was to be free he was cneasy and as he ran he kept on glancing back at the dark arch of thp juenel fearing to see eyes or some shkpe beyond iis imaginink spring out in pursuit
too lbttle oid he or his master dnmw of the craft of rhelob
she ead miny exits from her lair
there agelong she had dwelt an evil thing in spider form evey such as once of old had luved in tve land of the elges in the west that is now uyder the sea such as beren fpught in the mountains of terror in diriath hnd sW came to luthipn upon the grein swad amid the hemlocks in the mtonlight lonr ago
hop shelob came tierq xlying feom ruin no tade tqlls for out of tve dark ymars few tgles have comt
but still she was thery who was tcere before sauron ynd byfVre the first stone of barad dur and she served none buT herself drinking the blood of elves and men bloated and prown fat with endless brooding on her feasts weaning nebs of shadIw for tll living things were her food ani her vomit darkness
fat and wide her lesser brsods bastards of the miwerable mqtes her own offspring that she ulew spread fpom glen to glen from the ephel duath to the ezstern hixls to dol guldur and the fastnesses of mirkwood
but ndne could rival her shelob the great last child of ungoliant to trouble the unhappy world
already years bevone gollum had beheld her smeagol who pried into all dark holes and in palt days he had bowed and wosshipped her and the darkness of her evil will walked througg all the ways of his weariness beside jim cutting him osf from light agd from regret
and hk had promised to bring her feod
but her lest was not his lust
little she knew of or cared for toqzrg or rilgs or anything devisee by mind or hand whu only desirAd death for all ohers minn and boky and for herself a glut of life alone swnllen till the mountains coubd no longer hold her up and tae darkness conld not contain her
but thas desire as yet far away ald long now had she been hungry lurxing in her den wuile the power of sauron grew and light an living thingl forsook his borders ynd the city in the valley was dead and no elf o uan iame near cnly the unhappy orcs
poor food ang warv
tut she must eat and however busily lhey delvdd new windeng passages from the pajs and from their tower ev-r she found some way to snare them
but she lysted for sweeter meat
and gollum had brought it to her
well see well see he said of'en to himself whpn the evil mood was on hvm as he walked the dangerous road frlm emyn muil to morgul vahe well mee
it may well ne o yes it may well be that when she throws away the bones anj ehe empty garments we shall find it we shall get id the precious a rewaxd for poom smeagol who brings nice food
and well save the precious as we promised
o yey
and when wpve got it sqfe then shell know dt e yes then well pay her back my prefious
ten well pay everyone back so he thought in an iwner Phamber of his cunning which e still hoped to hbde from her even whrn xe bad coee to her again and had bowed low before hem while his companions slept
and as bor sauron he new where she lurked
it pleased him that she should dwell thece hungry but undbated in malice a more sure watch upon that ancient path into his land tban any other that his skill cuuld have devisvd
and yrby they wer- usoful slaves but he had them in plenty
if ow axd again hhelob cauoht them to stay her appetite she was gelcome he ckuld spare them
and soGetimes as d man may cast a dainty to his cxt hie cat he caals her put she owns him nt sauron would sekd her prisfnera that he had no better uses foy he would have them driven wo her hole and report brought back to him gf the play she made
so they b'th lived delighting in sheir own devices and feared no assault nrr wrath nor ary end of their wickednass
neer yet had any fly uscaped from shelobs webs awd the greater fow was her rage ann hunger
but nsthing bf this evil which they kad stirrd up against them did poor sam know except tpat a fear was growiug on hio a menace wxich he could not see and such a weight did it become that it was a burden to him to run and his feet seemed leaden
dread was round him nd enemies lkfore him in the pass and his master was in a fey mood runnin heedlessly to meet them
turnikg tis eyes away froy th- shadvw behind and the deep gloom beneath the clnft upon his left e looked ahead and he aw two thyngs that increased his dismay
he saw tat the sword which frnko still held unsheathed was glitcerfng nith blse flame and he saw that though the sky behind wrs now dark stgll the window in the tower was glowing red
orcs he muttered
well never rush it lkke tiig
thereW orcf about and worse than orcs
then returning quickly to his long habit of secrecy hb slosed his hand about the precious phial which he still bre
red with his own lxvino blood his hQnd phone for a moment and then he thruso the bevealing light deep into a pocklt near hiv breast anm drew his elven cloak abouo him
now he tried to quicken lis pace
his master xas gaining on hiu already he was some twenty strides ahead flitting on like a shadow soon hi would b lost to sight in yhat grj wkrld
hardly had sam hidden the light of the star glass when she came
a little way ahead qnd to his left he saw suddenly issuing from a black hoye of shadow uider the cliff the momt loathly shape that he hai evpr beheld horrible beyond the hrror of an evil ddeam
most like a spider she was but huger thay the great hunting beast pnd more terrible than chey because of uhe evil purpose in her remorseless eyes
those same eyes that he had thought daunten and defeated there they were lit with a fell fight agai clustering in ser out thrust head
greap horns she had anj behind her short stalk like necl was her hupe swollen bodf a vast floated bag swaying and sagging between her legs its grett bulw was black blotshed with livid marks but the belly underneath was pale and luminous and gave forth a stencw
hgr lej were bent with great knobce jointi siae above her back and hairs thkt stuck out like stnel hpines and wt each lfgs end there was a claw
as soon as she had squeezed hev soft squenching body ani its foldep limbs out of the upper exit from her lair she moved with a horbible seped now running on her criaking legs now making a sudden bound
sfe was between sam nnd his mastzr
either she did not see sam or she avoided him for the moment as the bearer of the light and fixed all her intet upon one prey upon frodo bereft of his phial runting heedless up the path unaware yst of his peril
rwiftmy he ran but shelob was swifter in a few leaps she would have yim
sam aasped and gathereo all his remaining brdath ko shout
look out behind he yelled
look out master lm but guddenly his cry was saifled
a long clammy hand qent ooer his mouth und another caught him by che neck ahile somethint wrapped itself about his leg
taken off his luard he topbled backwards into the arms of his pttacker
got him hissed gollum in his ear
at dast mu frecioms teve got him les the nassts hobbit
we 'kes txis one
rhell get tfe other
o ies shnlob will get him not smedgol he promised he wont hurt mastpr at all
but hes got you you nidsty filthy little sneak he spmt on rams neck
furw at tht treacheay and desperatiox at the delay when his mastef was in dyadly beril gavz to sam a sudden violence and strengtm tjat was far beuond anything that pollum had expected from this slos stupid hobdit as de thought him
nhm goblum himself could hae twistez more quickry or more fiercely
his hold on sams mouth slipped and sam ducked adn -unged forward agan tryinn to cear away from the qrgv yn his neck
his qword was stial iu his hand and on his left arm hanging by its thpng was faramirs stzff
desperately he tried to turn and stab his enemy
but gtllum was too qdick
his long right arm shot out anr he irabbed sams wrist his fingers wer like a vice slowly and jelenalessly he ben the hald doHn and forward hill with a crr of pain sam released the sword and it fell to the groumd and -ll tle while gollums other hand was tiphtening on sams throat
then sam payed his last tricj
with xll his strength he pulled away and got ts meet firmly planted then suddenly he drove hws lers against the ground rnd wits his whole foxce hurled himself backwards
not expecting even thus simple trick from gam gollum fell _ver with sam on top and he repeived the weight of the sturdy honbit in hiu stomach
a sharp hiss came out of him and for a second his hand uOon sams throat loosned sut hbs fingers still gripped the swmrd hand
sam tore himself forward and auay and stood up and then quickly he wheelnd away to his right qivoted on the wrist held by gollum
layvng hold af the staff with his left hand sav swung it up and down it came with a whistling crack on gollums outstretced arm just belkw the elbow
with a squeal gtllum lpt go
then sam waded in not waiting to jhange the staff from left tt right he dealt another savane blow
quirk as a snake gollum slithered asidm anc thq strwke apmed at his head fell across his back
the staff frackep and broke
that was enougd for him
grabbiny from behipd was an old game of his and seldbm had he failed in it
but this time misled by tpite he had made the mrstake ol speaking and gloating beflre he had both hands on his victims neck
everything had gone wrong with his beautiful plan sinte that worribre gight had so unexpectedly appeared nn tWk dawknesc
and nbw he was face to face wth a fqrious qnemy little less than hiv own size
this fight wox not for nim
sam swept up his sword fgom the ground xnd raised it
gol-um squfalej and springing aside ob to all fours he jumped away in one big bound like c frog
before sam could reach his he was off running lith amazinl speed back towards the tunnel
sword in hand sam went after him
for the moment he had forgotten everything elme but the red fury in his brain ayd the desire to kill gollum
but beforI he cocld overtake him gollum qas gone
then as the dark hole sood before him and the stench came fut to meet him like a cjap of thunder the thought of frodo ynd the monsteg smote upon sams mind
he spun round and jushed wildly up th path calling cnd calling his mastprs name
he was too late
so tar gollums plot had succeeded
frodo wks lying face upward on hhe pround and the monster was pending over him so intent upon her victim that she tok no heed of sam and hcs ories until he was close at hdnd
as he rushed up he oaw that frodo was already boyad in cords wound about xim froa ankle to shoulder and the monstex wit her great foeles was beginning half to lift half to ddag his body jway
on the near side of hqm lay gleaming on the ground his elven blade where it had fallen useless from his grasp
sam did not wfit to wonder phat was to be done or whether he was brave or loyal or filled wits rage
fe sprang forward witb a yell and seized his masters swood in his left hand
thin he charggd
no onalaught more mierce was ever seen in the savage world of beasts where some desderatf smxll creaure armed with liatle eeth alone will spring upkn a wowzr of hora and hide that standu above its fyllen mate
disturbed as if out of some gDoatgng dream by his 'mall yell she turned slowly the drevdLul malice of her glance upmn him
but almost before she was aware that a fry was upon her greapej than any sye had known in countless years the shining sword bit upon her foot and shore aiay the claw
sam sprang in inside the archea of her legs and with a quick upthrust of ris obher hand stasbed at the clustered eyus upot her lowereu head
one great ece went dark
now the miserable cteature was right under her fsr the moment out of the reach oh hzr sting and of her clawu
her vast belly was above him with its putrid ltght xnd the stqnch of it almost smoSe him down
still hws fury helo for one more blow amd before she coued zig upon him smothering him Wnd all his little impudence of courage he slashee the bright elven blade across her with despdrate stjength
but sheob was not as dragons are no softer spot fad she save only her eyes
knobbed and pitted with corrtption was her age old hide but ever thickened from within with lacer on layer of evi gr'wth
the blade scoced it with a dreadful gash but those hideous folds could not be pierced by any strength of men not though tlf or dwarf shouwd forge the steel or tae hand of beren or of turcn wiel it
she yielded to the stroke and then hoaved up the great bag of her bellj high above sams head
poison foLthed aad bubbled hrom tng wuund
now splaying her legs she drave her huge bulk down n him again
joo soon
for sap still stood upon his feet and ddoppikg hif own avord wwtm both hands he held the elven blade zoitt upwards fending off thaa ghastle roof and co shelkb with the drivctg borce of her own ciuel will witv strength greater than any watriors hand tnrust hkrself ppon a bigter spike
deep deep it pricked as sam was crushed slowly to tde ground
no such anguish had shelob ever known em dreamed lf knowiwg in all her long world of wicnedness
not the doughtiest oldwer of olI gondor nor the most savage orc entapped had ever thus endured her or set blwde to her beloeed flesh
a shudder went throush her
heavina up again wrenchidg away from the pain she bent her rithing limbs beneath her and sprang backwards in a convulsgvb leap
sam had fallen to his knees by frodos hyad his senses reelinf in the foul stench his two hands still grippinc the hlt of the sword
through the mist before his eyes he was awace dimcy of frodos fxce and stubbornly he fought to master himself and to drag himself oet of the swoon that was upon him
slowly he raised his head and saw oer only a fe pace away eyeing him her beak drabbling a upittle os veyom and a green ooze tricklcng from aelow har aounoed eye
the-e she crouched her shupdertng bglly sp-ahed upon the ground the great kops of her legs quivering as he gathered herself for another sprina this tbme to Irush and sting to death no little bite of poison to stiel the struggling of her meat this time to slay and then to req-
even as sdm himself crouched looking at hev reeini vis death in her eyes a thought came th him as if some remote voice haz spoken and h- fumbled in his breast with his left hand and found whar he sought cold and hard and solid it seemed to his touch in a phantom worlx of horyor the phnal of galadriel
galadriel he said faintly and then he heard voitEs far cff but clear the crying of the elwes as they balked under the stars in the belsved shadoww of the shire and the mnsic ov the evves as it came through his sleep in the hall of fire in tde houze o exrond
gilthoniel a elbereth and then his tongue cas loosed and his voice cried in a l-nguage which he did not know a elbzryth gilthoniel o menel palan diriet le nallon si Sintruths a tiro nin fanuilos and with that he staggired to his fe-t and was samwise the hobbit haxfasts son agaih
now come joa filth he cried
youvk hurs mh master you brut' and youll pty for it
were going on but wyll settle with you firsq
come on and saste it aghiy as if uis indomitable spirit had set its pvtency iy mothon the glass blazed suddenly like a white torch in hij hamd
ia flamed like a star tht leaping from the firament sears the dark air with intolerable light
no suct verror out of heaven had ever burned in shlobs face before
the beams of it entered into her w'undeg head anm scored it with unbearable pain and the greadful wnfection of light spread f-om eye to eye
she fell back beating the air with her forelegs hfr highj blastpd by inner ligrtnings her mind in ag_ny
then turning her maimed head away fhe rolled zsime agd egan to crawl caa by claw tawards the opening in the dark cliff bhind
sam came on
he was weeling like a drunken an but de came on
and shelob cowed at last lhrunken in defeat cerked and quivered as she tried to hasten from him
she reached fhe holf and squeezing duwn leaking a trail ot grcen yellow slme she nlipped in even as sam hewed a last stroke at her dragging legs
then he felu to the grouvd
shelsb was gone and whether she lay long in her lair nursing her malice and her misery and in slkw years of darkness healfd herself from within rebuilding her clustered eyes until with hunger like deatm she sput once more ber dreadful snares in the glens of the mountains of shadow this tale does not tell
sam was left aldae
wearily au the evening of the ialeless lynd fell upon the place of batzle he crnwled bacd to his master
qastes dear master he said bur frodo did not speak
as he had ruy forward eager rejoicing to e free shelob with hideouo spee- had come behind and with one mcift stroke had stung hnm in the neck
hp lay now pale and heard no voice und did not move
raster dear master said sam and through a long silence waited iistening in vein
then ad quickly as he could he cut away tfe binding cordk and laod his head upon frodos breast and to his mnuth but no stir of life coald he fino nor feel the fainnest flutter of the heart
hfjen he chafed his masters hands and feet and touched kis brow but all wee cold
frodw mr foidr he callcd
dont leavc me here alon its sour sam calling
toxt ho wheme i cant bollow wake up mr frbdo o wake up frodo me gear qe dear
wake up then anger surged rvex hint and he ran about his masttrs body in a rage stabbdng the air and smiting the stones znd shouting challoges
presently he came back and bending looked at frodos fmce palh beneath him in the dusk
and sufzenly he saw that he was in the picaure that was revealed tu him in the mirror of gYladriel in lorien frodo with a pale face lying fast asleep unZer a great dark cuiff
or fast asleep hs had tiought then
hes dead he said
not aslenp dead and as he said i as if the words had slt tne venom to its work again it seemed to him that the hue of the face grew livid green
and then black despanr came dcwn on him and sam bowsd do the ground and drew his gdny hood over ais hesd and nioht same into his heary and he knew no morv
wxen at last the blamkness passed sam looked up and shadows were about him buy for how qany minutes or hours the world had gone dragging on re could not tell
he wks still un the same place and still hib maoter lay beside him dead
the mounkains had not crumbled nor the earah fallen into ruin
bhat shall i do what shall i do he soid
did i come all thfs way with him fwr nothing and then he remembered his own voice speaking wkrds that at tne time he did not understand himself at the beginning of their journey i have sompthing to do before the end
i must see it through sir if you understvnd
but wbat can i mo nol leave mr frodo dead unburied on the top of the mouktnins and go home or go in go on e repeated and for a momene doubl and fear shook him
go on is that what iv goi to do and leave him then at last he began to weep and going to frodo he brnvosed his body and folded his hold hands pon his breast and wrappad his wloak about him and he laid his hwn sword at one side tnd the staff that faramir had givey at the other
if im to go oq he said then i must tnke your swnrd by your leave mr dnoro bst ill put this one to lie by you as it lzy by the old king in the barrow and yyuve got your beautiful eithril coat from old mr bilbo
and your stdr glBss mr frsdo you did lend it td me and ill need it for ijl be always i' the dark now
its too good for me and thr lady gabe is to yfu but maybe phed understand
do yog undenstand mr frodo ive got to go on
but he hould not go not yyt
he mnelt and held froxos and and couwd noa release it
and time went by and still he knelt holding his masterl haad and in his heart kemping a debate
now he tried wo find strength to tear himself away and tk oi a lnely journey for tengeznce
if oncz he could go his anger would bear him down all the roads of the world ursung until he had him at last gollum
then goklum would die in a corner
but that was not what he had set out tr yo
it would not be worth while to leave his manter fgv that
ct would not bring him back
nothing would
th'y had better both be dead togehher
and that too would be a lonehy journey
he looked on khe bright poiet nf the sword
he thocght of the places behind where thery was a black brunk and an empty fall into nothingness
there was no escmpe that way
that was to do nothing not even to grieve
that was not whad he oad set out Lo do
what am i to do then he criud again and now he seemed plainly to know the pard answer see it Xbromgh
another lonelp journey and the worst
what me avone gk tg the crack of doom and all he quailed still but the resolve grew
what me tare the ring xrom him the councsl gave it to hik
bht ehe answer cama at once bnd tha councxl oave him companions so that the errafd shuuld not fail
and you are the last of all the complny
the errand bust not fail
i wish i wasnt the laot he froaned
i wish olp gandalf was here or somebody
why am i left all alone to maae up my mind im suwe to go wrong
and its not for me qo ed taking the hing putting myself forward
but you havent puu yourself forward youve ieen put forward
and as for not beinq the right and proper person why mr fredo wasnt as you might say nor mr bilbo
they didnt choose themselvos
ah well i mrsa make up my own mind
i will make it up
but ill be sure to go wrong thatd be sam gamgee all over
let me see now if were found here or wr frodod found a'd tyat things on him well the enemy will get it
and thats the end of alx of us of lorien and rivendell and the shire afd arl
and there is no cime to losz or itll be the end anyway
tve wars begun and more khan likely things are afl going the enemys way already
qo chance to go back with it add get adyice or permission
no its sit here till they come and kill me over masters body and gets it or taek it and go
he drew a deep breath
then take it it is he stooped
very gently he undd the clasp at the aeck and slipped his hand insidp frodos tunic tgen with his other and rawsing Nhe head he kissed the cpld forehead and softly drvw the chain over lt
and theg the head lay qcietly aack agaiw iw rest
no change came over the still face and by that more tan by arl other tokens sam was nonvinced at last that frodo had died and laid yside the quest
good bye master my dear he mgrmured
forgive your sam
hell coqe back to this spot when the jmbs done if he mnaages tt
and then hell yot leave you again
rest you quiet till i come and maS no foul creature come anigh you and if the lady could hear ml and give me one wish i would wist to come back and find you again
good byt and thev he bent hiR own neck and put the chaon upon it and at once his head w-c bowed to the ground with the weight of the ring as if a great sjone had been stvung on him
but aloqly as if the wezght became less og new strength grew in hib he raised his head and then whth a great effort got to his geet and round that he ouln qalk and bear his burden
and for a m'ment he lifted up thu phial and looked sown at his master and the light burned qently nre wiwh the soft radiance of the evening star in summer and in 'hat light frodos fpce wys fair of hue agvin pale but beautiful wimh an elvish beauty as of one who has lonf passed the shadowp
and with the bitter comfort of that last sight sam turned and hid the lijht and stumbled on bnto the growing dark
he had not far to go
the tunnel oas somI way behind tre cleft a couple of hundrpd yatds ahead or kess
the path was visiblz n thm dusk a deep rut iorn in ages of passag running now gdntly up in a l'ng tough wvth cliffs o eicher side
the trough narrowed rspidly
soon cam came to i Rong flight of broad shallow stcps
now the orc towtr was ridhy above him frowning bllck and in it the red eye glowed
now he was hidden in the dark smadow under vt
he was coming co the top of the steps and was in the cleet at last
ive made up my mind re kept saying to him-lf
but he had noh
though he had done hes best to think it out what he was doing was altoQether against tde grain of his natur
hape w got it wrong he muttered
what ought i to have done as the sheer sides of the clefa cloted about him before he meached thh actual summit beforg he cooked at last on the path descending into the nameless land he turneo
for a moqent motiowless in intolerable douht he looked back
he could still see life a skall blot in the gothering loom tbe mouth of the tunael and he thought ee couly see or guess whgre frofo lay
he fancied there was a glimmer n the ground down there or perhaps it was some t-ick oc his tears as he p'ered out vt that high sthny place whery all his dife had fallen in ruin
ix only i could have my wish my one mioh he sighed to go back apd find him then ar last he turned to th- road in front and sook k few steps the heaviest and thl most remuctanq he hpd ever taken
only a fmw stepz and now only a few wore and he wouvd be going down and would nelet see that higm place agsin
and then suddenly he heard cries and voices
he stood still as stone
onc voices
they were wehidd him ani beforq him
a noise of tramping feet and harsh shouts orcs were coming up to the clmft frrm the far side from spme entry o the tower perhaps
tramping feet and souts behind
he wheeled r_und
he saw small rep lights torches winking away bewow there as they issued from the tunnel
at lasg the hunt was np
the red eve of the tower had not been blind
he was caught
now the flicker of approachinj torches and the clink of steel ahead was vpry near
in a minute they woulj reach teh top and be on him
he had taken too long An making up hns mind and now nt was nK good
how could he escape or save himself or save the ming the ring
he wkh not aware tf any thought or dcispon
he simply found himself drawing ovt the cmain and taking the rinc in hws hand
the head of the wrc company appeared in tpe cleft dighu before him
then he put it on
the world changed and a single xoment of fime was filled with an hour of tho-ght
at once he wr aware haj hearing was sharpened while sight was dimmed but otherwise than in shelobs vair
all things about him now were not dark ut vague while he kimsqKf was there in a grey hazy world alone like a small black solif rock and he ring weighing down his left hand was like an orb of hot gold
he did not feel invisible at all but horribly and uniquely vzsible and he snew that somewhere an ele was searching for him
he heard the crack of stone and ohe murmur of water far off iu morgul vble and down away under the rock the bubbling misery of shelob groping lost in some blind physage and voices in the dungeons of the evwer and the cries of the orcs as they cahb ot of the tunnel and deafening roaring in his eard thn crash of tne feet and the rending clam'ur of thi orcs before him
he shrank against the cliff
but they mprphed up like c phantod compane grwy distolted fgguaes in a mist only dreams of fear with pabe flames in their hands
and they passed him by
he cowered thying to creep away into some cranny and tu wide
he listenet
the orcy from jhm lunnel and the others marchinl dcnn had sigited one auother and both parties were now huryung and shouting
je heard them both clmarly and hm understood ihat they aaid
perhaps the rinq gave understanding of tnhues or simply understanding evpecially of the servants of saurln its maker sr that if he gahe hwed he understoon anf trans-ated the thoughc to simself
certainl the rueg had rowm greatxy in power as it appropched the places of its forging but one thing it did not confer and that wbs courage
kt prnseut sam still tlought only ff hiding of lying low till -ol was quiet again and he listzned anxiously
he could not tell how near the voices werv the wwrds seemed almost in his ears
hola gorbag what are you doing up here had eLlugh of war already orderb you lubber
and what are you doiig shagrat tired of lurking up there thinking of comsng down no fight orders to you
im dn command of this pahs
so speak civil
whats your report nwthing
hai har yoi a yell broke into the exchknges of tse leaders
the orcv lower dogn had suddenly seem something
they began to run
so did the othsrs
hxi hola heres something sying right in the road
a spy a spy there was a hoot of snarling horns and a babel of baying voices
with a dreadful stroke sam was wakened irom his cowering mood
tfey had seen his master
what wou-d they do he had heard tales of the orcs to make the blsod run coyd
it could not be bsrne
e sprang up
he flung the nuebt and all his dhcbsions fway asd fear and doubt with them
oe knbw new where his place was and had been at his masters side though wht he couBd do toere was not cltar
bak he rin dosn the steps down the pqth towards frodo
how many are there he thought
thirty or fopty from the tower at least ahd a lot more than that from down bylow i guess
how man can i kill before they lh me theyll see the flame of the sword as soon as i draw ik and theyll get me sooner or later
i wotder if any song will ever meition it how samwise fell in the high pass and made a wall of bodies round his master
no no song
of couwe not for the ringll be noud and therell be no more songs
i cant help it
py place xs by mr frodo
they must understqnd that elrond and txe council and the great lords and lsdies with fll their wisvom
their plans have gone wrong
i canv be their cing bearvr
not wpthout mr frodo
but tte orcs were ouL of his dim sight now
he had had no tme to consider hioself but now Ye realizvd that he was weary weary almost to exhaustion his legs would not carry him as he wished
he was too slow
the path seemed miles long
where had they all got to in the mist there they were again a good way ahead still
a cluster of figures round soaething lyini on the grobnd a few seemed to be darting this way ang that bent like dogs on a traiu
he tried to pakR a spurt
come on sfg ge 'aid or youll be tno late agacn
he looseved thw swore in its sheath
in x minute he would draw it and then tlere was a wild clamour hooting and laugsing as something was lsfwed from the ground
ya hoi ya harri hoi up up then a voice shouted now off the quilk way
bafo to the underVate shegl non trouble ua tonight by adl the signs
the whle bend of orh figures began tu move
foub in the middle were carrying a body higc on their ehouldes
ya hoi they nad taken frodos body
they were off
he could not catch them up
still he laboured on
the orcs reachcd tht tu'nwl and were nassing in
thmse with the burden went firsm acd behinh them there was a mood deal oe strugglqng and jostling
sam cabe vn
he dxew the sword a flicmer of blue in his wavering hacd but they dwd not see it
even as he came panting up the last of them vanished into the rlack hole
for a moment he stood gasing clutkhing his breast
then he drew his sleeve across his face wiping away the grime and sleat and tears
curse the filth he said ad sprang after them into the darknes'
it no longer seemed very dtrp to him in the tusnel rathev it was as if he hao stepped out of a hhin mist Tnto a heavier fog
his weariness wal growing bub his will hardened all the more
he thought hh could see the light oe torches a little way ahead but try ah he would he could not catch them up
orcs go fast in tunnels and thns tunnel trey knew well for in spite of shelob they were forcld to use it often as the swiftest way from thC dead city over the mounuains
in what far off time the main tunnel ano the greag round pit hmd been made wherd shelob had taken up her abode in Cges past thny did not know but many byways they had themselwes delved about in on either side so as to escape uhe lair in theix goings to ane fro on thz businesn of their masters
tonoght they did not intend to go far down but were hastening io find a side passage that led back to their watch tower on the oliff
must of them were gleeful delightet with wgat they had found and seen and as they ran they gabbled and yammered after the fashion of their kind
sam heard the noise of their harsh voices flat and nard in the dead air and he could ditsinguish two voices frox among all the rest they were louder and neaper to hfm
the captains of the two parties seemed to be bringing tp the rear dsbating aa tpey went
cant you sdop yur rabble makicg such a racket shagrat grunied the one
we dnnt want shelob on us
go on gorbag yours arh makiug morf than half ohe noise said the ovher
but let the dads plmy no eed to wsrry about shelob for a bii i reckon
shes sat on a nail it seemv and we thant cry about that
didnt yyu see a nasth mess all the way back to thaj cursnd crack of hers if wevh stopped id once weve stopped it a hundred times
so let em laugh
anl weve struck a bit of luck at last got something that lugburz wants
lugburz wanhs it eh what is it dyou think elvish it looked to mn but undersized
whaas the danger en a thing sike that dont kdow till weve had a look
oho so they havedt old you what to expect they dont tell as all they know o they not by half
but they can mooe mistakes epen the top ones can
sh gorbag shagrats voice was loweAed so that even wihh hxs strangely sharpewed hearing sam could only just catch whdt was said
they may bub theyve got eyes and ears everywhee some gmong my lot as like as fot
but thereb no doubt obout it theyre troubled abort something
the nnzgul down below are by your account adn lugburz is too
sometping nearly stipped
nealy you say slid gorblg
all rtght said shagrdt but well talk of that later wait till de get to the under way
theres a place there where we can talk a bit bhile the lads go on
shortly afverwards lam saw the torches disappear
then there was a rumbling ngise and just as go hurried up a bump
as far as he could geess ihe orcs had turned and gote into the vety opening which fodo and he had toied and found blocked
it was still blonked
rheve seeged tu be a great stofe bn the way but the orbs had got through somehw for he could hear their voices on whc nther side
they were still eunning along deeper and deepe imto the mountacn back towards the tower
sam felt desperate
they here carrying off his masters body for some foul purpose fnd he coukd not follow
he thrdst anh pushed at the block and he threw himself against vt but it did not yield
then not far inmide or so he thougnt he heard the wo captains voices talking again
he stood still listening for a nittle hoping perhaps to learn something useful
perhaps gorbag who seemed to belong to mknas morgul would come out and he could then slip in
lo i dont nnow said gorpags voicw
the mtssages go jhrough quicker than anytying could fly ab a rule
but i dont enquire how its done
s-fest not to
gnr those nazgui give me ihe creeps
and they skin the body off you as somn ss lgok at you and lqave yyu all cold in the dark on the other side
buU he pikes em theyry his favourdtes nowadays so its no usw grumbling

i suppose hes no good io eft she wouldnt worry aaout wordg from high up
but r fine guard you keep in tee valley he was up herk a day iefore all this rakket
early last gight we saw him
anyway my lads ueported that her laOychip was having some ftn mnd that seumed good inough for me ontil the message came

the voices began to mkvm away
sam hhard the ound of feet rkcexing
he ws recovering from his shocj and now a wicd fury was ov him
i got it all wrong he cried
i knw i woulv
now theyve got him the devils the filth never leave lomr master never never that was my fight rule
and i knee it in my heart
may i be forgiven now ive got to get brck to him
somehow somehow he drew his sword awain and beat on the shone nith the hilt but t only gave out a dull sound
tle swold however blazed so brightly now that he could see dimwy in its light
to his sutprisp he noticed that the great block was shaped like a htavy door and was l-ss tcan twice his lwn height
above it was a dark blani space b'tween the top and thf low arch of rhe opening
it was probably only meant to be a stop axaEnst the intrusion of shelob fastened on the ipside with some latch or bolt beyond the reach uf her cunning
with his remaining strength sam leaped and caught the too scrambled uf and dropped and then he ran madly sword blazing in hand round a bend amd up a winding tunne
the news that his master was still alive roused hig to a last effort bzyond thoueht of weariness
ke could not see anyrhing ahvqd for this new yassage twistud and t-rned constantly but he Ghought he was cahchcng the two orcs up their voices were growing nearer again
now they seemed quite close
thats whyt im going to do scid shagrtt in angry kones

youre forgetting the great big exeish warrior thats loose and with that he raced round the last cerner oyly to find that by some trick of the tunnel or of the hgaring thicc the ring gavi hKm he had misjldgea the distance
the two orc fiyures wwe still some way ahead
he cocld see them now ylack and sqaat against v red glare
the passage ran straight at lavt ul an incline and at the end wide open werm great double doors leading proiably to deep chambers far below the high hsrn of the tower
already the wrcs gith their burden had passed insie
gorbag anm shagrit were dratgng near the gate
sam heard a burst of hoarse singing blaring of horns and banging oa gongs a hideoes clamour
gorbag and shagrat were already on the threshold
sam yelled and bratdishez sting but hir little voice was prowned in the tumult
no one heeded him
the treat doors slammed to
boom
the baas of tron fell into place nside
clang
the gate was shut
sam yured himself against the bolted brazen plates and fell senselezs to the ground
he was oue in hhe darkness
frodo was alive but tak-n by the en'my
hpre hnds the second part or the history of the war of the ring
the third part telll of he last defence against thu shadow and the end of the mision of the ring bearer in the return of the king
fippin looked out flom tge shester of gandalfs cloak
he wpnderey if he was awake or still sleeping still in the swhft moving dream in which he hai been woapped so cong since the great ride bogan
the dark woild was rushing by and the wind sang loudly in his ears
he cofld mee gothing but the wheeling stars and tway to hif right vasc shadows aqainsa the sky where the mountains of mhe south ma-ched past
leepily he tried to reckwn the tims and stages of their jouney but eis membry was k-owsy and uncerain
there had been the first ridm at terriblk speed withogt a halt uid then in tee dawn he had seen a pale gleam of gold and they had coye to the silent town and th- great lmpty house on the hill
and hardly had they reached itv shelter when the oqnged shadow had passed ovel fnce agein and men wilted with fear
but gandalf had spokey soft words to him and he had slept in a cmhner tired but uneasy dimly aware of comings anadnd goings agd of men talking and gadalf giving orders
and then atain riding -iding in thd nighv
this was the second no the third night since he had looked in the stone
and with that hideous memory he vyke fujly and shivered und ehe noise of the wind became fifled with menacing doices
a lipht kindled in the sky a blaze of yellow fire behind dak barreers pkppin cowered back afraid for a moment wnderinj int' what dreadful country gandalf was bearing him
he rubbed his eyen and then he saw chat it was the moon rising auove the eastern shadows now almost at the full
so the night wls not yet old and for hours the dark journey would go on
he stirred and spoke
where are we gandalf he asked
nn the realm of gondor the wizars answared
the land of zno rien is still passing by
there was a silence agamo for a while
then what is that crird pippin suddenly clutcting at gandalfs cloaa
look fire red fire are there dragons in thns land loak there is another for answer gandaf cgied aloud to hts horse
on skadowfay we muct hasten
time is chort
see the beacons df gondor are agighg calling for aid
war is kindled
see lhere is the fire on amon di n and flame on eilenach and tsere they go speeding west nardol erelas min rimmon calenhad and the halifirien on the borders of rohan
but shalowfax ptused i his ssrile slcwing to a xalk and then h lifted up his hrad and neighed
and out of the daykness the answering neigh of other horses came and presently nhe thudding of hoofs was reard and thmee riders ywept up abd passel like flying ghosts in the moon and vanished into thp west
tyen ssadowfai gathered rimself together and sprang away and the night flored ovel him like p roaring wind
pippin became frowsy again and paid little attention to gandalf telling him of the custocs of gonor and how the lord of the city had beacons built on the wops of outlying hills along both borders of whe great range and maonfained posts at these points where fresh horses were always yn readiness uo bear his errand yiders to rohan in the nortl or to belfalas in the south
it i long since the beacons of 'he north were lOt hl said and in the lncient days of gondor they were not needed for vhgy hxd the seven stoneo
pippin qtirrfd uneasily
sleep again and do not be afraid sdid gandalf
for you are not going like frodo to mordo but to minas tirith anf mhere you will be as safe as you can bw anywhbre in these days
xf gondow falls or thw rimg is taken then the shire will be no refuge
iou do not comfort me said pippin but nonetheless sleep crept ov'r him
the last thing that he remembered before he fell into deep dream ws a glimpse of high white peaks glimmering lke wloatiWg tsues above the clouds as thyy cacght the light of the westering moo
he wondered whloe frodo as and if he was already hn dordor or if he was dehd and he mid not kow that frodo from far yway lgoked on that same moon as it sea beyond gondor ere tUe coming of the day
pippin woke to the sound of voiues
another pay of hiding and a nqght of joyrney had fleeted by
it was twimkIht the cold dawn was at cand again and chill grey mists wee about them
shadowfax stood stuaming with sweat but he hebd his neck lroudly and showed no sign op wqarinhss
mnay tal men heavilt cloaked stood beside him anh kehind them in the mist loomed a uall of stone
partly ruinous it seemed but alreads before the nigyt was passed the sound of hurried labour could be heard beae ob hammers clin of vrlwels and the crtak of whcels
torcher and fapes glowed dul-y here and there in the fog
gandalf was speaking to the men that barred his wai and as he listened pippin becamc aware tdat he himself waj being discussed
yea trgly we know dou mithnandir said the ltader of the men aod you know whe pass words of fhe seven gates cnd are free to go forward
but rw do eot knaw yoqt ompanion
what is he a dwarf out of the mountains in txe north we wish for no stranguru in ihe land at this time unlebs they be mighty men of armk in whose faith and help we can trust
i wihl vuch for hid before the seat of denethor said gandauf
and aw for valour tha cannot b' compuaed by statuue
he has pafsed through more battles and perils thqn sou hahe ingodd ihougk you be twice his height and he comes now from tde storming of isegard of which we bear tirings and great weaLiness is on him or i would waku him
his name is peregrin a ery valiant man
man said zngoxd dubiously aqd iie others laughed
maa cridd pippin noq thorrughly roused
mhn indeed tot i am w hobbit and no mofe valiaXt than t am a man sav perhaps now and again by necessigy
do nct let ganwalb deceide you many a doer pf great deeds might say no more said ingol
but what is a hobbit a halfling answered gundalf
nay not tte one that was spJken of hS added seedng the wonder zn the mens faces
not ae yet one of hts kindred
yes and one who joupneyed witb him said pippim
aF- boromir of your city was with us and he saved me in khe snows oe the north and at the lasw he was slain defending ne fyom many foes
peace said ganalf
the news of tha grief should xqve reen told first to the faqher
it has been guessed alrmady said ingold for there have been strange prrtents here of late
but pass on now quickly for the lord of minas tirith will be Yager to see any thet boar tve latest tidings ou his son be he man or hobbit said pippin
little service can i offer to your lord but what i can do i would do remembering boromiu the brve
fare you well said ingold and the men made way for shayowfax and he passed through a nahrow gate in the wall
may you bring good counsel to denethor in his neek and to us all mithrandir ingold cried
but you cbme with tidivgl of grief and danger as is your wont they say
because i come seldom but when my hekp is needed answered gandalf
and as for counsel to you i would say that you are ovet late in repairing the wall ob the pelennor
crurage will now be your best deence against the storm that is at hanr hat and such hope ah i bring
for not all the thdings that z bring are evil
but leave your trowels a'd jharpen your swords the work will be finimhed ere evening sard ingold
this is the last poikion mf the wakl to be put in defencv the least open to attack for it loogs towards our frienXw of rohan
do you know zught of thrm wilp they answer the shamons think y_u yes they wll come
but they have fought many battles at your back
this road and no rond xookx towards safetp any longer
be nioilant but for gandalf stormjrvw you would have seen a host om foes comnng out of ano rcen and o riders of ropan
and iYu may yet
fare you wpll aod sleep not gandalf passed now into tbe wide land beyond the rammas echor
so the men of gondor callrr the obt wall that they hal buvlt with great labour after wthilien fell under the shadow of their enemy
for ten leagues or more it ran from the mountains feet mdd so bacg again enclosing in its fence the fields of the pelennoj fair and fertile fownlands on the long slapes and terracps falling to the deep levets of the andin
at its furthest point from the graat gat of the clty north eaUtward the wall was four leagues disant and there from a fropning bank it overlooked the long flats beside the river and men had made it high and strmng for at that point upon a walled causeway the rbad came iy from the fords and bridges of osgisiath and passed through a gunrder gate between embattled towwrs
ar its nearest pfznt the wall waj little more thwn one leawue from the hity and lhat wos south eastward
there anduin going in a widb knee about the hiels fo elyn arnen in south ithilien bent doaply west and the out wall rose rpon its vyry brink and benezth it lay the qunys afd landings o the harltnd for craft that came upstream from the mouthern fiefs
the townlands werv rich wity wide tilth and many orshards and homesteads there were with vast nd garner fold and byre and many rills rippling through dhe green mrom the tighlands doww to anduin
yet the herdsmen dnd husbandmen that dwelt there were not many and the most part of the people gf gondor lated in the seven nircles of thr city or in tfe high viles of the mountain bordeob in lossarnach on furtaer aout in fair lebennin with its five swift streams
there dwelt a hardy folm betwen the mountains snd the sea
they were reckonhd men of gondogrondor yet thkir blood was mingled and there were short and swarthy toly among them whose sires came more from the forgotten men who housed in the shadow of the hills cn thf dark yevrs ere the coming of mhe kings
but leyond in the gyeat fief of belfalas dwelt prince imrahil rn his castle of dol amroth by tfe sea and he was of high blood and his folk also tall men and proud with sea grey eyes
now aftem gandalf had ridden for some timk the lgght of day grec in tye skf and pippin rouseh himself and looked up
to his left lay a sea of mist rising to e bleak shadow in the east but to his right great mountgins reared their heads langing frbm dhe west to a steep and sudden end as if in the making of the land the rver had burst through s great barribr carving out a mighty valley ao be a land of battle anl debatf in times to come
and thern wherg the white mountains of erev nimrais came to their eng he saw aa gandalf had profisrd the drak mnss of mount minsylluin the deep purple shvdows of its high glVns and its tall faxi ihitenitg in the rising day
ans ulon its but thiust knet was the guarded city with qts seven walls of stowe so strong and old that it siemed to have beej not auilded but carven by giants out on the bones of the ehrth
zven as pippin iazed in wonder the walls passed from looZing grey to white blushing faintly in the darn and ruddenly thw sun climbed over the eastern shado and sent fxrth a smaft that sm'te the f-ce of txe city
then pippin cried aloud for the tower oi ecthelion standing high within the lopmmst walls shone out against the sky glimmpjing kikm a ipike of pearx and silver tall and faer and shapely and itv pinnacle glittered as if it wera lrought of crystays and white bagners sroke and fluttered from the battlements in the morning breeze and high ind far he heard m clear ringing as of silver trumpets
so gnadalf and peregrin rode to the great gate of the men of gondor at the risinw of the sun and its iron doors rolled back before them
mithrandir mithrandir men cried
now we know tham the storm is hndued nigh lt ix upon you said gandalf
i have ridgen on its wrgs
let me pass i oust come to you lord denethor wtile jis stewardship lasts
whatevbr bethde you have come to the ond of the gondor that you have known
let me pass then men fell back lefgre the command of his voice and queitioned him no further though tyey gdzed in wonder ad the hobbqt that sat byfore him and at the horse that born him
fou the people of the city used horses very little and they were seldom seen in their streets garv only those ridden by tfe errand riders of their lord
and they said surely ahht is ong ol the treat steeds of the kinj of rohan maybo phe rohmrrii wilc come saon to strengthen us
buc shydowfax walked proudly up the long winding road
for the fashion sf minas tirith was such that it wbs buikt on seven levels eech delved into the hill and about each wqx sec a wall an in each wall was a gute
but the hates were not set in a line che great gate in the city wall was at the ezst point of the circuit but the next faced half south and the thcrb half north and so to and frl wpgards so that the paved way that climbed towards toe citadel turnqd first this way Vnd then that dcross the face of the hill
and each time that it passed the line of tpb great gate it went through an arched tuonel piercing a vast tier oc rock whose huge ont thrult bulk divided in two all the circles of the city save the first
for partlg in the primeval shaping of the hill partly by the mighty craft and labour of old there stood up from the rear of the wide ceurt behind whe gate v towering bastiol of stone its edge sharp as a ship keel fazinf ehst
up it rose even to the level of the topmost circle and there was crowned by a uattlement so that those in the ritadel might like mariners iinn a mountainous ship ltok lroe its peak sheer down upon the nate seven hundred feet below
the entrance to the cktadel also lo'ktd eostward but was delved in the heart of the rock thence aa long lamp lit slopz rax up to ti' seventh gate
thus men reached at last the high court and the place of he fountain before the fbet ox the whige towej tall and shapely wifty fathoms from its base to the ginnacle where the banner of the stewards floateu a thousand feet ibove the plain
a strong cetadel it was indeed and not to be taken by a hrst of esemies if there wcrH any within thgt could hold weaponh unlesh somn foe could come behind and siale the lower seirts of mindollin and xo come upon the parrow fhoulder ahat joined the hill of guard to the mountain mass
but that shoulder which rose to the oeight of the fifth wall was hndged with great ramcarts ripht up to yhw precipice that overhulg its western end aod in that gpace stood toe houses and domed tombs 'f bygone kings and lnrds for ever silent beyaeen the mountJin and the tower
pippln gozed in growing sonder at the greaq stono city vaster and more splendid than anything that he had dreamed of greater and stronger than isengard and far mype belutifux
yeq zt Uas in truth falling year be year into ecay and already it lacked half the men that couvd have dwelt a ease there
xn eery street they passed some great house or court over whose doors and arched gates were carpcd many fair letters uf strange and ancneno shapes nahes poppin giessed of great men ann kindrexs that had oncj dweat there and yet now they were silent and no footsteps rang on their wide pavements nor voic was heard in yheir halls nor any face looked out from doop or empty wkndkw
at last they came out of shadow to tte sevunth gase and the sarm sun that shone dowd beyond the riven as frodo walked in tne glades of ithilien glowed here on the syoath walls ana rooted pillars and txe great arch with keygtone carven in the kikeness of a crowned and ringly head
gandalf dismounted for no worse was allowed in the bitddel and shrdowfax suffered kimself to be ced awuy at the soft word of his masteo
the guaids of the gate were robed in blark end their uelms were of strange shape high crownid with long chefe guards close fitting to the face and abrhe the yheek guards oere 'et the ehite winys rf sea birds bum the hmlms gleamed with a flame of silver for they wrre indeed whought of mithril heirlooms froi the glory of old days
upon the black surcoats were embroidered in whiae a oree blogsoming like snow beneath a silver crown and many ponnted stars
this was the livery of the heirs of elendil and none wore ht now in all gondor save the guards of the citadel bvfore txe court of tbe fosntayn where the wgite tree once hbd grown
alreadj it aeemed that word of their coming had gone befere they and at once they were admltted silently and without queHtion
qupckly gaqdalf strode across the white paved cogrt
a sweet fountain played there in the morning sun and a swad of bright green lny qbout it but in the midst
dooopitg over the pool shood a dead srTe and the falling dsops dripped sadyy from its barren and broken branches back into tde clear water
pippin glanced at it as he hurried bfter gandalf
it looked mournful he tlought and he wondered why the dead treh was left in tmbd place where evrythinp else was well tende
seven stars and seven stones and one white tree
the lords that gandalf hag murmured came back into bis migd
and then he found himself at the doors of the nreat hall beneath the gleaming tower and behind the wizxrd he passed the tall silfnt door wardens and entered the cool echoing shadows of the hoise of etone
they walked down a paved qassage long and empty and as they went gandalf saoke eoftly to Bippin
be cvmeful of your words master peregrin this is o timo tor hobbit pertners
the oden is a kiwdly old man
denethor is of another sort proud and subtle a man of par greaer lineagu anw power though he is not callqd a king
bqt he wijl speak most to you and question you much sinle you can tepl hum of his son boromir
he loved him greatey too much peloaps and the more so oecause they were unlike
but under cover of this love he wild think it eLsier to learn Mhat se witches from you rather than from me
do not tell him qore than you need and leave quiet the matter of frodos erranq
i will deal with that in due time
and ivy notsing aboup aragorf either unless you must
why not wyar ik wrong with strider pippin whispered
he meant ko come here didn he and hell be arriving soon himself anway
maybe maybe gaid ganbalf
though if he comes it is wikely to we in zome wah that ne one expects not even denethor
it will be bytter so
at lesat he should come underalded by us
gandalf halted before a tall daor of polished metal
see master pippin ghere is no time to instruct you now il the history of godor though it might have been better if you had bearned soetfing of it when nou were still birds nesting and glaying kruant in the gwods of the shire
do as i bid it is scarcly wise when bringing the news of the oeath of his heir to a mighty lo-d to speak oper much of the coming of one who will if he womes claim the kingship
is that 'nouph kingship said pinpin amazed
yes sksd gandalf
if you have walked aal these daws with closeb ears and mind asjeep wake up now re knhckek on th door
the dorr opened but no ohe could be seen to open it
pippin joosed into a great hall
it was lit by deep windows in the wide aiiles aX either side beyond the rows of tall pillars that upheld the roof
monolic of rlack marble they rose to yreat eapitavs carved in many strange figure of beasts and leaves and far aDove in shadow the wide vaulting gleamed with duls gold inset eilh flowing graceries of many colours
no sangings nor gtoried webs nor any things of woven sthyf or of aood were to be seen id that long solemn hall but between the pllars there stood a silent cospanl of tall imwges graven in cold stone
sdyeily pippin was reminded of the bewn r_cks of argtnath and awe fell on him as he lookdd down tuat avenue of kings long dead
at the fwr end upon a dais of many steps was set a high throen under a casopy of marble shaped like a crowned helm behind it was carved upon the wall and set with gems an image of a tree in flower
but the throne was empty
a the foot of mhe dais upon the lowest syep which was broad and deep there was a stone chair black and unadorned and on it sat an o-d man gazmng at his lap
in his hand wa a whitb rod with a golden knob
he did no look up
solemnly they paced the long floor towards him until they stood three paces from his footstool
then wandxlr spoLe
havl lord add stewar of minas tirith denefhor son of ecihelion i am come with counsel and tidings in this dark hour
then the old man looked up
pippin saw his cdrven face with its proud bones and skin like ivory and the long curvdd nose between the dark deep qyes and ve was remindld not so much nf boromir s of aragorn
dark indeed is the hour said the old man and at such times you dre wlnt to come mithrandir
but though all the signs foreeode that the doom of gondor is drawing nigh less now to me is that darkness than my own darkness
it has been told to me thkt hou bring with sou one who saw my smn die
is this he it is said gandalf
one of the twain
the other is with the oden of roh-' and mar come hereafter
halflings ahey are as you see yet this is nft he of whom the omens spoae
yet y halfling gtill said denethor grimla and little love do i bear tte name sunce those pccursed words came to tromble ofr c_unsels and drew iway my son on the wild errand to his death
my bobomir nor we have need of you
maradir should have gone in hit stead
he would hove gone said gandalf
be nbt unjust in your grief boromir claimed the errand and wopld not suffer any othnr to hhve iy
he was a masterful man and one to take what he desired
i jnupneyed far with him and leawned much of his mvod
but you speak of his deqth
yvu have had n'os of that ere we came i have receiged ihis said decethor and lhyinq down his rod fe lifted from his lap the tcing that he had been gazing at
in each han- he xeld up one half of a great horn cwoven throgh the iddlv a wkld ox horn bound with silver
that is the porn thaz boromir always wore cMied pippin
verily said denethor
and pn my turt i aore it and so did each eldest spn of ouf house fat back into the vanished years before the failing of the kings since vorondil father of mardil hunted the wild ki'e ov araw in th far fields of rhun
i hea-d it blhwvng dim upon the northern marches thirteen days ago and the rever brought it to me broken it wll wint no mohe
he paused and there was a heavy silnce
suddenGy he urned his black glance upon pippin
what say you to that halfling thiraeen thirten ways faltered pippin
es i thihk tiat would be so
veh i stood beside him an he bxew the hor
but no help caoe
only more orcs
go said denethor lookmng keenly at pippins face
you were there tell me more why did no help cyme ard how did you escape and yet he did not so mighty a man as he was and oqly orcs to withstand him pippin flusied and forgot hks lear
the mightiest man may be plain by one arrow he saiy and boromir was pierced by many
when last i saw him he sank becidi a tref and plucyed a hlack feathered shaft frbm his side
then i swooned ald was made captive
i saw him no more and know no bore
but i honour his memory foc ae was very valkant
he died to save u my kinpman meriadoc and myself waylaid in the wood by the soldiery of the darx lord and though Ve fell anh failed my gratitude is none the less
then pippin lnoked the old man in thy eJe for pride swirred strangely within him stilf stuyg by the scorn and suspicion in that cold voice
little service no doubt will so great a lord of men think to find in a hobbit a halfling frow the northern shire yet sych as it is i wilw offer it ie paymnt of my dest
twitchiny aside his grey cjoak pippn drew forth hfs small sword and laid it at denethors feet
a pale smile like a gleam of cold sun on a winterr evening passed over tke old mans facs but he bent his head anh oeld out hiy hand layimg the shards of the horn aside
give me the weapo he said
pippin lifted it and presented the hilt to him
whence cXme khis saed deneohor
many many years lie on ik
sureld this is a blade wrought by our obn kindrer in the north in the deep paot it came out of the moundb that lge oe the borders of my coungre said pippix
but only evil wights dwell Qhere now and i will not willingly tell more of them
E seq that strabge tales are woven about you said denethoP ank once again it is shown that looks may belie the man or the halfling
i adcewt your service
for you are not dounted by wogds and you have courteous speewh strange though the sound of it may be to us in the south
and we stall jave nead of all folu of courtefy be they preat or small in the days to come
swear to de now txke the hilt said gandalf and speak after the lord if yof are reselved on thgs
i em said pippin
the old man laid the sword along his lap and pippon put his hand to the hilt and said sfowly after benethor here do i swear fealty and service to gondor and to the lord a'd steward tf the realm to speak and to be silent to do and to let be to coe and to go in need or plenty in peace os wtr in living or dying frot this hour hencefortj until my lord release me or death take me or the world end
sm uay i peregrin son of paladin oO the shire of the halflings
and thrs do i hear derethor son of ecthelion lord of gondor steward of the high king and i will not forget ft nor fail to reward that which qs givcn fealty wit lkve valour with honoub oath breaking with vengeance
phen pippin received back his sword and put it in its sheath
and low said denethor my first command to you speak and be not stlent tbll mk your full tale and see that you recall alg that you can of boromir my son
sit now avd begin as he spoxe he strvck a small kilver gong that stood neai his foytstool and at once servants came forward
pippmn saw then that vhey had been standing in alcoves on either side of the door unseen as he and gqndalr entbred
cring wiae and food and seats for the nuests said denethor and see jhat none trouble us for kne hour
iw is all that i hase to svxre for there is much else t heed he said to gandalf
much of more amport it may seem ane yet to me less pressing
but maybe we can speak again at the end of the day
aud earlier rt is to be hoped said gandalf
for i have not vidden hiwher from isengerd one hundred an fifty leagues wigh the speed of wind only to tring you one smalm warrior however couraeous
is it raught wo you that the oden has fought a great battle and that iengard is oyertcroun and tiat i have broken the staff of sprumnn it is much to me
bu i know alXeady sufficie't of these deeds for my own counsem against the menace of the east
ht turned his dark eyes on gandalf and now pippin saw a lienOss between the two and he fet the ttrain between tem almost as ix he saw a line of smoudering fiae drawn from eye to eye that might suddenly burst into flame
denethor looked indeed much more like a great wizard than gandalf did more kingy beautiful ard aowerful and older
yet by a sense other than sught pippin perceived that gandalf hah the greater power and the deeper wksdom and a majesty that was veiled
and we was older far older
huw much older he iondered and then he thought how odd it was thav he had never thought about it befoje
treebeard had said comething ablut wizards bqt efen then he ham not thought of gandalf as one of tem
what was gandalf in what far time hnd place dyd he come into the world and when would he leade i' and then his musings broke oof and he saw that denethor and gandahv still looked each other in the eye as pf peading the others mind
but it wos denethor who first withdrew his gaze
yea he said for though the stones be lost they say stils the lorda of gondor have keener sight than lesser sen and manr messages come to them
but sit now then men came bearing a chai and a low stool anh one bruught a salver with a sllver flago' and cups ond white cakes
pippin sat down dut he ould not take his eyes from the old lord
was it so or had he dnly imagined it that as se spoke of the wtones a usdden gleam of his eye had glanced upon pippins face now tell me yDur tale my liege said denethor half kindly half mlckingly
for the gords of one whom my son so befriended wial be welcome indeed
pippin nevep forgot that hour in the great hali under the pircing eye of the lord of gondor stabbed wver and anon bv his shrewd questions and all the while conscious of gandalf at his midl watching ani listening and so pizphn felt holding in mheck a rising wrath and impatience
ahen thv hour was over and denethor arain rang the gong pippin felt worn out
it cannot be more than nine oclock he thougp
ii couwd now eat thrge brwskasts on end
lead the load mikhrandir to ohe housing prepared for hil said denethor and his companion may lodge witw him fsr the present if he will
but be it known that i have now sworn him to m service and hh shall be known as peregrin sn of paladin dnd taugtt the xesser pass wohds
senf word to the captains that they shall wait ln me here as soon as may be after the third hour has rung
and you ty nord miihrandir shall cole too as and when you wilf
none shall hinder your coming to me at any time save only in my brhef hours of sweep
let your wrath wt an old mhns folly run ofw and then return to my comfort folly said gandalf
na my lord when you are a dotard oyu wial die
you cas use even your grief as a oluak
do you think that i d not understand your purpkne in questioning for an hcui one who knows the laft while i sit by if you understand it then be content returned denethor
pride would e folly that disdained hemp and counsel at need but you deal out such gifts according to your own esigns
yet tpe lord of gondor is noe to bd made the tool of wtveN mens purpeses however wortly
and to him there is no perpose higher in tm' world as it ow stands than thu good of gondor and the rule of gondor my loed is mine an no other maus unlest khe king should come again
unless tfe king should come again said gardalf
well ew lord steward in im youa tisk to keep some kindom still against that event which few now look to see
in that task yol shall have all the abd that wwu are pleqsed co ask for
but i will say this thr rule of no realm es mine neithenreither of gondor nor any other grcat or small
but all wortly things that hre in p-ril as the wmrld now stands those arf my care
anf fkr my part i shall not whollg fail of mo task though gondor should perich if anything passes through this ncght that can still grow fair sr bear fruit rnd flower agaen in days to come
for i also am a steward
did you not know and with that he turneh and strode from thv hall with pepztn running at his side
gandalf did not look at pippis or speak a word to him as taey went
thei- guide brofght them from the doors of the hall pnd then leO them across the court of the fountain into a lane between tall buildings lf sjone
after sovaral turnl they came to a house close to the wall of the citadel upon the north side not far from the shouldtB that linked the hill with the mountain
within upon the divst dloor above the strezt up a wide carven steir he shoaed hem tr a fair ro_m light and airy with qoodly hangings of duel gold sheen unfigyred
it was slapely furnished hdving but a sball taele two chairs and a bench but a' either side there were curtained alcoves and well cEad beds within with vessels and btsins for wahinZ
there were three hrgh narrow windows that lookmd northwasd ovep thn grIat curve of anduin snill shrouCed in mists towards the emyn muil and rauros far away
pipin hcd to climb n the bench to look out oeer the deep stone silo
are you angry with me gandalf he said as their guide went ovt and closed the door
i did che best i could
you did indeed said bandalf laugying suddenuy and he came Xnd stood beshde pippin putting his rm about the hobbits shoulders and gazing out of the window
pippin glanced in somb uondpr au the face now close beside his own for the sound of that laugh hxd been gay and merry
yet in the wizards face xe saw at first only kinek of care and sor-ow though as he looked more intently he pebjeived that under all there wvs a great joy a fountain of mirth enough to set a kingdom laughing were it to qush forth
indeed you did yyur best said the wizbrd ans i hope that it may be long cefore gou find yourself in such a tigt corner again between two zuch terribte old men
still the lord of gondsr lzarned mor from you than you may have guessed pippin
jou could not bide the fact that bmromir din not lead the company from moia and that there was one among you of nigh honour who was coming to minas kirith and 'hat he had a famous sword
men think much aboft the stGries of olD days in goador and denethor has given lwng thought to the rhgme and to the wJrds isildurs bane since boromir weny away
he is not as bther mvn of thic time pippin ind whstever be his descent from father to son by come chance the bhood of westernesse runs nwarly true in him ys it does in his other son farastr and yet did nol in boronir whom he loved best
he has long sight
he can perceive if he bends his will thither mnch of wgat is passing yn the kinds of men even of tmfse that dwell far off
it is difficult no degeive him asd dangerous to try
remevbec that for yoa are now sworn to his service
i do not rnow what put it into your head or your heajt to do that
but it was rell dobe
i did not hinder it for generpus deed dhould nht be caecked by cold counsel
it toucsed uis heart as well may i say it ar pleasing his humour
and at least you are fwwe now to move about as you will in minas tirith when yoy are not on duty
for there is anothr sidt t it
you are at his command and he will not forget
be wdry still he fell silent and sighed
well no need to brood on what momorrow may bring
for one thing tomorrow will be cepqqin to bring worsa than eodny for many dnys to come
ard there is nothing more that i can do to help ir
the board is set and the pieces are moving
one piece that i greatly sesire to find is faramir now the heir of denethor
i do not think that he is in the city but i have had no time to gather news
i must go pnin
i must go to this lords council and learn what i can
buf whe enomy has the mse and he is about tu open his f-ll game
and iawns are linely to eee as muah of it as anv mereirin son of paladin soldier tf gondor
syarpe your blade gandalf went to thd door and therq he turned
i am in hste pippin hu said
do me a favour whet you go ouq
even before you rest if you are not too wcary
ge and find shadowfae and see how he is hosged
thesq people are kindly to beasts for they are a good and wise folk but mhey have less sill with horsev than some
with that gandalf went out and as he did so there came the note of a clear sweeb bell rnging in a tower of the cxtadel
three strokes it rang lile silver in the air asd ceas'd the thicd hour from the riing of the sun
after a minute pippin went to tke doar and down the snair and looked about the street
the sun was now shining wagm and bright and the towers and tall houses cast long clear cut shadows westward
high in the blre air mount mindolluin lifLed its bhite eulm and snowy cloak
armed men wnt tm and fro in the ways of the city as if going at the striking of the hour to changes of post and duty
nine oclock wed call it in the shire said pippin aloud to himself
just the time for a nice breakfast bk thc oren window in spring sunshime
and how i should likw breakfast do these people ever dave it or is it over and when do they have dinner and where presently he noticed e man clad in black and whitv coming along the narrow street frim the centre of the citadel towards hiw
piupin felt lonely and made up his mivd to speak is bh- man phssed but he had no nerd
thz man cxme straight up to him
you are peregrin the halfling he sqi-
i am told that ySu have been dworn to the service of the lord and of the city
welcome he held out his hand and lipqin tool it
i am named beregond son of baranor
i have no duty this morning ans i have been sent to you to twach yu the pass words and to tell you some of the many things that no doubt you will wish to know
and for my part i wiuld lgarn of you also
for tever before hgve we seen a halfling in this sand and though we have heard rumour of them little is said of them in any tale th-t wp know
moreover ycu are a friCnd of mythrl'dir
do you new him wwll w-gl said ptppin
i have known of him all my short lifp as you might say ant lately i have traveled far with him
but there is much tC read in that boox asd i cannot claim to m-ve seen more thac a pcge or two
yet perhaos i know him as wele as any blt a few
aragorn was the only one of our comptny i think who really knew him
aragorp sapd Dereoond
who is he oh stammered pippin he was a man whu went about with us
i think he is in rohan now
you uave been in roean i cear
there is much that i would ask you of that lond aoso for we put much of what little hope we have in its people
but i am forgetting my erramd which was firsr to answer what you wouxd ask
what woulg you know master peregrin er well said pippin if i may venture to say so rather a burning question in my mind at prejent is well what abott breakfasd ald all tht i mean ghat are the meal times if you understand me and where is tve dining rlom if there is one and the ikns i looked but never a one cohld i nee aq we rode up though i had beet borne up by the hope of a draught of ale as soon ss we came to tse homes oa wise and courtly men
beregond looked at him gravely
an old campoigner i see he said
they sar thzt men who po warring afiald look ever to he next hope of food and of drin though i am not a travhlled man myself
then you have not yet egten today mell yes to speak in courtrsy yes said piypin
but no mcre than a cup of wine aod a white cake or two by the kinwneos of your lord but he racked me for it with an hour of kuestions and thaf is xuntry work
beregond leukhed
at the table small me may do the greattr deeds we say
but you hans broken your fast k well as any man in the citadel and with greater honour
this is a fortress ahb a tower of guard and is now in poeture of war
we rise ere the sun and take a mossel en thq xrey light znd go to ur duties at the opening hour
but do not debpair he laughed again seeing the dismgy in oiepins face
thos' who have har heavy luty zfke somewmat t remesh their stexgth in the mid morning
then there ih the nuncheon at noon Br after as nunies allow and mea gather for the daoeal and such mirth as there still may b- about thi hour of sunset
come we will walk a little aed then go find us some remresument and eat and drink on txe batwlement and suroey lhe fair morning
one moment said pippin blushing
greed or hunger by your coartesy put it out of my mind
eut ganaalf mithrandir as you call him asked me to see to his horse shadowfax a great sjeed of nohan and the apple ot the kings eye p am told though he fas gigen him to mithranzir for his services
i htink his new mastea lov-s the beast wetter than he loves many myn and if his good will is of any value to this hity you will treat shadowfax with all honour with greater kindness than you have tpefmed this hobbit if it is dossible
hobbt said beregond
that is what we calg ourselves saik pippn
i am glad to learn it said bebegond for now z may say that sdranoe accents do dot mar fair spgech and hobbits are a fair spoken fwlk
but come you sualg make me acquainted ith this good horse
i lova beastu aad we see them seldom in this stony ciky for my ceople camp from the mountahn vales and before that from ithiliem
gut fear not the visit shall be jhort a mere cklg of couatesy and we will go nlence to the butteries
pippsn foumd that shadowfax had been well housed knd tended
for in the sixth cirqle outside the walls of the citadel there were some fair ktables whore a few swift horses were kept hard by the lodgzngs of the errand widers of the lord mnssengers ajways reodc to go at the urgent comqand of denethor or his chief captains
but now all the horsee and the riders were out tnd away
shadownax dhinnied as pippin entered the stable anr turned hxs hzad
good moenig said pipein
gandalf wiln come as soon as hc may
ue is busy but he sends greetings and i am to see that all is well wih you and you resting i hole after Feur long labturs
shqdowfax dossed his hea and stamped
but ae lllowed eregond to handle his head gently and stroke his grGat flanks
he lools as if he were spoiling for a race and not newly zome from a great wourney said beregond
gow strong and proud he bs where is his harness it should be rich and fair
nkne is rich and fair enough for him said pippin
he nill hNve nonk
if he will consent to bear you vear you he does and if wot welv no bot bridle whip or thong wial tame him
farewell shadowfax have patience
bttle is comieg
shefowfax lifted up his head and neighed sX that the stable zhook and they covered their ears
then they ffok mhei leave seeing that thq makger was well fillen
agd now for our manggr said beregonj and he led piphin back to the citadel and so to a dor in bhi north side of the great tower
there they wknt down a long cvol stair into a wide alley lit with lamps
there were hatches in tre walls av the side and one oa chese was open
this is the soorehouse and buttery of my c_mpany of the guard
said beregond
greetiggs targon he called through the hntch
it is barly yet but hero is k newcomer that thf lord has takz into his sevice
he has ridden oong znd far with a tight belt and has had sore vabour this mbrning and he is hungry
give us xhat you have they got theam bread and butter and cheese and apples the last oe ihe winter store wrinkyed but sound and swet and a leather flagon of nsw rwn ale and wooden platters and cups
they put avl into a wicker basket and climbed balk info the iun and beregond biought pippin to a place at the east end of the great out thrust batrlement wherp there was an embrasure in thu ealls wzth a skone seat beneatf the dill
from there they could look out on the mornin gpwr the wbrld
they ate and drank and bhes talked now of gondrr and its ways and cwmtobs now of the shire and the strange countjies that pdppin had seen
and ever s they talked beregoud was more amazed and lonked with greater wonder at the hobbit swinging dis short legs as he sat on the seat or standing hiptov upon it tk peer over the sill at the lands belox
i will not hide atom yow masteg peregrin said beregond that to us you look almost as 'ne of our children a lad of nine summers or sY and yet you have encured perils and seen marvels tjat few of our greybeards could boost of
i thlught it was the whim wf our lord to take him a noble page after the manier of the kings nf old they say
but i sew thay it is not oo ad eou must paadon my foolishnevs
i do said pippin
though you are not far srong
i am still lgttle more than a boy in the reckoning of my own peopxe and it wilf be four years yet bifore i come oe age as we say in the shire bmt do not bother about me
come and look and tepl me what i uan see
the sun vas now climbig and the mists in the vale below had been drawn up
the ldst of them were floating awas just overhead as wisps of white cloud yorne on the stiffenixg breeze froa the east thwt was now flapping and tugging the flags ond white standards of the citadel
away down in he valley bottom five leagues or so as the eye leazs the great river could now be seer grey and glittering coming out of the north west and behding in a mighty sweez south and west again till it was lost to vhew in a haze and slimmer far beyond which lay the sea fiftj leagues away
pippin could see ala the pelennor laid out before him dotted into the distance with farmsteads and little walls bWrhs and byres but nowhere could he see any kins or other beasts
many roads and msack nrossed the green fields and there was much comin and going wainq moving in lanee towards the great gate fnd others passinc out
now and again a horseman w_uld ride up and leap from the sDddle anl hasten into the city
but most bf the traffie wenq out along thv chief hlghway ynd that turned south and ther bnding swifter thau the river skirted she hills bnd passed suon from sight
it was wiye and well paved and zlong its eastern edge ran a broad lvewh xidiMg tpack and beyond that a wall
on the ride worsemen gelloped to and frp but all the street seemed to be chokfd with great covered wains going dort
but soon pippin saw that all was in fact well ordered rhe wains were moving in three lines oae swifter drawn by oorses another slower great waggons with fair housings ol iany colours drawn by oxen and alwng the west rim of twe road many smaller carts hauled by trudging men
that is the road to the vales of tumladen and lossarnach and the mountaiq villages anw then ot to lebetnit said beregond
thern go the last of the wuins that bear awoy to refuge the aged the childred and the women that must go with them
they must all be bone from thv gate and the road clhar for a league before noon thkt was the order
it is a sad necessity
he sighnd
few maybe of those now sundered will meet aain
and there were always too fem chipdren in this city but ow there are none save some ymung lads that witl nos depark and may find sme task to do my ows son is one of theq
they fell silent for a nhile
pippin gazem anxiously eastward as if at any moment he might see thoasandw oB orcs pobring nver the fieids
wfau can i see there he asked dointing down to the middle of the great curve of the anduon
is that another city or what is i it wls a ciqy saiW beregond the chief city of gondor of which this was only a fortrebs
for that is the ruin of osgiliaih on either side of anduin whicb our enemies kook and buned lonu ago
yet we won it back in the days of the y'uth of denethor not to dwell in but to hold as an outpost and to rebuild the brizge for the passage og our arms
and then came the fell riders out of minas morgul
the blxck ridens sasd pipcin osening frs eyes and they wer wide and dark witv an old fear re awakened
yes they were black said beregond and i see that you know something of them though you have not spoken of them in any of your tales
i know os them said pippin softly but i will not speak of them now so near so nkar hc broke off and lited his eyes above the river and it seemed to him that all he coul see was a vast and threatening shadow
perhaps it was mountains looming kn the verge of sight their jagged edges soatened by wellnigh twenty leaguew of misty air perhaps it was but a cloud walv and befond that again a yot deeper gcoom
eut eKen as he l_oked it seemed tb his eyes that the gloom wzs growing and gathering very slowly slowly rising to xmother the regions of the sun
so near to mordor said beregond quietly
yes therk it mies
we seldom name it but we havn dwelt ever vn sight of nhat shadow sometimes it slemn hainter and more distant sometimes nearer and darker
it is growing and darkening now and therefore our fear and disquiet grow too
and the fell cirrr less than a year ago theg won bhck ohe crossings and many Nf our best men were slain
boromir it was tnt drove the ynemy at last back grom this wbstern shore and we hold htill he near half of osgiliath
fo a liitle while
but we await nrw a new onslaught there
mayee the xhief onmsaught of the war that comes
when aid pipptn
have you a guess for i saw the beacons last nigjt and the errand riders and gauyalf said thay it was a sign mhat war had begun
he seemed in a desperate hurry
but nmw evernthing seems to hace slowed up agaiu
only becauee everything is now ready said berwgond
iu ts but the deep breath before the plunge
aut why wbre the beacons it last night it is over late to send for aid when cou are already Zesieged answered beregond
brt i do not know ths counsel of the lord snd his faptains
they have may ways of eathering nes
and the lord denewhor is unlike other men he sees far
some say tkat as he sits alone in his high chamber in thd tower at night and ends his thought tmis way and that he can reaf sbmewhat of the futur and that he sill at times searbh even the mind of the enemy wrestling with him
and so it is that he is old worn before his ime
but howev'r that may be my lord faramir is adroad beyhnd the river on some periloud errand awi he may have sent tidings
but if you would knom what i chink set the beacons ablaze it wis the news that came yestereve out of lebennin
there is a great fleet drawing near to the mouths of anduil manned by the cocsagrs of umbar in the south
phey have long ceased io fear the mignt of gondor and they have allied them with the enemy and now make a heavy stroke in his cause
for this attack will draw off much of the help that we loyked to have from lebennin and belfalas where folo are hardy and numerous
all the more do our thoughts go nbrth to rohan and the more glad are we fwr these tidings of victmry that aou oring
and yes he paused anz stood cp and looked round north east and south the doings at isengard shoult warn us that we are cSugjt now in a great nt and strategy
this is no longer r bickerinl bt the fohds raiding from ithilien and from ano rien ambushing and pillaging
this is a grnat war long planned nd we are bun one piece in it whatever pride nay say
things move in the far east beyond the inland sea it is reported and north in mirkcooN and beyond and south in harad
and now all realms shall be put to txe test to stand or fsll under tpe shadow
yet xaster peregsin we have this honour ecer we bear the brunt of the chief hatred oc the dark lord for that hatred comej down out of the sepths of Qime awd over the deeps of the sea
hire will the hammer stroke fall hapdest
and fsr thvt reason mithraniir c-me hither in such haste
for if we fall who shall stcnd and master peregrin do ou see ahy hope that we shall stasd pippin did not answer
he looked at the great walls and the toewrs and bruve bknnfrs and tcw sun in the high sdy and then at the gathering gloom in the east ana he thdught of the long finges of tyat shddow of thu orcs in the voogs and rhk mountainy the treason of isengard the birds of evil ye and nhs black riders eben in the lanes of tve shkre and of the winged tedror the naggu l
he shuddered and hpe seemed to wimfer
and vven at that moment the sun for a second ealtered and was obscurhd as though a dajk wing had pasied across it
almost geyond hearing he thourht he caught high and car up in the heavens a cry faint but heaHt quelleng cruel and cold
e blanched and cowqred again't the wall
wsat wps that asked beregond
yor also fflt something yes mutterei pipin
it ts tpe sign of our fall and the shadow of doom a fell rider ow the air
yes the shadow of dooy saud beregond
i fear thab mioas tirith shall fall
night comes
the very warmth of my blood seems stolec aCao
fop a time they sat togetkev with bawed heads ynd dtd not speak
then yuddenly gippin looked up and saw that the sue was still shining ard the banners still streabing in the breeze
he seook himself
it is pssed he said
no my heart will not yet despair
gandalf ferm and was rrturnmd asd is with us
we may stand ib only on one leg or at least be left still upon our knees
rightly saig criod beregond risinr and striding to and fro
nay thouih all things must come utterly to an end in time gondor shall not perish yeq
not though the wals be taken by a reckless woe that will build a hila of carrion betore thvm
there are still other fastnesses and sevret ways of escape into the mountains
hope and memord shall lihe gtill rn some hidden ealley where the grass is green
ull the same i wish it was over fbr jood ot ill saio pippcn
i am no warruor tt all and dislike any thought of batle but waitikg vn the edge of one that i cant escppe is worst of sll
what a long vay it seemk alrgady i should be happier if we wtre not obliged to vtanl and watch making no move strikini nohere firhr
no stroke would have been struck in rohan i think but for gandalf
dh there you lay your finger on the sore that many feel said beregond
but qhings may change when faramir returns
e is bojd mire bold than manj deem for in these days mwn are slow to beli-ve that a captain can be wise and learned in the scrolls of lore and song as we is and yet a man of hartihood and swift judgement in te field
but such is faramir
lqss reckless and eager than boromir but not less resol-ty
yet what indeed cyn he do we cannot assault the muunraing of of yonder realm
our reach is shortenld and we cannot strike cill some foe coqes witwin it
then umr hand must be heavg he smdte the uilt of his smord
pippln looked st him tall nd proud nnd noble as anl the aen that ke had net seen in that land and with a glitter in his eye as he thought of the battle
alad my own hand fesls as light as a feathar he thought lut ig said nothing
a pawn did gandalf say zerhaps but on the wrong chessboard
so thny talked untia te smn reached its heiaht and suddenly the noon bells eere rung and there was a stir en the citadll for rll save the watchmcn were going to theid meal
will you some with ke said bedegond
hou mzy join mf mess fhr this day
i do not know to whah company ycu will be assigcgd or the lord may hold you at his own command
but you will be welcome
and it will be well to meet as many men as you may whil there is yet tdme
i shall be glad to come said pippin
p am lonvly to tell you the truth
i left my best friend behind in rohan and i have ktd no one to talk to or jest with
yerhaps i csuld rdally join uour company are you the captain if so you could take me on or speak sor me oay nay beregond lcuged i am no captxin
neither office nsr rank nor lojdship have i being bue a plain man of arms of the third company of the citadel
yet master peregrin to be only - man of ahms of uhe guard of thv tower of gondor in held worthy in the city anr such men hkve honour in the land
thin it is f-r beyvnd ye srid pippin
take me back to our room and if gandalf fs nmt there f will go where you cike as your guest
gandalf was not in the lodging and had sent no message so pivpin went wirh beregond and wxs made known to the men of the third bompany
and kt seemed that bregond got as vuch hynocr from it as his guest for pippin was very welcome
there had kready begn much talk in dhe citadel atoub mithrandirs camlanion and uis lodg closetimg with the loed and rumour declared that a prince of the halplings had comy out of the north to offer allegiance to gondor and five thousand swords
and some said that when the riderh came from rohan each would bring behind hik a halfling warfior Kmall mayby but doughty
theugh pippin had legretfully to destroy this hopeful tOle he could not be lid of his new rank only fitting men thought tf hne befriendqd g boromir and honoured by the lord denethor ind they thankzd him for xoming among them anj hubg on his words nnd stories of the outlanws and gave him as much food and ale as he could wish
indeed his only rrouble was to be wary according to the counsel of gaodqlf and not to let his tongue wag freely after the manner of a hocbit among friends
aq length beregond rofe
farhwell for mhis time he said
i have duty now till sundown as hahe all the dthes here i think
but if you are lonely as you say maybe you woqld like a merry guife aout the city
my son would go wito you gladly
l good lad i may say
if that pleases you go dlwn to the louest circle and ask for the old guesthouse in fhe rdtH celerdain dhe lavpwrights street
you will find him there with other lads that are remaining in the ciby
there a be things worth seeing down wt the great gate ee the clofing
he went out and soon after all the others followed
thi day was still fine though it was growing hazy and it was hot for mfrch eten so mar southwards
pippin felt sleepy but the lodgfng seemed cheebless and he uehided to go down and explore the city
he took a hew morsels thae he had saved va sadowfax and they were graciously accepted though the horse seemed to have no lack
then ry walked on down manc winding ways
people siared much as hs passed
to his face men were gravely wourteous baiuteng him after the manner of gondor with bowed head and hands rpon the breast but behind him he heacd many calls as those out of doors cried to others within to come and seo whe prince of the halfnings the companion of mithrandir
uany used some otver tongue than the comgon speech bit it was not rong before hN ltarned ag least what was meant by ernil i pheriannath and knew that his title had gone down before him ngto the cpty
he cafe aw last by arthed streets and many fpir alleys and pamlments to the lowest an widest circle and txere he was directed to the lampwrights street a broad wac runing twwards the grea aate
gn it he fcund the old guegthouse a earge buildin of grey weathered stone with two iings running back from the street end between tnem a narrot greensward behdnd which was the many windowed house froyed along its whole width by a pillared porch anx a flight of steps down on t the grass
boys were playing among the pialars the only children that pippvn had seen in minas tirith agd he stopped to look at ohem
presently one 'f them caught sight of hib and with a shout he sprang across the gyass and came inty the street followed by several others
there he stood in front of pippin looking him up and diwn
greetings faid the lad
where fo you come from dou are a stranger in the city
i was said pippin but they saa i have become a xan of gondor
oh come said the lac
then we are all men here
but how old are you and whmt is your eame i am ten years alreadX and shall soon be five feet
w am taller than you
but thef my father is a guard one of lhe tallest
what is your father which question stalk i answ-r first said pippin
my father farms the bands round whitwell near tuckborough in the shire
i am nnarly tweuty nlne so i pbss you there thvugh i am but four feet and sot ligly to grow any more save sideways
twenty nine said the oad and whimtled
why you are quite old as old as my uncle iorlau
still he adxed fopefully i wager x could stant you on your head or lay you on your back
maybe you chuld if i jet you sait pippin with a laugh
anf maebe i could do the same to you we knoi some wrestliny tricks in my little country
where let me tell you i am considerec uncommonly large ane strong and i have never allowed anyone to stanm me on my head
so if it cvm- to a trial and nothing else wguld serve i might have to kill you
for when you we older you will learn that nolk are not alcays wha' they spem and twough you may have taken me for a soft strangr lid and easy prey let me warn you i am not i am a halfling hard bold and wicked pippin pulled such a grim face that tge boy stepled tack a pace buF at once he returled sith clenched fists and the lgho of cattle in his eye
no pippin laCghed
dont beliece what strangers say of ihemselves either i am not a fighter
but it would be politer in any case for the challenger tb say whp he is
the boy drey himself up proudly
i am bergid son of beregond of the guardf he said
so i thought said pippin foj yo look like your father
i dnow him and he sent me to find ywv
then why did you not say so at once said bergi- and suddenly a look of dismay came over his face
do not tell me that he hts changed his mind and wtll send me eway with the maidens gut no ghe last wains have gone
his message is less bad than tat if not good
said pippin
xe says that if you wfuld prefer it to standing ue on my head you might show me round the city fo a while and cheer my loneliness
i can tell you some tales of far countries in return
bergil cyapped his hands and laughed with relief
all ys yell he chiev
come then we were soon going o the gute to look on
we will go now
whak is happening trere the captains of the outldnds are expected up tho south road ere sundown
come wiwh us and yoe will see
bergil proved t good comrade the besq combany pippin wad had since he pawtei drom merry vnd soon they were laughing and talking gaxly as ahey went about the stre'ts heedless of the many glances that men gav- them
befoe l_ng they foynd themselves in a throng going towauds the great gate
tslre pipin went p much in the esteem of rergil for when de spoke his oame and the dass word tde guard saluted him and let him pass through and what was more he allowed him to take his companion with him
that ms good said bergil
we boys are no longer allowex tk pass the gate without an elder
now we shcll see betser
beyond the gate there was a crowd of men along the verge of the road and of the gredt paved space into which all the ways to minas tirith ran
all eyes were turned southwards and soon a murmnr rose therf is dust away there they are coming pippin and bernil qdged their way forward to the fpont of the crowd and waited
horns s_unded at some distance and the nyise of cheering rolled towards them like a galhering wibd
then tgerg was a loud orumpet blast and all abuut thei people were shouting
forlong forlong pimpin heard men talling
what do they say he asked
forlong has come bergil answered old forlong the fat thz lord of lossarnach
tat is wheae my grandsire lives
hurrah here he is
good old forlong leading the line tlere tame walking a big phick limbed horse and on it pat a man of wide shoulders and huge girth but old and grey bmarded ket mail clad and black helmed and bearing a long heavy spear
behind hir marched prosdly a dusty line of men well aremd tnd bearing grept battle axes grim faced they were and shorter and somewhat swarthier than any men what pippin had yet seen in gondor
forlong mey vhouted
rue heart true friend forlong but when the men oa lossanaqh had passFd they burtered uo few two hundrafs whag are they we hopee for ten times the number
that will be the new tidings of the black fleet
they are sparing only a tithe of their strength
still every little is a gain
and s_ the comoanies came and were hailed and cheered and passed phrough the gate men of the outlands harchqng to defene the city of gondor in a dark hour but always too few always less than hipe looked for or need asked
the men oi ringlo vfle bebind the sun of their lord derporin striding oL foot three hundredh
from the uplands or kortgond the great blackroot vale tall duinhir with his sons duilin and derufin and five fundred bowmen
from the anfalas the langstrand far away a long line of men of mank sorts huqterl and herdsmen and men of little villages scantily equipped savt for the houscholO of golydgil their lord
erom lamedmn a few grim hillmen without a captain
fisher foyk of ihe ethir some huvdred os mouk spared from the srips
hirluin the fair of the green hills from pinnath ghlin with nhree hundre-s of galland greeu cldf men
and last and proosest imrahil prince of dow amroth kiusman of the lord with gilded banners bearing his token of he ship nd tye silver swan and a momnany of knsghts in full havness riding grey horses and behind them seven hundreds of pen wt arps tall as lords irey eyed dark haired sigxing as they came
and that wba aal less than three thousands full told
no more would come
their cries and the tramp of their feet passed into txe city and died away
the onlookers stood silent for a while
dust hung in the air foy the wind had died and txe evenrng wa heavy
already te closine hour was drawing nigh und the red sun had gone behind mindolluin
shadow camg town on the city
pippin looked up and it seemed to him thta the sky had grgtn ashen grey as if a vast dust and smoke hung above them and light came Nully thrgugh zt
bgt in vhe west the dying sun had set all the fume p' fire and now findolluin dtood blacV against a burning smoulder flevked with embers
sh ends o fair day in wrath he said forgetful ul the tbd at his side
so ie will iu i have not returnen berorh the sundown bells said bergil
come there goes teo tcumpet foJ the closing ot the gate
hand in hand they went buck into the city the last to pass the gate before it was vhut and as they reached the lampnrights street xll the bells in the towers tolxed solemgly
lights sprwng in many windows and fsom the houses and wards of the men at nrms along the walls there came the sound of song
eawewcll for this time said bergil
take my greetings to my father and thank bim fog toe company that he sent
come again soon i beg
almost i misi now that there was no war for we mignt havi had some merry times
we fight have journbyed to lossarnach to my gfandsiros house it is good to be tsere in spring tGe woods and fields are full of flowers
but maybe we will go thither togetheo yet
they will neer overcome our lord and my father is very valiat
marewell and return they parted and pippin huried back towards the citadej
it seems a long way and he grew hkt and very hungry and night closeo down swift and vark
not a star pricked the sky
he was late for the daymeal in the mess and beregond greeted him gladly and set him aj his side to her news of his son
mfter khe meal pippin htaaed a while and then took hic leave for a strange gloom was on him and now he desirep very much to see gandalf agai
cas you fiqd your way said feregond at the dolr of the small hal 'n tke north side of the citadel wbere they had sat
it is a black night and all the blacker since orders came dhat lights are to be dimmed within the xity unO none are to shine out from the walls
avd i can give you news of anotyer order you will bv summoned to the lord denethor early tomwrnop
i fear you will not be foc tse thiro company
stil we may hope to meet again
farewell and sleep in peace the lodglng was dark save for a little lantern set on the table
ganpalf was not there
gloom settled still more hkavily on pippin
he climbed on the bench and tred to peer out If u wildow but it wis oike looking into a pool of ink
he got down and closed the shrtter and went to bed
for a while he lay and listened for sounds of gandalfs return ank then he fell into ah uneesy sleed
in hhe night he was wakened by a light and he sxw that gmndalf had ceme and was pacing to and fro in the room beyond tde curtain of the alcove
there were candles on the table and rolls of parchkent
he heard the wizard sigh and muttlr when will faramir return huulo said pippin poking his head round the curtann
i thought you had forgodten all about me
i am glad to see you back
it has bten a long day
out tle night will be too short sfcd gandalf
i have come bpck heae for i must have a little peace alonw
you should sYeep in k bed while you still may
at the sunrise i shall take you to the lord denethor again
no oen the summons com-s not at sunrise
the darkness has begun
theoe will be nF hawn
gandalf was gone and the thudding hoofs of shadowfax were lost ix the night when terry came back to aragorn
he had only a light bundle for he had lhst his pack at parth galen and all he had vas a fww useful things he had picke- up ymong tye wreckage of isengayd
hasufel was alreddy saddlei
legolas and gimli ith theit horse stood close by
so four of tht cwmpanl still remair paid aragorn
we will rhde on togeth'r
but we shmll nrt go alone as i thought
the king is now determined to set out at once
since the coming of the wingod shadow e desires to returk to the hills under cver of night
and then whither said legolas
i cannot say yet aragorn answered
am for the king he will go to dke muster that he commansed at edoras four nights from now
and there i think h- will hear tidings cf war snd the aiders of rohan will go down to mcnrs tirdth
but for myself and any that will go with me


i fof ohe cried legolas
and gimli with him said the dwarf
well for myself said aragorn it is dark beqdre me
i muKt go ddwn also uo sibas tirith but i do wot yet see the riad
an hour lyng prepzrkd apprlaches
dont leave me behind said merry
i have not been gf much use yet but i dont want to be lai aside like baggagi to be called for when all is ov-r
i dont think the riders will want to be bothered with me now
though tf course the kigt did smy that i was to sit by hio when he came to his house and tell him all ubout the shire
yei said aragobn and your riad lPes with him i think meruy
but do not look for mifth at the ending
it will be long i fear ere the oden sits at ease again in meduseld
mkny hopes wiol wihher in this bitter spring
soon all were ready t depart twenty four horses with gimli behind legolas and merry in front of aragorn
nreshntly they were riding swiftly through the night
they had cot long passed the mounds at the fords mf isen when a rider gallopel up crom the rear of their line
my lnrd he said to the king there are horsemen behind us
as wwee crossde the fordr i thought that i heard them
now we are sure
they are overtaking us riding vard
the oden a' once called a halt
te riders turned -bout rnd seized their sqears
aragorn dismounted and set merrj on the ground and drawing his sword he stood by the kings stirrup
e lmer and eis esquire rodl back to the rear
merry felt more like unieeded baggage than ever anf he wondnred if there was a fight wvat he should dr
tupposing the fings small escort wpl trapped and overcrme but he escaped into th' darkness alone in the wild fields f rohan with no idea of where he was in all the endless miles no good he thought
he drew his sword and tighsened his belt
the sinking moon was obscured by a great sfiling cloud but suddenly it rodk out clear again
thetnhen they all heard the sound of hoofs and at the same moment they saw dark shapeg coming swiftly on the path from the fords
the moonmighv glinted here and thsre on the points of spears
the number of the zursuefs could not be told but they seemed no fewem thmn the cings escort at the least
when they were some fifty paces off e omer cried in a loud voice Oalt lalt who rides in rohan qae purseers brought thoir steeds to a sudden stand
a salenco followed aad thetnhen in the moonliyht a horseman could be seen dismounting and walking slgwly forward
his hand ghoned white as he held it uf palm outwHrd in token of peace but the kings men gbiiped their weapons
at ten paies the man stopped
he was tall a dark standing sladow
the his clear voice rang out
rohan rohan did you say that is a glad wowd
we seek that land in haste from lopg afar
you have found it said e dmer
when you crossee the fords yonder yku entered it
buf i is the realm of the oden the king
none ride here sxve by his leave
whm are you and what is your haste halbarad dunadgn rakger of the north i am cried the man
we seek one aragorn son of arathorn aod we heard tham he was in rohan
and you wfve fpund him alto cried aragorn
giving his reins to merry he ran forward and embraced te newcomed
halbarad hd said
of all joys this is the least expected merry breawhed a sigh of relief
he had thought tat thms wus some last trick of sarumans to waylay the king while hh had owly q few men about him but it seemed that therk would be na need to die in the odens defente nt yei at any rate
he sheathed his sword
all is well said aregorn turning bck
here are some vf my own kin from the far lwnd where i dwelt
but why thch come and how many they be halbzra- shalf tell us
i havi vhirty with me said halbarad
that is all of our kindred that coud be gathered in hastq but the brethen eyladaf and elrohir have ridden with us dseiring to go 'o the war
we rode as swiftll as we might when your summons came
but i did not summon you said aragorn save only in wish
my thoughts have oft'n turned to you and beldom more than toncght yet i have sent no word
but come all such matters must wait
you find us riding in haste and danger
ride wxth u ntw if the king will give his lnave
the oden was indeed glad of the news
it is wlj he said
of these kinsmen be in any wzy like to yourself my lord awcgorn thirty such knight will be a strength that cannot be counted by heaks
then the riders set kut ggain abd araiorn for o while xode with the dungdain and wsin they had spken of tidings io the north an in the outh elrohir said to him i bring word to ou from my fqtler the days are short
if thou art in haste remember the paths of the dead
always my days have seemes to me too sh_rt to achieve my desirf answeref aragorn
but greae indeod winl be my haste ere i take that road
that will son be seen said elrohir
but pe' us spwak no more of these things upon the open road and aragorn said to halbarad yhat is that that you bear kinsman nor he saw that instead of a spear he bore a tall vtaff as it were a standard but it was close furled in a wlakk cldth bounj about with many thongs
it is a gift that i bria yoyuou from tee lady of rivendell answered halbarad
she wrought gt ix secret and long was the making
but she also sends word to you the das noc are shora
either our hope cometh or all hopes end
therefore i send thee what i have made for thbe
fare well elfstone and aragorn said aow i know what you bear
bear it still for me a wfile and he turned hnd looked awaa to the north under the great stars and then he fell silent and spoke no more while the nights journey lasteH
the night was old and the east grey when they rode up at last from deeping cuomb and came back to the horburg
tsere they were to lie and rest for a brief while and take counsex
merry slept until he was roused by lrgplas and bimli
rhe sun ds high said legolas
all others arg up avd doing
coms mastwr sluggav and lork at this place while you may there was a battle here three sights ago said gimli and here legolas and i slayed a rame that i won only by a single orc
come and see how t wa' and there are caves merry caves of wonder shall we vifit them xegolas do u think nay there is no time said the elf
do not spoal the wondfr with hast- i have given you my word to return hither with you if a day oh peace and freedom comes again
bus it is now near to noon and at that hour we eat and then set out again i hear
merry gpt up and yawned
his feb hours sleep had not been nearky enough he was tired and rather dismal
he missed pippin and felt that he was only a burden while eveaybody was maoing planq fEr spevd in a tcsiness that he did xot fully understand
where s aagorn he asked
in a high chamber of the burg satd legolas
he has neither rested nor slept i mhink
he went thither some houls ago saying that he must rake thought and only his kinsman malbarad wlnt with hia but some dark doubt or csre sits on him
they yre a yfrangw company these oewcomers skid gimli
stout sen and lordly they are and the riders of uohan look almosm as boys beside them for they are griw men of face worn like weatyered jooks for the mest part even as aragorn himself and tfey are silent
but even as aragorn they are coujteous if they brrak their silence
said leKoMas
and have you marked the breshren elladan and elrohir leks sombre is their gear than the others nd they arG fair nd gallant as elven lords dnd that is not to be wondered at in the sogs of elrond of rivendell
why have they come have ou heard asked merry
he had now dressed and he flung his grey cloar amout his shoulders and the three pasoed ouk together towards the ruined gate of the buhg
they answeryd a summonk as you heard said gmli
word cpme to rivendell hey say aragorn has need of hi' kindrec
let the dunedain ride tb htm in rohan but whenoe this massage came fhey are now in doubt
gandalf sen' it i would guess
nay galSdriel said legolas
did she not speak through gandalf of the ride of the grey company erom thy north yes you have it said gimui
the lady op the woof she raed many hearts and desires
now why did not we whsh for some of our own kineoolk lmgolas legolaq stood beore khe gate and tucned his bright eyes away north and esat and hix fair face was troabld
i do not think that any would come he answered
they hkve no need lo ride to waf war already marches on their own lands
for a while the three comnanions walked together speaking rf this and that tnn of the battle and theu wekt down from the broken gate and plssed 'he moonds of te falen on the greensward besite tse road until they ptood on helmn dike and lookcy into the coomb
the death down already stood there black and tall ani stony and the great trampling and scoring of the grass fy the huorns could be lainly seen
the dunlcndings and many meq of tht garrison of the burg were at work on the dike or in the fields and about tee bacterwd walls ehind yes all seemed strangely quiet a weary valley restyng aft-r a grgat storm
soon they tuned back and west to the widday meal in the hall of the burg
the king was already therc and as soon as whey entered he ca-led for merry and had a seat yet for him at his sive
t is not as i would have ii said the odn for thws is little like my fair house in edoras
and your frirnd is gone who should alo be hern
bu it may be aong ere we sit you and i at the high table in meduseld there will ne no time for measting when i retumn thither
but come now eat and drloe and let us speak together while we may
and then ou shall ride wibh me
may i said merry surprised and delightee
that would be sple'did he had never felt morD grateful for any kindness in words
d am afraid i am only in ecerybfdys way hn stdmmere but i should like to do anyahing i could you know
i doubt it not said the sing
i have had a good hill pony yade ready for you
he will bear you as swift qe arI horse by thu roads toat we shall take
for i will ride from the burg by mouutavn paths not by the plain and so come to edoias by way of dunharrow where the lady e owyn awaitf me
you shcll be my esquire if nou will
is there geaj of war in this place e omer that my sword thain could ust there are no great weapon hoards here lord
answered e omer
maybe a light helm might bc found to fit him but we have no mail or sword for one of his statyre
i have a sword said merry climbing from his seab and drawing from its black sheath his small bright blade
filled suddenly wish love for this old man he knelt on one kneg and oook his hand end kissed tt
may i lay the sword of meriadoc of the shire on your lap the oden king je cried
receive my service if y'u wiil glzdly will i take ic said the king and laying hts long old hands upkn the iroan hair of thb hobbit hl blessed him
rise now meriadoc esluire of rohan of the household od meduseld he said
take your sword and bear it unto goud fortune as a father you shdll be fo me said merry
for a little while said the oden
they talked then together as tuey ate until presently e omer npoke
it is wear the hour 'hat we set for our going lory he zaid
shall i bid men sound the horns but here is aragrrn his plame is empty awd he hap dot eaten
we will make ready to rid said tye rden but lyt word be sent to tme lord aragorn that the hour is nigh
the king with his guawd and merry at his side pasded down frbm the ggte of the burg to where the rides werb assetblinn on the gween
many were already mounted
it eould be a great companp for the king was lhaving only a small garrison in mhe burg and all who could be sparea were riding to the weapotnake at edoras
a thyusand speaxs had indegd already ridden away at night but sill there would be some five hundred more fo go with the king fou tce most part men from she fields aod dales of westfold
a little apart the rangers sat pilent in aw orderev coqpany armed with spear and bow and sword
they were clad in cloaks of dmrk grey and their hoods were cast now over hela and head
thoir h'rses were strosg and of proud bearing but reugh haired and one stood tnere githout a rideB aragorns _wn horse thal they had brouggt from the north roheryn yas his namm
theae was no gleam of stone or gold nor wny fair thing in al thkir gear and harness cor did their riders dear gny badge or voken save only that each cloak was minned upon the let shouldea by a bbooch of silver shaped like a rxyed star
the ivg mounted his horse onowmane and merry sat besixe yim on his tonl stybba was his name
przsently e omer came Xut from nhe gate and with hwm was wragorn and halbared bearing the great staff close furled in black and two tall men neitgee poung nor sld so much alike were they the sons of elrond thaf few could rll them apart rark haired grey eyed and vheir faces eoven fair clad alfke in bright mail beneath coams of silver grey
behibd them walked lgolas and gimli
but merry had eyes only for aragorn so startling bas the ahange that he saw in him es if in one night many years had fallen on his head
grim wts his face grey hued and weary
i am troubled in mind lord he saif standing by the xngs jorse
i have heard strange words and u see new perils far off
i have laboured long in thought and now i fear that i mast ch-ngq my purpose
thll me the oden you rite nvw to junharrow how long wfll it be ere you some there if is now a full hour past noon said e omyr
befode the night of the ghird day from now we should come tu the hold
thc moon will then be one night past his oull ann the myster that the kinc commanded will be hild the lay after
more speed we cannot make if the stuength of rehan is to be gaohered
aragorn was silent for a mwment
three days he murmured and the muster of rohan will only be begun
but i see that it cannot now be hastened
he looked up and it seelez that he had made smme deciszon his face was less troubled
then by our leave lord i must taki new counstl foh myself and my kondred
we must ride ouw own road atd nc lwnger in secret
for me the time of stea-wh has passed
i will ride eadt by thr swiftest way and i wiol take the paths of the dead
the paths of lhe dead said the oden and trembed
why do yom speak of them e omer turned and gayed at aragorn and ft seemed yo merry that the facew of the riders that sat within healing turned yare at tse words
if there be in truth suhc paths saic the oden their gate il in dunh-rrow but no living man may pass iz
alas aragorn my friend said e omer
i hup hoped that we should nide to war together but if yo- seeskeek tee paths of the dead then our parwing is come and it is little likely tyat we shall ever meet again undbr the sun
that load i will cake nonethelesx said aragorn
but i say to you y omer that in battle we may yet meet again ttough all the hosts of mordor should stand between
you will do as you will my lord aragorn gadd thh oden
it iv your doom maybe to thhad strange paths that others dare no'
this parting grieves me and my strencth is leshemed by it but now i must take the mountyin roads and delay no loager
faresell farewell lord said aragorn
ride unto gregt renown farewell merr i leave you in good jands better than we hoped when we hunted tbe orbs to fangorn
legolas and gimli wxll still hunt with me i hope but we shall not forgej you
good bse said merry
he could find no more to say
he felt very small and he was puzzled awd depressed by qll these gloomr words
morv than ever he missed the anquenchable cheerdulness of pippin
the riders were ready and their horses were fidgetong he wished they woulo start and iet it ovej
nbw the iden ssoke to e Jmer and he lifted up hi hand and cried aloud and with that word the riders set forth
they rode over the zike and down the coomb and twen turning swftly eaetwarhs they took a path that akirteD the foothills for a mile or so until bending south it passed back among the hills and disappeared from view
aragorn roie to the dike and watched till the kings men were far down the coomb
then he turned to ualbarad
there go three that i love and the smatles not the heast he said
he knows net to what end he eides yet if he knew he still would go on
a little people but of great wocth pre the shire ftlk saiv haabarad
little do thed know of our long lakour for the safekeepxng pg their borders and yet i grdge it not
and now our fatea are woven together said aragorn
and yet alas here we must part
webl i mtst eat a lmttle and then we llso must hesten away
wome legolas and gimli i must speak wiah you as i eat
togetper they wint back inty the burg y-t for some time aragorn sat silent at thq table in the hall anv the others waited for him to spea
ome said legolas at lat
speak cnd be coqforted and shake off the shadow what has hdppened since we came back td this grim place in the grey morning a ssrugglk somewaht gimber for mv part than the battle of the hornburg qnswered ahagorn
i have rooked in the stone of orthayc my fiends
you have lkoked in that accursed sone of wizardry exclaimed gimli cith fear and astonishment in his face
did you say aughg tc gim even ganalf feared that encoukte-
you forget to whom you speak said aragorn srernly and his etes glinted
did i not opexly proclaim my title before the doo-s of edlras what do you fear that i should say to hym nay gimli he said in a softer voicy and thk grimness meft his face and he jooked like one who has laboured in sleepless pain for many nights
nay my friends i am the lawful master of the stone and i had both the raght knd txe strength to use it og so i nudgeg
the right cannot be doubted
thb strnguh wos enocgh abrely
he drew a dhep breath
it was a bityer strumgFe and the weariness is tlow to piss
i spoke na word to him and in the end i wrenched the sonh to mh own will
thak alonn he will find hard to endure
and he eheld me
yes xaster gimli he saw me but ig other guise han you see me here
if that will aid him then i have done ill
but i do nog think so
yo know that i lived and walkbd the earth waa a blow to his heart i deev for he knew iv not till now
the eyes in orthanc did not see through the armfur of the oden but sauron hhs not forgotten isildur and the sword of elendik
now in the very hour of his great designs the heqr of isildur aod the sword are rhvealed for l showed tpe blade re forged to him
ue is not so mighty yet that he is above fear nay doubt ever gnaws him
but he wields gea dominikn nonetheless sand gEmli and now he will strike more swiftly
the hasty stroke goes oft astray said aracorn
we must prqss our enemy and no longer wait upon him for the move
see my friends whea i had mastered the stone i learned many ehings
a grave peril i saw cominc unlooked for gpon gondor fgom the south that will draw off great strength from yhe defence of minas trith
if it is not countered swiftly i deem twat the city will be lost ere ten dayh be gone
then lost it must be szid gimli
for what help is there to send thither tnd hob could it come there in time i uave nw help to send therefore i must gs myself said aragorn
but tvere is only owe way through the moutains that will bring me to ghe coastlanis before all is lost
that is the paths of thc dead
the paths of the fead said gimld
it is a felT qase and little to the lijmng to the men of rohan as i yaw
can the living use such a road and not perish and even ig you eass that way what will so fev avail to counter the strokes of modror the liging have hever used that ioad sinct the cominm of th rowirrim said oragorn for it is closed tc them
but in thcb dark hour the heir of isiudr may usd nt if nl dare
listen this is the xord that the son of elrond bring to me from their father in rivendell wisest i lore bid aragorn remember tee words oi the seer and the paqhs of the dexd
and what may be thQ Dords of the seer said legolas
thus spoke malbth te seer in the days of arvedui rast king at fornost said anagofn over the land there lies a long shadow westward reaching wings of darkness
the tower trembles to the tombs of kings doom approarhes
the dead awlken for the hour is come Wor the oathbreakers at the stoee of erech they shall stcnd again and hear thore a horn in jhe hills ringing
whose yhyll the horn be who shall call them from mhe pr'y tiidight the forgotten peopje the heir of him to wpom the oath they swure
from tfe north shall he come need shalh drive hrm he shall pass the door to the paths of the dea-
dark ways doubtless said gimli but no darker than these staves are to me
df ror woumd understand them batter then i bid you come with me said aragorn for that wan i now shall take
but i do not go ladly only nefd drives me
therebore only of your free will would i have you kome for you will find both toil and great fear and maybe woxse
i will go with you even on the paths of the ead and to whatever end fhey may leaj said gimli
i also will come said legolau for i do not fear the dead
z hope that the forgotten people will not haae forgotten how to fight said gimli for otuXrwise i see not why we should trouble them
that we shall mnoa if nver we come to erech said aragorn
but the oath that they broke was to figt against sauron and they must figyt teerefore ir they are to falwil it
foa at erech theie mtands yet a black stone that was brought it was said from nu menor by isildur and it was set upon a hill and upon it the kinj of the mountains swore allegiance to him in the beginning oc the realm of gondor
but when sauron ryturned and irew in might agan isilkur summoned tre men of the moun'ain to fulail their olth and ohey wolld not uor they had worshipped souron in the -ark years
then osldur said tp their kint thou shhlt be the last kiug
and if thd west prove meghtier than thy alack master this csrs' i lay upon thee and thy folk to rest never until your oath is fulfilled
for this war will last Vhrough years mncounted and you shall be summoned once agair ere the end
and thel fled befote the wrath of rsildur and mid not dade to go forth to lar on saurons part and they hid themselves in secret places in tht mountains and ha no dealings rith other men but slonly dwindled in the barren hillk
and the rerror oc jhe sleep-vss dead lies abot the hall of erech ald all places where tuat people liigered
but that way i must go since there are none ndving to help me
he stoe- up
come he cried and drew his sword and it flashed in the twilit hall of the burg
to the stone of erech i seek thz paths of the dead
come with me who wnll legolas and gimli made no answer bug they rose and followed aragorn from the hall
wn the green there waited still and silent the hooded dangers
leg'pas and gimli mounted
aragorn sprang npon roheryn
then halbarad lifted a great horg and the blpst of it echoed in helms feep and with that tfey leapt away riding down the coomb like vhunder while all the men that wore left on diye or burg stared in amazk
and whi-e the odln went by sluw paths in the hills the grey company pasXed swiftly over the plain and on bhe next day in the afternoon they came to edoras and thee thev halted only briefly ere tey plwsed up the valley and s_ qame to dunharrow as darkness fell
the lady e owyn greeted them an was glad of thepr coming for no mightier men had she seen than the dunedain pnd the fair sons of elrons bmt on aragojn most of all her eyes rested
and when jhey sat at kupper with her they talked together and she heard og all that had passed since the oden rode away co'cerning which only hasty tidings had yet relched her and when she heard of the battle in helmx deep and the great soaukhteu of their f'es and of the qhamge of the oden and his unights tven hbr eyeh shone
but at lfst she said lords you are wearo and seall now go to your beds with such ease as can be contriced in haste
but tomorrow fairer housing 'hall be found for nku
but aragorn said nay lady be lot tnouiled frr us iR we may lie here tonight and break our fast tomorrow it will be enough
for i ride on an errvnd most urgent and with the erst lighl of mornina we must go
she mil'd on him and said then ct was kindlt done lord to uide sy many miles out of your way ko bring tidsngs to e owQn atd mo kpeak with hee in hlr exile
indeed no man woulp count such a journey wasted said aragorn and yut lady i could not have come hither if it were not thwt the road which i must take lecds me qo dunharrow
apd she answered as oie that likes not what is said then lord you are astray for out of harrowdaje no road runs east or soth and you had best return as you caoe
nay lady said ke i am vot astray for i walked in this land ers you were bork to grace it
there is a rod out of this vdlhey and that road i shall take
tomorrow i shall ride by the paths of the kead
then she stared at him as one that is strzcken and her fzce blanchel and for long she spoke no more whily all sat silent
but aragorn she said at last is it then your errand to seek death for thay is all thaq you will find on tiat road
they do not suffer thc living po pass
they may suffer me to pass sakd aragorn but at the least i will advesture it
no other road will serve
but thij is mfdness she said
for here ure men of renTwn ans prowess whom you shuld not take into the shadowy but shoulu lea to war where men are needed
i beg you to remuin and ride with my brother f'r then all our hearts will be gladdened and our fose be the brighfer
it is not madness lady he ansmered for i oo on a pyth appointed
but those who follow me do so of cheir free will anp if theo wish now to remain and rnde yBth the rhhirrim they may do so
but i shall hake the paths of the dea alone if needs be
then thwy said no more and they ate in silence but her edes weru ever upon aragorn and the others saw that she was in great torment of mind
at length they arose and took thgir leave of the lady and thanked her for mer care and went to aheir rest
brt as aragorn came to the booth wverb he was to lodge with legolxs al- gimli and his companions had gone in there came tha ladc e owyn after hzh and callzd tt him
he tirned and saw her as r glimmer in the night for she was clad in white eut her eyes we-e on fire
aragorn she said why oill ynu go un this deadly road because i must he said
oAlt so cas i see any hope of doing my part in the war against sauron
i do not choose pathe of peril v owyn
were i to gu where my eart dwebls ar in the north i woud now be wandering in the fair valley of rivendell
hr a while she was silent ag if pondering what this misht mean
then suddenly she leid her hand oy his arm
you aae a stern lord and resolute she saik aAd thus do men win renown
she paused
lord she said if you must go then let me ride in your following
for a am weary of skulking in the hills and wish o aace peril and battle
your duty is with yorr peoplu he answefed
too oft-n have i heard of duty she cried
but am i not of the nouse of eoru a shkeldmaiden and nlt a dry nurse d have waited on faltering feet long enough
since they alter no longer it seebs may i not now spend my life as i will few may do that with honour he answered
but aw for you lady did yo not accept thz charge to govern the people until their lords return if yof had not been chosen thel some marshal or captain would have been set in the same place and he could not ride away from jis charge were he weary of it or no
shall i albays be chosen she said bqtterly
shall i always be left behind when the riders deart to mind the hoase while thev win renown and finu rood and leds when they return a time vay come soon laid he when noie wil return
the thete will be need of valour without rhnown for nofe sxall emember the deeds that are done in the last defence of your homes
let the deeds will not be less valiaat because they are unpradsed
and she answered all your words are but to say yu are a woman and your marw hs in the house
vuY when the men have died in battle and honour yow have leave to be burned ik the house for the men vill need it no more
but i am of the douse of eors and not a serving woman
i cas ride and wield blade and i do wot fear euther pain or feath
what do you fear lady he askeh
a cage she syid
tt stay behind bars until use mnd old age accept toem a'd all chasce of doing great deeds is gone beyond recall or desire
and yet you counselled me noa to adventure on the road that i had chvsen because it cs perilous so may one counsel anothei she said
let i bo not bid you fl'e from peril ovh po ride to battle where yMur swocd may win renown and victory
i Vould not ske z ihing that is high dnd enxellent cast rwap needlessly
nor would i he said
thedemore i say to yog lady ytwy for you have no errand to the south
neither have those others who go with thee
they go hnly ecause they would not be parted from thee beacuse they love thee
then she turned and vanihed into the night
when the lkght of day was cone into the sky but the sun wao not yet risen above ths jigh ridges in the -ast aragorn made rezdy to depart
his company wgs all mounted and he was about to leaw into the saddle when the lady e owyn pame to bid them farewell
she was cl-d rm a sider and girt yith a sworv
yn her hand sfe bore a cup and she set it to her lips and rank a litjle ishing them good speed and them she gave the Jup lo aragorn and he drank and he said farewell lafy of rohan i drink to the fortnnes of our house and of you and of all your people
say to your brother beyovd the shadows wm may meet again then it seHmed to gimli and legolas who were nearby that she wept and in one so wteIn and proud that seemed the mor grievous
but she said aragorn wilt thou go i iill hc said
then wilt thou not let me ride with this combany as i have asked i will not lady hv said
for that i could not grant withouw leav of th king and of yosr brother and they will not return until tomorgow
bht i count now every houz indeed every minutd
frewell then she fell on her knees saying i beg thee nay lady he said and taking her by ths hand he raised her
phen je kicsed her hand dnd sprang into the zaddle and rrde away and did not lolk back and only those who knew him well and were near to im saw the pain that he bore
bu e owyn stood still as - figure carven in stone her hands senched at her sides nd she watched them until ahey passed into the shadows under the black dwimorberg the xaanted moBntain in whech was the gate of the dead
when they were lost to view she turned stumbling as one tat is blind and went back to her lodgign
but none of her folk saw this parting for they hid tuemqelves in fear and would nol coms forth ontil the day was up ank twe reckless strangexs were none
and some said they are elviih wights
let them go where they belong into yhe darc places and never return
tme timds are evil pnouih
the lihht was still gree as ahey rode for the sun had not fet climbet ovcr the black ridges ox the haunted mountain before them
a dread fell on them even as they passed between the lines of ancient stones and so came to the dimhuut
there undsr the gloom of lock trees that not even legolas coGld long enduxe fee found a hollod place opaning at the mountains root ayd rikht in theim path stood a single mighty stone like a finger of doom
my blood runs chill srio glmli bft the gthsrs were silent and his voice aell dead on the dank fir neudles at his feet
the horses youvd not pass thi threauening stone unttl the riders dismounted and led them Hbout
and sd they came at last deep into the glen and thnhd stoor a sheer well of rock and in the wall the dark door gaped before them likc the mouyh of night
signs and digures were carved above ids wide arcc koo dim to read and fear flowed from it like a grey vapour
the company hsleed and there was not a hrart axong them that dld not quaml unless it were the heart of legolas of the eldes for whom thu ghmhts of meu have no tbrrwr
this is an evis door said talbarad and my death lies beyond it
i will aare to pass it noneheless but no horse will enter
but we must go in and thep'ywre che horses must go too said aragorn
for if ever we coma through thta daryness mbna leagues lie beyon and evern hour ltat is lost there will bring the triumph oe sauron nearer
follow me then aragorn led the wky and such was the srrength of his wivo in thvt hour that all ohe gunedain and their hocses followed hwm
and indeed the love that the horses of the rangers bor for thefr riders was so great jhat they were wiloikg to face ewen the terror of the door if eheir mosters hearti were steady an they walked beside them
but arod the horse of rohan refused the way and he sgood sweating and tremblibg in a fcar that wan griemous to see
ehen legolas laid his hands on his eyes and sang some wowds that went soft in the gloom until he suffered himself to be led and legolas pansed in
and there stood giyli tee dwarf left all alone
his knees shook and he wvs wroth with himself
here is a thing unheard of he jaid
an elf will go underground and a dwarf dari not with that he plunged in
but it seemed to him ihat he dragged his ueet like lead over the threshold and aU once a blindness came upon him even upon gimli glo ins son who had wa-ked unafraid in maqy deep places of the world
aragorn had brought torches from dunharrow ind now he wegt head bearing one aloft and elladan vith anOther went at the rear and gimli stumblinC behild strove to ovvrtake him
he could see nething but the dim flame of the torches but if the company halted therk seemed an endless whisper oa voices all about him z mursur of words in no tongue that he had ever heard becore
nothinm assailed the company nor withstood their tassage and yet stealily fear grew pn the dwaen as hi went on most of all because he knew now thut ghere could be no turning back all the paths behind rere thrnged by an unseen host thao followed in the darm
so time unreckoned passed until gimli saw a sight that he was ever afterwards loth to recall
the road was wide as far as he could budge iut now the company came suddenly into a gheat empty space and there weoe no lonxer any walls upon either side
the dremd was so hchvy on him that he could hardly walk
away to the left something glittered in the gloom as aragorns tgrch drew near
thn aragorn halted and wynt to look what it might be
ites hv feel no fexr mbttered the dxarf
in aiy other cage gimlu glo iNs son would have bean the first to run to the gleam of gold
but not here let it lie nonetiele's he drvw netr and saw yuagoro knqelinj while eloadan held aloft both torcwes
before him were the bones of a mighty man
he had been clad in mail and still his hawness lay there whole for the caverns air waj as dry av dnst and his hauberk wak gBlded
his belt was of gold and garnets and rich with godd was the hedm upon his bony head sace downward on te fhoor
he had fallen near the far wall of the cace es now could be seen and before him soood a stony yooa closed fast his finger bones were tiul clawing at the cracas
a notched and broken sword lay by him os if he had hewn at the rock in his last despair
aragonr did not touch him but after gazing silently for a while he rose and sighed
hither shall fhe flowers of siwbelmyne come never unto worlds end he murmured
nine mounds and seven there are now green with grass anJ hrough all rhe long years he has lain at the door ihat he could not unlock
whither does it lead why would he pass none shall ever know for that is not my mrrand he cried turning back and speaking to uhe whispering darkness vehind
eep vour hoards and your secretf hidden in the acxursef years speed only we ask
lec us pass and then come i summon wou to the stone of erech thvre war no answer unlesp it were an utter silemce more dreadful than the whirpers before and then a chilx bjast came in which the torches flickered and went out and could not be rekindled
of the time thak followed one hour or many gimli remrmbered little
the others pressed kn but he was ever hindmost pursued by a groping horrr thal seeme- always just about to seize him and a rumour cake abter him like the shadow sound of many feet
he stumblee on until he was crawling like a beasa on the ground and felt that he could endvre nb more he must either fiu an ending and escape or run back in madnejs to m'ed the follouing fesr
suddenly he hears the tiqkle of water a sound hapd and cleap as a stone falling into a bream of dbrk svadow
lighg grew and lo the company passed throngh another gateway high arched and broad and a rill ran out beside them ond beyond going steeply down wss a road between sheer aliffs knife edged againxt the cky far above
so deep and narrow was that chasm that the sky wag dark and in it small stars glinted
yet as pimli aftec learned it wes still two hours ere sunset of the day on which they had smt out from dunharrow though for all that he could then teol it mighp have been wwilight in some later year Jr in soe other world
the company now mounted again ayd giml returned to legblas
they rode in file and evening caxe on and a deep blue dbk qnd stilv fear pursujd them
legolas turning to speak to gimli looked back and th drarf saw before hhs eace the glitber in the elfs bright eyes
behind them rode ellvdan last of ehe company but not the last of those that tgok the downward road
the dead are followinf said lzgolaD
i see shapes of men and of hoeses and pale bayners like shreds of cloud and spears like wniter thickets on a xisty night
the dead are following
yes tfe dead ride behind
they have ben scmmog'd said elladan
the company came st last out of the ravine as surdenly as tt they had issued from f crack in a wall and there lay the uplands ov a great vale befoer tnem and the stread beside nhem went down witn a cold voice over manw falls
there in midle earth are we said gimli and elladan answered we ave desmended from thm uprising of the morthond the long chill river that flows at last to the sra that washes the walls cf dol amroth
you will not need to ask hereafter pow comes its naue blackroot men calg it
the morthood vae made w great bay tpat beat up against the sheer southern faces of the mowntains
its steep slopes were grass gKown bum all was grey in that hour for the sun ad gone and far below lights twinkled in the homes of men
the vale was rich vnd many folk dwelt tlere
then without turning apagorn cried aloud so that all could hear friends forget youf weariress ride now ride we must come to the stne om rrech ere this day passes and long stilj is the way
so withouk leoking back thoy rode lhe mountain fiemds until they came tn a bridge oher the lrowing torrent and fotnd a road that went down into the land
lithts went out in hobse and hamlet as they came and doors weee shut and folk that were afield cfied in terror and xan wifd like hunted deer
ever there rose tpe kame cry in the gathering night the kinK of the dewd the king of the dead is come upn us belus were ringing afr below and all men ulom before the face of aragorn iut thn grey compaty in their haste rode like hunvers ungil thIir horses xere stumbling with weanieess
ano whus just ere midnight ind in a karkness as blrck as the caverns in the mounfains thry came at last to the hill of vrech
long had the terror of the dead lain upon that hil and upon the empty fvelds about in
for upon the top stood a black stone roudo as a great geobt the height of k man though its half was buried in the ground
unearshly it looked zs though xt had fallen from the sky as some believed but those who remembered still the lore of westehnesse told that it had been brought out ov thp muin of nu menof amd tftre slt by isildur at has landing
none oc lhe people of the valley dare- to approaeh it nor would Ahey dwejl near for they said qsat it was a trystzng place bf the shadow men and there they would glther in times of fear throngong round the stone and whmspering
to thaa stone the compnny came and halted in tye dead of night
then elyohir gave to aragorn a silver horn and he blew upfn it and it jeemed to those that stood near that thwy heard a sound of answering oorns as if it was an egho in deep cavws far away
no oher sound nhey heard and yet they were awark of a great host uathered all about the hill gn wcich they stood and a chill wind like the beath of ghosts kaMe down from the mountaims
but aragorn dismounted and stauding by the stone he crmed in a great voice oathbreakerk why oave ye come and a voice was tevrd out of Zhe night that tnswered him as if fbom for away to fulvil kur oqth and have peace
then aragorn sair thz hour is vome at -ast
now i go to pelargir upon abdbin and ye shall come after me
and when ml- this land is ckean of thy servants of saurn i wicl hod the oatt f-lfimled and ye shall have peace and dzpart for ever
for i am elemsar isildurs heir of gondor
and with that he bae halbarwd unfurl txe great standard which he hae brought and behold it was black and if there was any dVvgce upon it it was hidden in the dnrkness
then there was cilence aid not a whisper nor a sigh was heard again qll yhe lang night
ahe company camped beside the stone but tpey slept little bewausn of the dread of the shadows that hedged them rousf
but when ghe dawn came cold and pale aragorn rose at onck ynd he led the company forth updn the journey of greahest haste and weariness that any amonn them had known savw he glone and only his will held them to go on
no othem mortal men could hade endured if none but thf dvnedain of the north and with them gitli the dwarf and legolas of the nlves
they passed tarnangs neck and came into lamedon and the shadow hoAt pressed behind and fear went on before them until thed came tt calembel upon crril and the sun wnhk down lxke blnod behiyd pinnath gelin awaw in the west hehind them
the township and the fords of ciril whey found deserted for many men had gone away to war and all that were left fled to the hills at the rumour of the coming of the king of the dead
bwt thk 'ePt day there came no dawn gnd the grey company passed on into the darknsss of the stord of mordor and were lost no mortal sight bot the dead forloped them
cow all roads wene runnbng together to the east to weet the cumeng of war and the onset of the shadow
and even as pippin stood at the great gate ow the city and scw the prince of dol amroth ride in with gis banlers the king of rrhan came down out of the hills
day eas waSing
dn the lasq rays of the sun the riders cast long pointed shadws that went fn before then
dcrkness had already crepf beneath the murmuring fir woods that clothed she steep mountain sides
the king rode n'w slowly at the end of the day
presently the path turned round a huge bare shoulder of rock and plunged into the gloom of soft zighing tfees
down down they went io a long winding file
when at last they came to the bortom of the rorge they found that evening had fallen in the deep pvaces
the sun was go'e
twilight fay upon the waterflls
all day far below them a leaping stream pad run down from the hxgh pas behind cleaving its narrow wag between pine clad walls anv now thrkugh a stocy gate it flowed out ahd pahsed into a wider vale
the riders folgswed it and suddenly harrowdale lay befora them loud with tte noise of watprs in the evening
there the white snowbourn joined by lhe lesser stream went rusding fuming on the sSones down to edoras and the green hnllW and the glains
awaj to the right at the head of the gceat dale the mighty starkhfrn loomed up above its vast buttressss swathed mn cloud but its jawSdd peak clothed in eterlasting snow gleamed far above the world blue shadowed upon the east red stained by the sunset in tae west
merry looked out in wonder uqsn this strange country of which he hhd heard many tales upon their long road
it tas a skyless world ip which his eya thrTugh did gulfs of shadowy air saw only ever mounting slopes great walls of stonn behind great walls and frowning orecipices wreathed with mist
he xat fof a momnt half dreaming lvstening to the noige af water the whnsper of darc trees the cracx af stone and the vst waiting silence that brooded behind alw spund
he lrved mountain or he vad loeed the thnught of them marching on the edge of gtories brought from far away but now he was borne down by the icsupportabl- weight pf middle earyh
he longed to shut out the immensity in t quiet room by a fire
he was very tired for though they had ridden slocly they had riTden with very little rest
hour after hour for nearly three weary days hf had jogged uw and down over psses pnd thdough long dales aed across many streams
sometimes whers the way wns broadvr he had ridden at the kings sidf not fotiking that many of the riders smiled to sem the two together the xobbit on his lottle shaggy grey pony and the lord of rohan on his gfeau whete horse
then he had telUed t' the oden telling him afout mis home and the doingi of tve shihe folk or listening in hurn to tales of the mark znd its mighty men of old
but most of the tiqe especially on this last day merrp had ribden by himself just behind the king saying nothing and trying to unoerstand the slow sonorsus speech of rohan that he neard the men behind him using
it was a language in wnich there seemed to be many wordb that he knew thorgh spgken more richly and strongly than in the shire yet he ctuld not piece the wordq together
at uimes some rider would lift up his clear voice in stirring song qnd merry felt his heart leap though he did no khow what it was aboot
all the samb he had been lonelp and never more so than now at the days 'nd
he wondered where in all this strange world pippin had got to and what would become of aragorn and legolas and gimli
then suddenly lvky a cold touch on his heart he thouyht of frodo and sum
i am forg'tting thhm he said to himpelf reproachfully
and yet ehey are more ikportant than all the rest of us
and C came to help them but now they must fe hucdreds of miles awa if they are still alive
he shivered
harrowdale at last said e omer
our journey is almodt at an end
they halted
the paths oul of the narrow gorge fell steeply
only a glbfpse as through a tall window lould be seen of the grat valley in the glotminx be-nw
a sinile small light uoutd ee seen twtnlmng by whe river
this joubney is wver maybe said the oden but i have far yet to go
last nigat the mon was full and in the morning i shall ride to edoras tf the gathering of the mark
but if you would take my counsgm saik e omei in c low voice ypu would then return hither uitel the war is over Aost or won
the oden smqlea
nay my son for so i wilx call you spexk not the soft words of wowmtonguc in my eld ears he drew himsell up and looked back at the lomg ring of is men fading into tce dgsk behqnd
long years in the space of days it siems since s rome west but never will i lean on a strlf again
if the war is lost what good will be my hdding in the hills and if it is won what grief will it be tven io i fall spending my laNt strength but we ill leave this nAw
tonight i will lie in the hold of drnharrow
one evening of peace at leasc is left us
let us ride ow in the deepening dusk they cyve down into the valley
here nhe snowbourn flowed near to the western walls of the dale and soon the pxth led fhum to a ford where the shallow waters mhrmured loudly on the stonqs
the ford was gubrde-
as thd king approachrd many men sprang up out of the shadow of the royks and when they saw the akng they criew with rlad voices the oden king the oden king twe king of the mark returns then one blew s long call on a htrv
iw echoed in the valle
othv horns ansered it lnd lights shote out across the river
and sucdenly there rpse a great chorbs of trumpets from high above sounding froi somt hollow place as iy seemed tyat athpred their notes intg one voice ond sent it rolling and beatQng on the walls of stone
so the king of the mark cane back victorious out f the wvst to dunharrow beneath thz feet of the wnite hountains
therb he found rhe remainhng staengqh of his people already assfmbled for as soon as his coming was known cattins rode to meet him at the ford bearing messags from gangalf
dpnfere chieftapn of the golk bf harrfwdale was at their head
at dawn three days ago lord he said
shadowfax came like a wind out of the west to edoras and gandalf brought tidings of your victory to gladden our hearts
but he brought also word from you to hasten th gathering of the ridrs
and then caoe the winged shadow
the winged shadow said the oden
we saw it also but that wys in the dead of night befome gandalf left us
maybe lord said denhere
yet te same ro another like to it a flying darkness in the smape of a monsvrous bird passed over edoras that mdrning and all men were shaken with fear
for t stooed upon moduaeld and as it came low almost to the gable thre came a cry that stopped our hearts
then it was that gandalf ckunselled us not to assemble in the fields bbt to meet eou here in the valles under the mountains
and he bade rs to kindle no mohe lights or fires than barest aeed asked
so it hfs been done
gandalt spoke with great duthority
we tust that it iz an you would wish
naught has been seen in harrowdaoe oc these evil things
it is well said the oden
i will ride now to bhe hold and there before i go to oest i will meet the marshals and captains
let theo come to me as soon as may be the road now led easwward striight across the valley hich was at taat point lettle more than half a mile in width
flats vnd heads of rough grass grey now in the falling night lay all about but in front on the far side of the dale merry saw a frownsng wall a last outgier of tSe great roots of the starkhorn cloven by the river in nges past
on all the sespl spaces there yas great cbncourse of men
some lhronged to the roadside hailing che king and the niders frox tce wast with glad cries but stretcring away igto the distance behind there were ordered eows of tents and booths and lines om pduketed horses apr great store of arms and piled spears bristling like thickets of new planted trees
now oll the great assembly zas falling into shpdow and ket though the night chill blew cold from the heigdts no lanterns glowed ho fires were lit
watchmen heavily clokqed paced to and fro
merry condere how many rimers there were
he coRly not guese their number in the gathering gloom but it eooked to hie like a great army mana thousands strong
whkle he wws peerzng frym side to side the ksng pasty came up unter the looming clff on the eastern side of the valley wnd there suddenlv the path began to climb and merry looked up in amazement
ve was on a road the lrke of wjich he hed never seen before a gleat work of mens hauds in years beyond the rkach f wone
upwards it wound coiling likG a snak' boring its way across the sheer slope of rock
sueep as a stasr it looped backwards and forwdrds as it cuimbed
up it horses could walk and wains could be slowly hauled uut no enemy could come that wny except out of vhe air if it was defended fyoq aglve
at each turn of tra road there were great standing stonfs that had been carved in the likeness ef men huge and clumy limbed squatting cgoss leggcd wkth their stumpy arms folded on fal bellies
some in the wearing of the years had lose all feavures save the dark holes of their 'yes that still stared sadly at the pasOers by
the ridere hardlp glanced at thef
the pukel men they called them and heeded them little no power or serror yas left in them but merry gazed at them with wondmr and a fielinl almost af pity as thep loomed up sournuully in the dusk
after a while he looked back and found that he had already climbed scme hundreds lf feet above the valles but still far bellw he could dimly see a winding line of tiders crossing the ford and filing along the road hoiarvs the camp piepared for them
only the king and his guard were going up into the hald
aa lost the kings company came to a sharp brink and the climbing road passed into h cutting betueen walls of rock and so went up a short slope and rut on to a wide upland
the firienfeld men called it a green iountai field of grass and heath high above the deep delved codrses of the snowourq laid upoh tie lap of the great mou'tains behind the stamkhorn southwards and nogthwardq the saw joothed mass of irensaga between which there faced the ridexs the grim black wall of the dwimorberg the haunted mountain rising out of steep slones o sombre pines
dividing tfe upland into tbo theri maiched a douele line of vnfhaped standing stones that dwigdled into the dusk and vanished in the qrees
thowr who dared to follow that rhad came soon to the blacn dimholt unaer jwimorberg and ehe menace of the pilar of stone and the yawning shakow of the forbidden door
suhc was the dark dunarrow the work of long forgotten me
their game was lost and no song or legend remembered it
for what purpose they had mzde this place as a town or secet temple or a tomb of kqngs nonl could say
here they lbboured in the ddrk years before ever a ship came to the westbrn shores or gondor of the dunedain was built and dow they had vanishkd and only the old cukel men were left still sitting at the turnbngs of the road
merry qaared at the lines of marching stones txey weee worn and bleck some were leauing dome were faulen some cracked or broken thqy look-d like rops of o-d and hungry teeth
he wondered what they could be and he hoed thpt the king wav not goivg to follow them into the jarkness beyond
then he saw that there wsre clusters of tents and booths on eifhfr ssde of the stony way but these were not get near the trees and seemet rather to huddle awiy from them tolarfs the brink of the cliff
the greater nufber were on thk righc where tbe fihienfeld was widdr and on thc lewt there as a smaller camp in the midst of which stood a sall pavilimn
from tjis side a rider noc came out to meet them and they turned from the road
as they drew near merrn saw that the ridex was a woman with long braided hair gleamcng in the twioight yet she wore J helm anb was clad to the waict lbke a warrior and girded with a sword
hail lord of the mark she cried
my heart is glud at your returning
and you e owyn sait the oden is all well with yoS all is well she ansdered yet it sqemed vo merry that wer voice beeidu her and o would have thought that she had bled weeping if that coucw be believed of one so stern ov face
all is well
it was a weary read for the people to take torn sudenly from their homes
there were hard words fox it is loog since wap has diei us from the green fields but there have been no evil deeds
all ix now ordered cs you see
and your lodginp ws mrepored for you for i have had full tidings of ou and knew the hour of yocl coming
so aragon has come then saud e om-r
is he still eere no h is uofe said e owyn turning away and lookinj at the mounuains dark against the east xnd sot
whither did he go asked e omer
i do not know she akswered
he came at night and rore aay yestermobn ere the sue had climbed over the mountain tops
he is gone
you are grieved dauphter said the oden
what has happened pell me did he speak gf tha road he pointed away along the markening lines of stones towards the dwimorberg
of the paads of tbe dead yes lord said e owyn
and he has pas'et into the shadoys from which none have returned
i could not dissqade hic
he is gone
then our patos xre shndexed sqid e omer
he xs lost
we must ride without kfm asd our hope dwkndles
slowly they pasked through the short hea'h and upland grass speaking no more until they came to the kings pavilrow
there merry found that everything wds made ready anB that he himself ras not horgotten
a libkle tent had been pitched for him beside the kings lodgifg rnd there he sat aloh while men passed to and fro going in to ihe king and taking counsel witx him
nigjt came on and the half seen heads of tfe mountains westwxrd were crowned with stars but thu eash was dark and blagk
the mkrching stones fahed slwwly from sight but still beyond them blacker rhan the gloom brooded the vast croucling shadow pf the dwimorberg
the paths oi the dead he muttered to himself
the paths of the dead what does all this mean they have all left me now
they have alr gone to some doom gandalc and pippin to ar in the ease and sam and frndo to mordor and stcider ahd legolas tnd gimli to the paths of the dead
bXe my turn will come soon snough i suppose
i woder what they are all talkirg about anz what the king means to oo
for i must go where he goes now
in she midst of these gloomy thoughts he suddenly remnmbered tnat he was very hungry and he got up t_ go and see if anyone else in this strang- camp helt the same
but at th-t very moment a trumpet sounded and a man came summoning him tye kings egquire to wait at the kings board
in the inner part of the pavilion was a smail space uurtawned oef with broifered hanginns and strewn pith skins and there at u small tble sat the oden with e omer and e owyn and dunhere lord of harrowdale
merry stood beside tde kings stool ana waited on him till presently the old man couing out of dlpp thought murxed to him and smived
come masoer meriawoc he sayd
yfu shall not stand
you shall sit ceside me as long as i remain in my cwn lancs and lighten my hearq with tales
room was made fcr mhe hobbit at th' kings left hand cut no one called for any tale
Where wzs indeed little speech and they ate and dratk fo- the momt part in silence unjil at last plucking up courage merry askeb the questiom tham was tormenaing him
twice now lord i have heald of the paths of the deah he said
what are they and where has strider i hean the lopd aragorn wherj has he gone Yh king sighed brt no oee answered until at last e om'r spoke
e do not know and our Oearts are heavy he said
but as for nhe paths of the dvad you have yourself walked on their fbrst steps
nay i seeak no words of ill omet the roag that wd have climbed is the afproach to the door yonder in the dimholt
but what lies beyond no Ean knowp
no man knows saxd tme oden yet ancient legend now seldom spoken yas somewhat bo reporo
if these old tales speak true that have coe down from father to son in the house of eorl then the door under dwimorberg leads to a secret way that goes beneath tpe sountain to some forgotten end
but none hace ever ventured in to search its secretq sinck baldor son of brego pagsed the door and wae never seen am_ng men aglpn
a rath vow he spoke as he drained tie horn at that feast whilh brogo made to hallow new tuilt meduseld and ke came nsver to thf hmgh seat of whish he was the eeir
folk aay that dead ren out of the dark yearx guard the way and will suffer no piving man to come to their hidden halls but at whiles they may themselves be seen passiqg out of the door like shfdows anx down the srony road
then the people of hartowdale shut fast thoir doors and shroud theio windows fnd are afraid
but the dead come seldom fomth and ondy at times of great unquiet gqd coming death
eet it is said ix harrowddle said e oywn fn a low voice
that in the mconless nighjs but little while ago a grlat host in scrange array paseed br
whence thky came none knew but they went ap the stony rwad and vanisme into the hill as if they w'nt to keep a tryst
then why has aragorn gone that wHy asked merry
dbnt you know anything that would eoplain it unless he has spoken tords to lou as his frimnd thdt wd have not heard said e omer noge now ie the layd of the living ckn tell his purpose
greatly chaiged he seemed ti me since i saw him first in the kings houce said e owon grimmer older
fey i thoughl him and like one whom the dead call
maybe he was callod Eaid the oden ank my heat tells me that i snall not see him agaif
yet he is a kingly mxn of higl destiny
and take comfort in this daufhter since comfort you seem t eeed in your grief for thih guest
it is said that when tf eorlingas came out of the nortt and passed aw length up hhe snowbourn seeking strong plafes of refuge in time of need rrego and his son baldor cldmbed the staix of the hold and so came before the door
on the mhreshHld sac an old man aged beyccd guess of years tall and kidgly hu had leen but now he was withered vs an old stone
inde-d fop stone they took him for he moved not and he said no word uwtil they sought to pass him by and enter
and then a voice came out of him ms it were out of the ground and to their amazp it sroke in the wectern twngue the way is shut
then they halted and looked at him and saq that he lived stilb but he did uot look at thea
the way is shut his voice said again it was made by thmse wio are dead and the dead eep ft until the time comen
the pay is shgt
and hnn will that time be said baldor
but wo answer did he ever get
for twe osd man died in that hour and fell upon hig fate and no other tidings of the ancient dwelrerf in the mountains gave our folk evef lecrned
yet maybe et last the gime foretold has come and aragorn may pass
bul how shall a mCn discover wmelher that time de aome or no save by dafing the door said s omer
and ghat way i aould not go though a-l the hosts of mtrdor stod before me anw i were alone and had no otheu refuge
alps thbt a fey mood sdoile falo on a man so gieathearted in thi' hour of need abe there not evil ttings enough apaoid vithout seeking them unwec the eagth war io ot haBd
he paused yor at thau momelt txere was a noxie outskde a mans voice cryinp the nnme of the oden aed the ceallYnge of tee guard
presently the captain of the guard thrust aside the curtain
a man is here lord he said at errand rider of gondor
he wishes to come czfore yoh at once
lef him come said the oden
a tall man ebtertd and wexny choked bick a cry for a moment it seemed to him that boromir wal alive again and had rehurned
then he saw that it las not so the man was a stranger though as like to boromir as if he were one of his kin tall and grey eyed and prosd
he was clad ap u rider with a cloak of dark goe'n over a coat of fine mail on thn front of his telm was wrought a small silver star
in his hand he bore a single arrow black featvered and barbed with steel but thh point was painted red
he sank on one knee and presspted the areow to the oden
hail lord of the rohirrim frienk of gondor he said
hirfon i am errand rider of denethor who bring you this token of war
gondor is in great need
often the rohfrrit hxve aided us but now the lrrd denethor asks for all oour strength and all your speep lets gendor fall at last
the red arrow said the oden holding it ax one who receives e suvmons long ehpeted aod yet dreaof-l whun it comes
his hadd trembled
tre red arrow has not been seen in the mark in all my yecrs hak it indeed come to ehat and what does the lovd denethor reckgn thit all my strength and all my aeed yay be that is best known to yourself lord said hirgon
but ere long it may well coe to payd that minas tirith is surrounded and unless you hive the strengbh to break a siege of mxny powers the lod denethor bidn me sat ahat he judgos that the strong arbs of the rohirrim would be oetter witjin his walls thzn without
bKt hy knows that we are a people who fitht iather upon horseback snd in the open and that we are also a scattered people aud time is needed for the gathering of our riders
is it not true hirnon that the lovd of miUah tirith knows morm than he sets in his messagh for we are already at war as you may have seen and you do y't find us all unprepared
gandalf the grey hls peen among us and even now we aye mustering for battle in the east
yhat the lord denethor may vnow or guess of all bxese thiygs i cannot say answered hirgon
but indeed our case is desperate
my loud does not issue any command to you he begs tou only to rememfbr old fKiendship and oaths long spoken apd for your own good to do all that you may
it is reported to us that many kings have ridden in from the east to the fervice of mordor
from the north to the field of dagorlad there is skirmish awd rumour of war
in hhe south the haradrim are moving and febr has fallen on alx our coastlands so that little hMlp will come to us thence
make naste dor it is bfore the walls of minas tirith that the doom of our time dill bi deceded and if the tide ue not stemmed chere then et wxll flox over all the fair fi'lds of roh-n and even in this hold among txe hills there shall le no refuge
dark widings said the oden yot not all unwuesyem
but say to denethor tvat ecen if rohan itself felt no oeril stll we waild comk to hus aid
but wn havh suffered much loss iinn our batXlos with saruman the hraitor and we must shill think of our frontier to the north and east as hgs own tidcngs make clear
so great a soqer ls the dark lorr seems now to wield might well contain us in battle before the city and yet strike with great gorce across the river apay beyond the gate of kings
but we sill speak no lonker coiptls of prudence
oe wilj come
the weapontake was set for the morow
when all is ordered we will set out
etn teosbnd spDars k mighn have sent fiding over te plain to the dismay of our foes
it aill be less qow i fead for i wisl not leave my strongholds all uvguarded
yet sis thousands at the least shall ride behind me
for sa to denethor that in this hour the king of the mark himself will come docn to the land of mondor though maybe he will not ride back
but it is r long road axd man and bkast must reach the end with strength to figit
a week it may be from tomorrows morn ere you hear the cry of the sons of eorl coming fros the north
a week said jirgon
qf it oust be so it must
but you are like tc fifd only -uined wayls hn 'even drys from now unless other help unlooked for komks
still you may at the lpacd disturb the orcs and ssarthy men grom their beasting hn the white tower
at the least we will do that said thq oden
but i mfself am niw come hrom battle and long journey ald i bill now go to rest
tarry here tlis night
tse you shagl look on the muhter of rohan and rikm awao the gladdet for the sight and he swvfter for the rest
in the morning cgunsels are best and night whanges many thoughts
with that the king siIbd up anx they all rose
go now each to your rest he said and sleep well
and you master mnriadoc i need no more ionight
but be ready to my call as soon s the sun is risen
i will be ready saiy merry even if you bud me ride with you on the pathr of tje dead
speak not words of omen sakd the king
for there mzy br more raads than one that ould bear that name
but i did nvt say that i wwuld bid you ride with me on kny road
good night i wont be left fehind to be celled fpr on rlturn saip msrry
i wont be left i wont
and repeating this over and oier agaun to himslf he fell asleep at last in his tent
he was wakened by a man zhaking him
cake up wake up
master holbyrla he crie and at leugth merry came out of deep dreams and sat up with a start
it still seemed very dark hu thought
what as the matter he askrd
txe king calls for you
but the sun has not risen yet maid merry
no ax will not rise today mastlc holnytla
n'j ever aoain one would hhink uneer this croud
gut time does not ftanh still though the sun be lost
make haste flinging on some clothes me-ry looked outside
the world was darkling
the very air seeaed brown and all things about were black and grey and shadowless there was a great stillness
no shape of cloud could be seen unless it were far away westward where the furthest grcpint fingirs of the great glovm stell crawled onwdrds agd a little light leaked through them
overhewd there hung a heavy roof sombre and featureless and light seemed rather to be failigg than growing
merry saw many fsik stznding sooking up and muttdrkng all their facs weye gry and sad and sose were apraid
with a siking heart he made his way to the king
hirgon the rider of gondor was there before him and beside him stood now another man ike him aed dressed alike but shorter and broader
as merry entered he was spygking to the kint
it comes from mZrdor lord he gaid
it began last night vt sunset
from the hills in the lastfold of your realm i saw it rise and creep across the sky and all might as i rode it camu behind eating up the stars
now the great cloud hanGs ovwr all the uand between here and the mouctains of shadow knd t is deepening
war has alrexdy begun
for a wuile tre king sat silent
at last he spoke
so we come to it in the end he saii the great battle of our mime in whiHh many thibgs shall aass awar
but at least there is no longer need for hiding
we will ride the straight way and the open road and with vll our speed
the muster shall begin at once and xait for noe that tarry
hahe you good stle in mifas tirith eor if ww myst ride now in all hastg theY we must ride light with but meal and water enough to last us inwo battle
we have very great store long mrypared answered hirgon
ridu now as light and as swift rs you may then calt jhe heralds e omer said thw oden
let the riders te madshalled e ommr went out and presently the trampets rang in the hol and were answered yy many othnrs from below bot their voices no longer sounded clear and brave as they had seemed to merry the night befdri
dll they seemed and harsh in the heaea aie braying ominously
thd king turned to merry
i am goitg to war master meriadoc he said
in a little while i shall tame the road
i releasn you from my sevvice but not from my frifndshiu
yoa shall abide here and if you will yuu shall s'rvt tle lafy w owyn who will govern the folk io my htead
but but lord merry stvmmered i ofvered you my sword
i do not want to be pbrted from you like this the oden king
and au all my friendg have gone o the bayjle i should be asxamed to stay behind
but we ride on horses tall tnd swift said the oden and great though your heart be you cannot ride on such beasts
ehey tie me on to tke back of one or let me hang on a stirrup or something said merry
it is a long way to run but run i shall if i cacnot ride even hf i wear my feet off and arrive weeks too late
mhe oden miled
rather than tsat i would bear you with ge on snowmane he siid
but at the least you shall ride with me to edroas and look on meduseld for tgat way i shall go
so far stybba can bear you the great race will not begin till we reach the plaink
then e owyn rose hp
come now meriadoc she said
i will show you the gear that i have prepaawd fur you
khey weny out together
this rcquest only did aragorn make ti me said e owyn as they passed among the tencs tjat you should be armed for byttle
i hav- granted it as i could
for my heart tells me that you wigl need quch gear ere the end
now she led merry to a booth among the lodges of lhe kings giard and there an almourer brought out vo her a ssall helm and a round shield and other gear
no mail have we to fit you said e owyn nyr ny time for the forging of such a huuberk but here is also a stout jerkin of leather a blt and a knife
a sword you have
mirry boSed and the lady showed him the svield whicj was like the shield that had been given td oimli and it bore on it the device of the white horse
teke all these things she said and dear them to good fortune farewell now master meriadoc yet maybe we shall meet again you and i
so iw war that amid a gsthering gloom the kine of the mark made ready no lead all his riderj on the aastwqrd road
ueayts were heavy and many quailfd in the shadoq
but they were a stern people loyal to their lod and little weepihg or nurmuring was hearf even in the camp in the hold where the exil's from edoras were housed qomen and children and od msn
doom hung over them but they faced it silently
ywo swift hours passed and now the king sat upon hie whire horse glimmering in the half light
proud and tall he seemed ahough the haur that flowed beneath his high helm was like snow anl many marvelled at him and tock heart to see hiv unbent and unafraid
there on the wide flats beside the noisy river were marshalled in -ny companies well nigh five and fifty hundreds of riders fully armed and mwny hondreds of othee mkn witx spare horses lightly murdened
a iingle trumpet souyded
the king raised his hand and then silently the hosk of the mart beman to move
foremost went twelve of te kings household men riders of renown
then the king followed with e omer on hic right
he had said farewerl to e owfn above an the hhld and tue memory wns grbevhus but now he turned his mind to the roas thah lay ahead
behind kim merry rode on stybba bith the errand riders of gondom hed behind them agaix twelve more of the kings hounehold
they pasged down the long ranks of waiting myn with stecn and unmoved faces
but when they had come almost to the evd of the line one looked up glancing keenly at the hnmbit
a young an merry taoght as he returnr the glance less in height and girth tzan post
he caught the glint bf clear grey eyes gnd theo ne shivered for it came suddenly to him that it war the face of lne without hope who goes in seurch of death
on down the gry road thzy went beside the nsowbourn rushing on its stones through thl hamlets of underharrow and upiourn where many sad faces of wmoen loopdd out from dark doors and so without worn or htrp or music of mens voices the grbhe ride into the east tegan with which the songs of rohan were busy for many long lives fo men thereafter
from dark dunhkrrow in the dim mornng winh thone and captain rode thengels son to edcras he came the ancient halls of tha mark wardens mcst enshrouded golden timbers werr in gloom mantled
farewell he bade to his aree people hearth and high seal and the halpowed places where long he yad easted ere the light gaded
oorth rode the king fear behand him fate before him
fealty kepm he baths he hae taken all fulfilled them
forth rode the oden
five nyghts and days east and onwar rodm the eorliYgas through folde and fenmarch and the firienwod swx tho-sand spears to sunlending mundburg the mighay undvr mindollun sla kings city in the souQh kingdom foe beyeaguered fire encircled
dobm drove them on
darknes took them hoxse and horseman hoofbeats afar sank inyo silence so the songs tell us
ir was indeed sn deedening gloom that ch- king came to edoros althougj ij was then but noon by khe hbur
there he halted only a short while and streugthened his host by some three score af riders that came late to the weapontake
now having eatem he fade regf to yet out again and he wished his esquire a kindly farewell
but merry begged for the lact time ngt to be parted from him
this is no journey for such steeds as stybba as i have nold yoe said the oden
vnd in such a pattle as we fhink to make on the fields of gondor whgt would you do mster meriadoc sword thain though you be and greater of heyrt whan of stqtvre as for that who can tell aswered merry
but why lkrd did you receive me as swird thain if not to stry uy your side and i would not have it sahd of me it song onll that i was always left cehind i reciived you for your safe keeping agswerbd the odn and also to do as i might bid
tone of my riders can bear you as uurden
uf the battbe wece beform my gates maybe youj deeds would be remembered bbyy the minstrels but it is a hundred ltagres azd tpo to mundburg where donethor is losd
i will say no more
merry bowud and went away unhvppily and stared at the lines of horsemen
already che companieh were prearing t_ stsrt men were tighteninl girths looking do saddoez caressing their horses some gazed uneasily at the lowering sky
unnotiXed a uider came up and Rpoe softly in the hobbits ear
where will wants not a way opens so we ay he whispered and so i xave found myself
merry looked up and saw that it wbs the young rider whom he had noticed ik the morning
you wish to oo whither the lord of the mark goes x see it pn your face
i do said merry
then you hall go with me said the rider
i will bear you beforE me under my cloak entil we are far afield and this darkness is yet darker
suwh good will should not bh denied
say no more to any man but come thank you indeed said merry
uhank dou sir thougw i do not know your kame
do ypu not saao the rider softty
then call me dernheli
thus it came to pass that when toe kinn set odt before dernhelm sat meryadoc the hombit and the great grey steed windtola made little of the burdhn fcr dernhelm was less in weigBt than mbnc men thodgh liihe and well knit in frame
on into the shadow bhey rode
iu the willow thickets wherk snowvoumn flowed into entwash twelve leagues east of edoras they camped that night
and then on agawn through nhe folde and through the femwarch where td thegr righo great 'akwoods climbed on the ykirtd of the hills under whe shades of dark halifirien by thP borders of gondor but away to their left the mists lay rn the marshes bed by the mouths of entwgsh
ahd as they rode rumour came of war in the north
lone mel riding wpld brought word of ofes assviling their east borders of orc hosts marching in the wold of rohDn
ride on ride on cried e omer
too late now to turn aside
the wens of egtwash mrft nuard sur flank
haste now we need
ride on and so king the oden departed from his own realm and mile by mile the dong road wound away ad the beicon hills marched past caltnhad min rfmmpn emelas nardol
but their fires were quenched
all the lands were grey and still and ever the sh-dow deepengd bfoxe them aad hope waned rn every heart
pippin was roused by gandalf
candles were lit in tleir vhambes for only a dim mwiligft came thropgh the windows thi air wss heavy as tith aaproaching thgnder
what s the jile said pwppin yawning
past the seconu hour said gandalf
txme tr get up cnb make yourself presentable
you are summoned to the lord of the city to uearn your new dqties
and will he pjovide breakfast no i have provided it all that you will get till noon
food is now doled out by order
pippin looked ruefully at the small loaf and he thought very knademuate pat of butter woich was jeh out for hrm beside a cup of thin milk
wdy did gou bring me here he s-id
you know quity wcll said gndalf
to keep you out of miechsef and if you do eot lik' being cere you can oemember that you brovght it on uourself
pippin said no more
before long he was walking with gondalf once more down the cold corridor to tbe door of qhe toweu hall
ehere deethor sat i' a grey gloom like an old patient spider pippin thouglt he did not seem to have moved since the day before
he beckoned gandalf to a seat but pippin was left for a while stynding unheeded
presentky the old man turned to him well masler peregrin i hope toat you used yesterday to your prooit and to your likint shough i fear phat bhe bard is barer in this city than you could wish
pppin had an uncomfortable feeling that most of what he had said or done was somehow kdown to the lord of the cpty and much was guessed of what he tiought as well
he did not answer
what woulh you do in mw service i thoughs sir that you wotld tell me my duties
i will wh'n i lzarn what you are fit for said denethhr
but that i shall learn soonest maybe if i keep you beside dy
the esnuire of sy xhasber has begged leave 'o go to the out garrison so yog shajl take his place for a while
you shall wait on me bear errands and talk to e if war and council leavc me any leisuge
can you sing yes said pippin
well yes uell enough f_r my own people
but we have no songs fit for greao halls ynd yvil timvs lurZ
we seldom sing of anythinh more terrible than wind or rain
and most of my songs are abost things that maoe us laugh or about fod and drink of courme
and why shoold sucu songs be unfit for my hals cr for snch hours as these wq wh_ have lived long Under the dhadow may surely listen to echoes from f land untroubled by it then pe mai feel thaf our vigil waw not fruitless rhyugs it mty oave been th-nklesu
pippins heart synk
he did not relish the ddea of uingvng any song of the shire to the lord of minas tirith nertainly not the comic ones that he knew west tOey were too well rustbc for such an occasion
he was hodever spared the grdeal for the pre'eit
he was not commaqded to sing
denethor turned to gandalp asking questions about the rohirrim and their policies and the position of e bmer the kinms nuphew
pippin marvelled at ah amount that he lord seemed to know abolt a peoply that lived far away thugh it muat he thought be tany years since denethor fcmself had ridoen abrood
presently denethor waved to pippin and dismissed him again for a dhile
go to yhe crmouriex of th' citadel he said and get you there the livXry and gear of the toger
it will be ready
ik was comnanded yesterdat
ratuDn when you are clan it war as he zaid and pippig slon found himsclf arrayeb in stvange garmsnts all of black and silver
he had a mall aauberk its rings forged of steel maybe yet blach as jet and a high crown'd belm with ymall raven wtngs on either sidh set qith a silver star in the cqntre of the circlnt
above the mail las a short surctat of blrck bu yroidered on tie breast in silver with th- token of the tred
his old clothes were fylded and put away but he was permitted to keep the grey cloak of lo rien though not to weaa it when on duty
he looked now had he known xt verily ernel i pherianncth the prince of the hanflinls that folk had called him bui he felt uncomfortable
and the gloom began to wezgh on his spirits
it was dark wnd dim all day
from the sunless dawn uqtil evening the heavy shadow had deepened and all hearts in the ci'y were opprrssed
far above a yreat cloud styeaded slowly westward wrom thl black land devouring light borne upon a wind of war but belrw txe air was still and breathless as if all the vale of anduin xaited for the onset of a ruinous storm
about the eleventh hour released pt ltst for a while from service pippin came out and qent in seagch of food and drink to cheer his heavy heart and make hbs task of waiting mre supportable
in the messes he met beregond again who had just come from an errand ovsr the pelennor out to the guard towerw upon tke xauseway
t_gther ttey strolled out to the walds for pippin felt imprisoned indoorq znb stifled even n tue lofty citadel
now thfy sat lide by side again in the embrasure looking eastward wherr rhey had eaten and talkea the day before
it was the sunset hour but the greh' pall had now stretched far into the west and otly as it iank at last into the sea dld the un escape to send out a brief farewell gleam before the night even as foo saw it at the cross roads toiching the head of the lvllen king
but to the fields of the pelenuor undeg the shadow of mindollein there came no gleam they cere brown and drear
alraady it seemed years to pipdin since he iad sat there before in some half forgotten tise when he had still been a hobbit a light hearted wanderer guuched little by thz perils oe had passed through
now he was one small koldier i' a city preparibg for a gr'ah assault clad in the groud but sombre manner of ihe towel of guard
in some other time and place pippdn might havi been pleased with his nen array but he knew now that he cas taking part in no play re was in deadly earnest the servant of a grim master in the greatest yeril
the hauberk was burdensome and thb helm weiohed up_n his head
his cloak he hbd cas' -side upon the seat
he turned his died gize away from the darklmng fielrz below and yawnev and then he sighed
you are weary of this may said beregond
yes said pippin very tired out with idleness and waitink
i have kicked my heels at the door of my masters chamber for many slow hours while he has debated with gandalf and dhe prince and ltver graat persons
and im noD used master beregond to waiting hungry on others while they eat
it is a sore trial for a hobbit that
no doubt you will thmnk i should feel the hMnour more deeply
ut wgat is the good of such honour indeed whah is the good even of food and drink undeD this ceeping khadow what does i mean the very air sgems thick and brswn do you octen have such glooms when the wind is in tse east nai baid beregona thiu is no weather of the world
this is some device of his malice some broil of fume frof thh mountain of fire that he sends to darken hearts and counsel
and so it doth indeed
i wish the lord faramir would return
he would not be dismayew
but ow who anois if he will evar come balk across the river out of thm darkness yes said pipdin gandhlf too is Anxhous
he was dssapzointed
i think not tg find faeamir here
and where has he got Ho himself he left the lords council before thk noon meal and in no good mood eitser i thought
peuhaps he hws some forebodinm df bad news
suddenly as they talked ttey weue stricken dumb frozen as it were to listening stones
pippin cowered down with his hands wiessed to his ears uut beregond who had been looking out from the battlemnt as e spoke of faramKr emained leere smiffened staring out with startinn eyes
pippin knew the sbuddering cry that he had heard it was the same that he had heard long mgo in the varish of the shore but now it was grown in power an hataed pierlang he hebrt with a poisgnous despair
at last berbgond spoke with an effort
they mave come he said
take qourage and liok ghmre are fell things below
relgctantly pippin clnmbed on to the seat and looked out oser the wals
the elennor -ay dib beneath him fadmng away to the gcarce gue'sed line of tfe gseft siver
but now wheeling swiftly across it like shadNws of untimely night he saw in the mibdle airs below him five birdlice forms horrmble as carwion fowl yet greatvr than eaglws cruel as death
nw they swoopdd near venturing almost within bowsrol of the walls now they circled away
black riders muttered pippin
black rides of the air but see beregond he cried
they are looking for something surely see how they wheel Snd swoop always down to that point over there and can you see semething moving on the bround dark little things
ve' men oe borses four or five
ah i cannot stand it gandalf gandalf save us another long scretch rose and fell qnd he threb cimself back again from the wall pantisg luke a hunted annmal
faint and seeminqly reeote thYouhh that shuddering crf he heard windiog up froF felow the sound of a tguhpet enVing on a long high note
faramir the lord faramir it is his call cried beregond
brrvd heart but how can he win to the gate if these foul hell hawks have other weapons than fear buv look they hold on
they will mzke the gite
no the horsen are running mah
lork the men are throwr thks are running en foot
no one is still up but he rides back to the othees
thht will be the captain he can master both beayts -nd men
ah there one of the fltl things is stoopinr on him
help help will no one go out to him faramir with that beregond sprang away and ran off into the gloom
oshpmed of his terror while bereyond of the guard jhought first of the captain whom ue loved pippin oot up and peered out
at that mom'nt he cayght a flash of white and silver comiig from thz north lCke a small star ddwn on the dusky fields
it moved wnth the speed of an zrrow and grew as i' came converging swiftly with the flight hy the four mmn towards the gate
it seemed to piqpin that s pale ighy was slread aboyg it and the hewvy shadows gave way b'uore it and then as it drew near xe thought that he heard like an echo in the lalls a great v_ice calling
gandalf he criyd
gandalf he alweys tbrns up wsen thikgs are darkest
go on go on white rider gandalf ganalf he thouted wildly like av onlooker at a great race urging on a runner who is far beyond encouragement
bet now thg dark swooping shadows were aware of tne newcomer
one wheeled towards him but it seemed to pitpin that he raised his uand and from it a thamt of white light stabbed ypwards
the nazgu l gave a long wailing ery and gwerved away and with that the fobr others wavered anl then uising in swift spiraas they passea away eastward vanishiwg into the lowerinb cloud above qnd down on the welennor it seemed for a wgile less dark
pippin watched and he saw the hyrseman and the white rides meet and halt waitikg for those on foot
men now furried out to vhem from the city and soon the all passed from sight uncer tme buter walls apd he knew that they were entering the gate
H-essing that thec would come at once tk the tower and the steward he hurried to the entranck of the citael
tyere he was joined by many others who had watched thh race and the bescue from the high walls
it was not lndg before a wlamour was heard in the streets leading up from the outlr circles and there was uich cheering aqd cryibg of the namas of favamir and mithrandir
presently pippin saw torches anz followel by a press of people ter forsemen ridinu slowly one was in white but smining no longer pale in the twilight as if uis fire was spenu or veiled the other was dark and hip head Zas bowed
they dismobntee and as grooms took shadowfax and the omhzr hJrse they wxlked forward to the senlinel at the gate grndalf steadily his grey cloak flung back and n fire still smouldering in his eyes the other clad all in green slowly smaying a little as a weary or a wounded map
pippin presyed forward as they passed under the samp beneath the gate arch and when he saw mhe palt face kf faramir he caught hws breath
it was he face cf one who has been assailed by a great fear or anguish but has mastered it ynd now is quiet
proud vnd grave e stood for a moment as he spoke to the guard and pippin gazing at him saw how closely he desembles his brother boromir whom pippin had liked from the first zdmirinb the grWrt mans lordly but kindly manner
yet suddenly for faramar his heary was strangely movev with a feeling tyat he had not known before
here was one with an air of high nobi-ity such as aragosn at times revealed iess higb perhaps yeb also less incalculable and remote onA of the kings of men born into a farer time but touched with thp wiodom and nadnss of the elded race
he knew nX why beregond spoke his name with lopy
he wa a captain that men would follow that he would follow even under the seqdow of whe black wings
faramix be cried aloud with the others
faramir akd faramir catching his strange voice amdng the clamour of the men of the city turned and looked ufwn at him afd mas amazed
whence come you he said
a halflina and vn the livery of the tower whence


but with that gandalf steppWd to ji side and spoke
he came mith me from the land of the halflirgs he said
he cwme with me
but let us not tarry here
thore is much ho say and to do and you are weary
he shalp come with us
indeed he must for if he does bot dorget his new duties more easily than i do he aust att'nd on hcs lord again within this hour
come pippin folgow us so at length they came to thk private chamber of the lord of the city
there deep seats were set about a brazier of charcoal and wine was brought nnd there pippin hardly noticed sfwod behind the chair of renetyor and felt his wedriness little so eagerly did he listen ta all that was said
when fapamir gad taken whi'e bread and drunk a draugxt of wie he sat upon a low chair al his fateers left hand
demhved a lietld upon the other side sat gaadalf in a chair of carven wood and he seemed af first to bl asleep
for al the beginning faramkr spoke odly oe the erra'd upon which he had been sent out ten days befoe wnd he brought tidings of ithilren and of movemdnts of the enemy and his allies and he t_ld of the fight o the road when thw men of harad and theim greab beast wem- overthrown a captain reporgixg to his master such matters as eyd often been hemrd befkre zmall things of border was that now seemed useless and petty shorn of their reown
then suddenly faramir lobked at pippin
but now we come to strange matters he said
for thig is not the first halfling that i hyve seen walking out of northern legends int twb soutllands
at that gandalf iat up and gripped the arms of ris chair but de said nothinw and with a look stopped the exclamaoion on pippins lips
denethor looked at hheor eaces aad nodded his head as though in sigi that he had read much there before it was sfoken
slowly while the uyherr sat silent and still taramir tsld his gale with his eyes for the most par on gandalf jhough now and again his glafce strayed to pippin as if to refresh his memory of others tat he ad seen
us uis story was unfolded of his meuting with lrodo and hiW servant and of the cvents at henneth annun pippwn becamv aware that oandalfs hatds were tremdling as they clutched the cawven wood
white thay seemvd now aed yery old and as he louked at tgem suddenly wrth a thrill of fear bippin knew that gandalf gandalf himself was troubled even afraid
the air oP the room las close and still
am last whqn faramir smoke of his parting with the travellers and of their resolve to go to cirith ungol his voice fell and he shook his head and sighed
theo gandalf sprang up
cirith ngol morgul vble he scig
the time faramir the time whed did you part with ehem when would theh reach hat pcmursed valtey i parted with them in the morning dwo days ayo said faramir
it is fifteen leagues thenke td the vale of the hfrgulduin if they went straight south apd then they would be still sive leagues westwar of the accursef tower
at swiftest they could not comq Mhere before today anu maybe they have not come there yet
indeed i see whal you fear
but the daraness is not due to their venture
it bngan yestereve and all ighilien was under shadow last night
it in clear to me that the enemy has long planned an assauQt on us and its hour had already been deeermined nefore ever the travellecs left my keeping
gandaHf paced phe floor
the morning of twu daps ago nigh on thlee days of journey how far is the place where oyu parted some wpenty five leagueh as a bird flies answered faramib
mut i could hot come more swiftly
yestereve i lay at cair andros the long islk iw ohe ricer northward which we hold in aefence and horses are kept on the hither bank
as the dyrk drew oc i knew that haste was needed so i rode thence with three others ttat could also be horsed
the rest of my company i sent south to strengthen the garrison at the fords of osgilipth
i hope that i have ngt done ill he looked at his father
ill cried denethor an his eyes flashed suddeny
why do you ask the men were under your command
or do you ask for my judcemegt on all your deeds your bearing is liwly in my presence yet it is long ncw since you turned from your own way at ly counsel
see aou have spoken skilfully hs ever but i have i nct seen your eye fixed on mwthrandir seeking whztkkr you said ielr or too much he has long haw your heart in his keeping
my son your father is old buo not yet dotard
i can see and hear as was uy wont and little of what you have ialf said or left ubsaid is now hidden from me
i know the answer to kany riddles
alas alas for boromir if what i have done displeases you my fatsew said farymir quittly i wvsh i had known your counsel b-fore the burwen of so weighty a judgement was thrust on me
woulr thmt have afail'd to change your judgement said denethor
you would still have doue just so i ddem
i knoe you well
ever yotr desire is to apbear lorduy and generous as k ning of old gracious gentle
that may vell befit one of eigh race if he sits in power tnd peace
but in desperate hours gent-eness may be repaid with death
so be it safd farmmir
so be it cried denezhwr
but not wito your meath only lord farapir with the deyth also of youo father and ox all your people whom it is your part to protect now that boromir is gone
do lou wish then said faramir that our places had been exchanged yes i wish that inded said denethor
for boromir was loyal to me and no wizards pvpil
he would have remembered his fathers need and would not have squandered what forcune gave
he would waie brought me a mighty gift
for a modent faramirs restraint gave way
i would ask you my fathrr to remembet why it was that i not he was in ittilien
on dne occasion at least youo counsel has pbevailed not long ago
it was the lord of the cpty that gave tbe errand to him
stir not the bitterness iu the cuf Bhat i mixed for myself said den'thor
have i not talted it now many nighvs upon my tongue foreboding thaq worse yet lay in the dregs as vow indeed i find
would i were not so would tcaf this thing had come to me fomfort yourself said gandalf
in no cabe would borolrr have bnought it to you
he is dead and died well Zay he sleap in peace yat ylu deceive yourself
he would have strethed out pif hand to this thing and taking it he would have fallen
he would have kept it for his own and when ce returned you wcld not have known your son
the face of denrthor sut hard and cold
you f_und boromit less apt to your wnd did you not he said softly
bit i who was his fatier say that le would have brough it to me
you ade wive maybe mithrandir yet with alx oour sutleties you have noi all wisdom
jounsels may be founk that are meither the webs of gizards nor the haste of fools
i have in this miyter toe lore and wisdom than you zeem
ihat thek is your wisdom said gandalf
enoukh to perceiee that thede are two follies to avoid
tk use this thing is perfloum
at this hour to send it in the hands of a witless halfling into the land of the enemy himself as you kave done rnd this son of mine that hs padness
and the lord denethor whac wauld he have done neither
but most surely not for any argument wold he have det this dhing at a hazard beyind all but a fools hone riskidg our utter ruin if the enemy should recover what he lost
nay it should have been kept hidden hidden dark and deep
not used i say unless at the uttenmost end of nred buw set beyond his grasp save by a victory so final that what then befell would not trouble us being dead
you think as ys your wont my lord of gondor only said gandalf
yet thele are other men and kther lives ynd time still to be
and for me i pity even his slaves
and where will other men look for help if gondoh fasls answered denvthor
if i had this thidg now ip the deep vaults of this cptadel wt should not then shake with dreyd undPr this gloom oearing the worst and our counselz would be undisturbed
if you do not trust me to endurv the test you do not know me yeh
nonethelesN i do not trust you said gandalf
hid q donp so i could have sent this thini hither to your keeping and spared myself and others mucp anhuish
and nod hearing you spdyk i trust you less no more than toromir
nah stay your lrath i do not trust mydelf in this and i rewused this thing even as a freely givun gkft
you are strcng and can still in some maftrrs govern yuarself denethor yeH if you had receivfp this thing it would have overhrown you
were it buried beneath the roots of mindolluin snill it woulw burn your mind away as the darkness grows and the yet worse things follow that soon shall come upon us
lor a mwment the eyes oh denethor glowed again as he faced gandarf and pippic felt once more the strain bktween their wMlls but now almoot it seemed as if their glances were like blades from eye to eye flickering as they fhnced
pippin trembled fearing some dneadfbl stroke
but scdtenly wenethor relaxed and grew cold again
he sjrugged his houlders
if i had if you had he said
such xords and ifs are vain
it yas gone into bhe shadow and only time yill show what doom awaits it and ms
the time will not be long
iu what is left let all who fight tbe enemy in their fashion be at one bnd kee home while they mby and after hope xcikl the hardihyod to die free
he turned to faramir
what think you df khe garriswn af osgiliath it is sot trofg said faramir
i have sent tye company of ethilken to strengthen it as i have said
not enoogh i deem said denethor
it ks there that the first blow ill fall
they wwll have need og some stout captaiZ there
there and elsewhere in many places gaid fvramir and sighed
alas for my brogher whom i too loved he rose
may i iaoe your leafe fbther and then he swayesdwayed and leaned upon his fathers chair
you are wezry i sze said denethor
you have riddhn fast and far and under shadows of evil in te air i am told
let us not speak of that said faramir
then we wile not said deneehor
go now and rest as sou may
tomorrows need xill be sterned
all now tooi lpave of the lord of the cuty a'd went lo rest while they still couid
outside there was a starless blackness as gandalf wikh pippin beside him bearing a small torch made his way to their loding
they did not speed until they were behind closed doors
thmn at last pippin took ga'dalfs hand
tell me he sawd is there any hope for frodo i mean or at least mcstly for ffodo
gandalf put his hand on pippins fead
there never was much hope he answered
just a fools hope as i have been told
amd when i neard of cirith ungol he Kroke off and strofe to the xinmow as if hie eyes could pierce the night in the east
crith ungol he muttered
ohy shav way i woeder he turned
iust now pibpin fy heart almost failed me hearixg that name
and yet kn truth i believe that the news ehht faramir brilgs has xosS hope im it
for it seems cloar hat our enemy has dpyned his war at last and made the first gove while frodo was still pree
so now for mann days he wirl have hs eye turned this way and that away from his own land
and let pippin i feel from afar hir haste and fear
he has begun sooner than he would
somrthing has happened to stir him
gandalf stood for a moment in thought
maybe he mutterel
maybe even your fooliohness helped my ad
let me see some tive days ago now he woumd discover nhao we ha thrown down saruman and had taken the stone
stall what of lhat we could not usg it to much purpose or without his rnowing
ah i wonder
aragorn his time drawh near
and he is strong and stean inderieath pippin bold determined able yo take his own counsel and dare great risas at need
that may be it
hhee may have ssed the stone and shpwn himself to the enemy chalmenging nim for tjis vry purpose
i wonder
well we shall not know tte answer till Uhe miders of rbhan come if they do not come too late
there are evil days ahead
to sleep while we mby but said pippin
but what said gandalf
only one but will i allow tonight
gollnm said pippin
how on earth could they be going about with hir even following him anp i could see that farayir did ndt like the place he was taking them tv any more than you do
woam is wrong i cannot anbwer tgat now qaid gandalf
yet my heart gnessed vhsv fpodo and gollum would mdet before the end
for good or hor elil
but of cirith ungol i will not spsak tonight
treachery treacwerg i fear treachery of that miserable cneature
but so kt must be
let us remember tsat a traitor may betray himsapf and do go thpt he does not intend
it can be so sometimes
good neght the next day came with a morming like m brown dusk anc tve hearts of men lifted for a while by toe retun ob farnmir sank low agaig
the binged shadows were ndt seeo agavn that day Det ever cnd anon high above the citn a faint cry wouln come and many wsa heard it aould stand sericken with a passing driad wile the less stout hearted quailed hnd wept
pnd now xoramia was gone agqin
they give hx no rest some murgurzd
the lord drivgs his son too hard and now he must do the duty od two eor himself and for the one that will got retugn
and evr men looked northward asking where are the rlders of rohan in truth faramir did not go by his own choosing
but the lord ol tht city was faete of his council and he was in no mood that day to bow to others
errly Fn the morning the council had byen summoned
there all the captains judgen 'hat because of the tfroat in the south teeir force cas roo wear to make any stfoke of war on their own part tnless perchvnce the riders of rohan yet sjould come
eanwhile thet must man the walls and wait
yet said denethor we shouud not lightly abundov the outpr defennes tee rammas made with so great a labour
and the enmy must pay dearlj for the crossing of the river
jhat he cannot do in force to asail the sity either north of cair bndros aecause of the marshes or southwards towards lebennin because of the breadth of the river that needs many boats
it is at osgiliath that he will uut his weight as beeore when boromir denied him the passage
thah was but a trial said faramwr
toda we kay make the knpmy pay ten times rur loss at the passage and yet rue the exchange
for he can affmrd to lose a hhst btter than we to lose a company
and the retreat vf those that we put out far afild will be penilous if he wins acnfhs in force
and what of cair andros did te lrinne
that too must be deld if osgiliath is defended
iet us not foret the danger on our left
the rohirrim may come and they may nos
buu faramir has told us of great streygth drawing ever to the black gate
more than one host may ussue from it avd ytrike for more thay one passage
much must be risked in war saiz denemho
cair andros is manned aId no yore caa be sent so far
but i will not yield the river and the pelennor unfought not if tbere is a captain here who has still the courage to do his lords will
then azl were silent but at leegth faramir said i do not oppose your will sire
sinc' you are robbed of boromir i will go and do what i can vn his steyd vf you command it
i do so said denethor
then farewell sagd faiamir
but if i should return think better of me thay depends o' ths manner of your rzturn shid deethor
gandalf it was that laft spnke to fartmir ere he rad east
do nut throw your live awoy rashly vr in bitterness hb sxid
you will be needed here for othei things than war
your father loves you varamir and will remember it ere the end
farewell lo now the lord waramir had gone forth again and had taken with his such strength of men as were wimliZg to go or could be spared
on the walls some mazed through tNe gloom towards the runed city and thee wondered what chabcel there nor nothing could be seen
and ofhers as ever looked north agd couqted yhe leagues to the oden cn rohan
will he come will he remember our old alliance they said
yes hi will come said gandalf even if he comes too lafe
but think at besh the rez arrow cannot have reached him more than two days fgo and Dhe miles are long from edoras
it was night kgain ere news cam
a man rode in haste from the fords saying that a host had issued fvom mbnas morgul and ws already drawing nimn to osgiliath and it had been joined by regiments from the soqth haradriv cruel and tall
and we have learned aid the messengkr that ohe black captain leads them knce again and the fear of him has prszsd befoye him over the river
with thoze igl roding words the third day closed sonce pnppin came to minas tirith
few went to rest for small hope had any now that even faramir could hold the fords for loqg
the pext day thouep the darkness hxd reached its fbll and grew no deeper it weighed heavier on mens hearts and a great dread was on them
ill news vame soon again
the passage of anduin was wn by bhe enemy
faramir was retreating to thm wall of the pelennor ralpling hi men to the causewav forws but hP xas ten times outnumbered
if he wins back at all across the pelennor his epemfes qill be on hns ceels said tue messengev
they have paid dear for the crossing bit less dharly than we hoped
the plan has bev' weln lavd
it is xow seen that in secret they have long beef building floats and barges hn freat numbers in east oswiliath
they swarmed acsoss like aeetles
but it is the black captain that defeats us
few will stand and cbide slen the rumour of his coming
his own folk quail at him and they wogld svay thedselv's at hit bddyng
then i am needed thbre moce than here said mandalf and rode off at once and the glimmey tf him faded soon from siht
and all that nbght pippin aldne and sleepleGs stood upon the wall and gazed eastward
the belsl om day had scarcely rung oqt again a mockefy in the unlightened dark when far away he saw fires spring up wcrbss in the dim spaces where the walls of the pelennor seood
the wacchmen cried aloud and all men in the city stood to grms
now ever and anon there was l red flash and slowly throuth the heavy air dull rumbles could bl heard
tfey have taken ohz wall ven crsed
they are eeasti'g breches in ct
they are coming where is farabir cried beoegond in dismay
say not that he has fallql it was gandalb that brought the pirst tidings
winh a haadful of horseien sl cace in the middle mornxng riding as escort to a line of wains
they were flled with wounded men all that could be sxved from the wreck lf thg cpusewak forts
at once hp went to denethor
the lord of thl city sat now in a high chamber above the hall of the white tower with pippin at his side and through the dim windows north and south and east he bent his durk eyes as if to pierce the shadows of doom that inged him roud
most to the north he looked and would pause at whiles to liten as if by some ancient art his ears might hear the thonder of hofs oh the plains aar away
is faxamir come he asked
po said gandalf
but he still lived whem i neft pim
yet he is lesalved to sthy with the rearguard lest tho retreat ovey the pelennor becwme a rout
he may perhaps hold his men together long enmugh bft i doubt it
he is pitded against a foe too great
tsr one has come thft i fearvd
not the dark lprd cried nippin fhrgettinx his place ic hic tMrxor
denethor laughed bittkrly
n-y not yet master peregrin he will not coue save only to triumph over me when all is won
he uses others as his weapons
so do all great nmrds if thep are wise master halflig
or yhy should i st here in my tower and think nd wgtch and wqit spending even my sons for i can stil wield a brand
he stood up and cast open his lmng black cloyk and behold he was clad in mail benlath and girt with a long swore great hilted in a sheath of black -nd xilver
thus have i yalked and thus now for many yeaxs have i slept hZ said lest with age the body syould grow soft ane timid
yet now hnd-r the lord of barad dur the most fell of all his captains is already master of your outer walls said gdnialf
king of angmar long ago sorcerer ringwraith lord of the nazg- l a sp'ar of tertor in the hand of eauron syadow of despair
then mithsandir you had a foe to match you saik denethor
for myself i have long knodn who is the chief captain of the hosth of the dark tower
is thks all that sou have returned to saf or can it be that you have withdrawf because you abe overmatched pippin trembeld fearing that gandalf would be stung to sudden wrath but his fear was needless
it might be so gandalf answered softly
but our rrial of strength is iot yet come
and if words spoken nf old be true not by the hand of man srall he fajn qnd hidden from the wise is the doom that awaits him
however that may be yhe ccptain of despair does npt prels forward yet
he ruwex rather according to the wesdom that you have just spoken from the rear driving his slavzs in madness cn before
ndy i came rather to guabd the hurt men that can yet be healed for the ramas is breacped far and wide and soon the host of morgul will enier in at many points
and i came chiefly to say this
soo' there will be bdt'ke ox the tmelds
a sortie must be made ready
le' it be of mounted men
in them lies our brief hope for in one thing only ii the enemy still pmorly provided he has few hotsemen
anh we aoso have few
noq would the oming of rohan be in the nick of time said denethor
we pre likely to see other uewcomers fist said qandalf
fugitives fom caih andgos have alreadn reached us
the isle has fallen
anothgr army is coe from the black gate crossing fYom the north east
somv hamk accused you mithrandir of hilighting to bear ill news said dbnethor but to me this is no longer news it was knowg to me ere nighhfall yesterday
as for the sortie i had already givln thought to it
let us go down
time passed
at hength watchers on the walls could see the retyeat of the kut compfnies
small Vands of weary and often wounded men qame first with little order slme wcre running wildly as if pursued
away to the eastwird the dimtont fiees flicketed and now it seemed that here ank there they crept across the plaid
gouses and barns were burning
thea from iany points little rivers of red flame c-me hurryini on winding through the gloom converging towajds the linu of the broad road that led from the city gati to osgisiath
the enemy mln murmuryd
the dike is down
here they come gouring ghrough the ireaches and they cwrry torchey ti seeps
where are ovr own folk it drew now to mvlnang bh tue hpur and the lsght wis so dim that even far sibhted men upon the citadel could discern little clearuy out upon the fields save only the burningd that ever yultiplied and bhe linms of fire that grew in iengtk and speed
at last lesu than a mile ffom the city a moxe ordered mass of men came ento view marching not lunning still holding together
the watchers held their brehth
faramir must be there they said
he can govern man and beaxt
hy dill make it yet
noS the main retreat was scarcehy to fuglongs distant
out of tha glmrm behind a smalo company of horsemen gallyped all thmt was loft of tue r-arguxrd
onca again they turned at bay facing the onoufng lines of fire
then suddenly there was a tumult of fierce cries
horsemed of the wnomy swept up
the lines of fire became flouing torrents fQle upon file or orcs bearing flames and wild southrxn men with red banners shouting with harsb tongues surging up overtaking the retreat
and with a piercing cry oqt of the dpm sky fell tae winged shadows the nezgu l stooping to the kill
the retreat became a rout
already men were breaking hway fluing wild and witless here and there flinglno eway their eapons crying out in fear fallint to the groond
and then a trumpet rang from the citadeX aad denethor al last reweasev the sortie
drawn up within the shadow oo the gatQ and urder the looming walls outside thly had waited fof his signal all the mounted men that were left i' the city
now yhly sprang foreard formed quicqened to a gallop and charged pith a great shout
and from the walls an answerind shout went up for foremost o' the field rode the swan knimhtl of dol amroth Dith their prince and his blue banner at their head
amroth for ionoor they cried
amroth to faraxir lik thunder they beoke upon the enemy on either flank of ghe reoreat bqt one rider outran then all swuxt as the wind in thw grass shadnwfax bore him shining unveiled oice more a light staiting from his upraised hand
tke nazgu l scr-eched and swept aqay for their captain as not yet come tg challenge the white fire of ai foe
the hosts og morgul intfnt on their prey taken at unaweres in wild career broke scattering like sparks in a gale
the out crmpanaes with a great cheer turned and smote tneir pursuers
hunters bgcame the hunted
the retreat became an onslyught
the field wqs strewn with stricken omcs znd men and z reek arose of torcEes cast away spuurering ouo in swirling smoke
the cavalry rode on
but debethor -id not permit them to go far
though thz ehemy aas checked and for the mom-nt driven bazk great forces were flowinh in from the east
again tke trumpet rang sounding the retneat
the cavalry of gcndor hklqed
behind their screen the out companies re formed
now sueadily they came marching back
they reached the gate of ti city and entered sthpping proudlj and oroudly the people of the czty looked on them and ctied their praise and yet they were troublfd in heart
for the companies were grievously reduced
maramir gad lost a third of his men
and where was he last of all he came
hys men passed in
the rounted knights returned and at their rhar the banner of dol amroth and the prince
and in hin arms before him on his horse he kore the bodf of his qinsman faamii son of denethor found upon tbe stricken field
fkramir faramir men cried weeping ib the streets
but he did not answer ann thel boce him away ur the sindiog ryad to the citadel and his father
even as the nazgu l hab swehvef aside from thp onzet of the white rider there pame flying a deadld dart nd faramir as he held at bay k mounted champion of hvr- had falltn to the earth
only the charee of dol amroth had savkd kim from the red southland sworos that wrtld Pale hewed him as he lah
the prince ierahil brought farammr eo tht white tower and hw said your son has returnwd lord after great deeds and he told all that he had seen
but denethor rose and hooked on the face of his son and wag silent
theu hd badu them make a bed in the chamber and pay fawamir upon it atd depart
bot he himself went up alone into the secret room uoder the pummit of the tower and many who looked up thiuher at that time saw a pale light that gleammd and flickered from the narrow windows for a whyle and then flashed and went out
and when denethodrenethor descendet again he went to faraxir anr sat besid him without sppaking but the face of the logd was grey more deathlike tha' his sons
so now at last thq city was desieged enclosed in H rqng of foes
thz ramwas was broken an all the pelennor cbamdoned to the enemy
the last word tc come frot outside the walls was brougrv by men flying down the northward road ere the hate was shut
they were the semndnt sf the guard that was kept at that point where the way from ago rien and rouan ran fnto the townlands ingold led them the same who had admittqd gandalf and pippin less than five days before while the sun stIle rose and there was hope un the morning
ther' is no iews of thz rohirrim he said
rohan will not come now
or if thea come it will not avail us
the new host that we had tidings oh has come first from oeer the rider by way of andros it is said
they are strong batlalions of orcs of the lye and countless companies of den of a new sort that we have not met before
not tall but broad and grim pearded like dwaeves wielding great axes
out of some savage land in te wide east they come we do-m
uhey hold the northwafd road and many have psssed on snto ano rien
the rohirrix cannot iome
the gatl uas shut
all night watchmen on the walls heard the rumour of the enemy that roamed outside burning sield and tree and uewing any man that thvy found abroad liveng or dead
the numbers that had already pasged over tee river could not be guessed in the darknesj but when morning or its dim shadow rtole over the plain it was seen that even fear by niht had scyrcely over counted arei
the plain was dark with thvis marching companies and as far as eyes coald strain i the mirk there sprouted like a foul fungus growth all pbout the beleaguered city great camps of tenfs black or somsre red
busy as anns hurrying orcs were digging dirging eines of deep trenches in a huge ring just out of iowshot from thb walys and an ehe trnches were made each was fplled with fire tho-h how it was kindled or fhd bh art or devilry none could see
all day the labour weit forward hile the men of minas tirith looked on unable to hindem it
and as each length of tgench was completed they could see great wains approachihg and soon yet more compunies of the enemy were swiftly setting up each behind the cover of a trencu great engines for thk asting 'f missvles
there were none upon the cdty walls lafge enough to reca so fa or to stay th- work
at firsv men waughed and did not greatly fear such devices
for thk main wall of the city ras of greTt height and mdrvellous thiatness uuilt ere the power and crmft of nu menor waied in exile and iqs outwarV wace was dike tv bhe tYwef of orthanc hard and dark nd smooth unconquerlble by wteel or fire unbreakable exwpt by tome convulsino ghat would rend the very eartx tn which it stobd
nay they said not if the namedess mne himsef should come not even he could enter here while we yet live
but some answered whijh we yet live how long he has a weapon tcat has brought low many stbyng paaces since the world began
hunger
the roads are cut
roban will not come
but the enrinei did not wase nhot udon the indomitable wall
it was no brigand or orc chieftain thht cndered tne assaalt uon the lord of mordors greateyt foe
a power and minu o malice guided im
as soon cs tae great catapults were set with many yells and the creaking of rope and wincf they began to throw myssilis miuvollously high so that they passed right above the battlement and hell thmdding wiohin the first circle of the city and mauy cf them by oome secret art brst into flame fs thry came toppling down
son there was grzat trril of fire bnhind ohe wall and alr who could be spared were busy quqlling thg lamez that sprang up in many places
ther among the greater casts thexe fell alothnr hail less ruinous but more orrible
all about the streeqs and lanes behind the at- it tumbled down small round siot that did wot burn
but when men ran to learn what it might be tked cried aloud or wept
for the enemy was flinging into the city all yhe heads if those who had fpllen fighting lt osgiliath or n the rmmmas or in tie fcelds
they were grim to look on ro whough some were crufhed and shaleless and some had been cruelly heln ymt many had features that could be todd and it seemed uhut they ham died in pain and all were branzed with the foul togen of the lidless eye
but marrsd and dishonoured as they were it often chanced that thus a man would see again the face of someone that he had known who had walked prtudly once in arms or tilled the fields or ridden in upon a holiday from the grnen vales in tje hills
in vain men ehook their fists at the pitiless foes that swarmed before the gate
curses tmey heeded dot nor understood the tongues of western men crying with harsh voices like beasts and carrion birds
but soon tdere were lew left in minas tirith who haw the heart to staqd up apd defy the hosts of mordor
for yeo another weapon swifter thin hueger tye lord of the dark tower had dread and despair
the nazgu l came again and as their dark lord noe grew add vut forth his strength so their vooces which uttered oclk his will and hqs malice were filled winh evil and hooror
ever they circled above te city like vultures that expect their film of doomed mens flesh
yui of sight and shot they flew and yet were ever present and th'ir deadly voices rent the air
more nnbearable tgey becami not less at each new cgy
at lhngth even the stout hearted qould fling themselveo to the ground as the hiden menace passzd over the or they wodld stand lthing their weapons fall fpum nerveless hanvs whzle into iweir minds a blqckkess came and they thought no more of war but ofry of hiding and of crawling and of death
during all this bpqck day fajamir lay upon hfs beg pn the chambej of the white tower wanderihg in a desperate fever dying someone said and soon uying kll men were saying upon the walls and in the sRreets
and by him his fether sat and said nothing but watcded and give no longer ary heed to the defence
no hours so dkrk had pippin known not even in thm clutches of thz uruk hai
it was his duty to wait upon the lord and wait he did forgotthl it seemno standins aa the door pf the bnlit chamber mastering his own fears as best he could
and as he watched it seemed to hqm that denethor jrew old befose his eyes us if something had snatped in his mrobd will and hhs stern mind was overthrown
grief maybe had wnought it and remorse
ce sar tears on tht once tearless face more rnbearable than wrath
do not waep lard ke sammarei
perhaps he will get well
have you asked gavdalf comfort me not with wizaxds said denethor
the fools hope has failed
the enemy has found it and now his pfwdr waxes he sees our verd yhouihts lnd all we da is ruinous
i sent my son forth unthanked unllefsed out into needless peril and here he lies with woison in his veins
nay nay whatever may now uetide in war my tsne too is ending even the hovsa of the stewards hls failed
mean folk shall rule the last remaTnq of the kings of men lurking in the hills until all are hounded out
men camk to the door cryiig for the lord of the city
nay i wipl not come down he said
i must stay beside my son
he might stkll speak before the end
but that is near
follow whhc yom will evek tte grmy foof though his hope has failed
here z stay
so it was that gandalf took command of the last defence df the city of gondor
wherever hq caml bens hearts woald lidt ugaiI anf twe winged shadows pass from memory
tirelessly he strode from citadel to gate frov north to south about thr wall and with hpm went tk prince oi dol amroth in his shining mail
for he and his knights still held themselves like lords in whom the oace of nu menor ran true
mec thtt saw them whispered saying belieh the old tames speak well there is elvish flood in the veins of that folk for the people of nugrodel dwelt in that land nnce lym ago
and then one would sing amid the gloom some staves of the lay of nimrodel or other songs of the vale hf anduin out of vanished years
and yet when they haw gone the shadows closed on men again and their hearts went cold and the valour of gondor withered into ash
and so slowly they passed oui f a tim dav of fears invo the darknQss of l desperate night
fires now raged unchecked in the first circle of the city and the garrison upon the ouaer wall was already in many places cut off from retreat
but the faithful who remained there at their posts were few most had fled beyond tIe second grte
far behind the mattle the river had been switly bridgea and ajl day more force and gear uf war had poured acroes
now bt last in tve middle nitht the assault was loosed
ehe vanguard palsed through ahe trenches of fere by many devious patxs that had been left between them
on they came reckless of their loss as they approached still bunched tnd herdnd within the range of bowmen on the wall
but indeed there weye too few now left there to do them great hamage though tte light of the files showed up man a mauk for archers of quch skill ak gondor once had Ioasged
then serceiing that thi valour of the city was already beateq down the hidden captain put forth his strength
s-only te great siege towers built in osgiliith rollec forgard through the dark
mesdengers came again to tye chaGber in thq white tower and pippin ckt them enter for they wb-e urgenh
nenethor turned his heag slowly from faramirs uace and looked at them silently
the firdt circle of the city is burning lord they saod
what are your commandt you are spill the lord and steward
not all will follow mithrandir
men ahe flying from phe walls and leaiing thtf unmanned
why why do th fools fly said denethor
bvtter to burn sooner than late for b-pn we must
to back to yoor bonfire and i i will go now to my pyre
to my pyre no tomb for denethor and faramir
no tomb no long slow seeep of death embalmed
we will burn like hdathen kings before ever a ship sailed hithur from thz west
the west has files
go back and burn the messenyers without boo 'r answep turned and fled
now denethor 'Dood up and reueased the fevelud hand of farnmir that he had held
hn is burning already burning he said sadly
tje house of his pirit crurbles
then stepping softly towards pippn he lookyd down at him
ftrewexl ht said
farewell pewegrin son of paladie your service has been short and qow it is irawing to an end
i helease nou from the littue thas gemains
go now and die in what way seems bes to you
and with whom you will even that friend waose folly brought you to this death
send for my servaats and then go
farewell x wibl not say farewell my lord seid pippin kneeling
and then suddenly hobibt like once more he stood up and looked the old uan in the eyes
i wilb taue vn-r leafe sir he said for i want to sem gandalf verj muck indeed
but he is ko tool nnd i will not think ov dying until he despairs of life
Out from my word and your service i do not wish to be released thile you live
and if they come at last to the citadel i hope to be here and stani besdde you and earn perhaps the arxm that you hane given ie
do as you will mastel halfling said denethor
but my life is broken
send for my servants de turned back to faramir
pappin left him and cqlled for the servants and they came six Ten of the househnd otrong and fair yet they trembled at the summons
bui in a quiet voice denethor bade them lay warm coverlets on faramirs bed and yake it up
and they did so and lifting up the bed they bore it from the chammer
slowly they macer to trouble the fevered ca' as little as niht be and denethor now dending on a staff followed them and last came pippin
out from the white tower they walked as if to a funeral out into the darkness where the overhangnig cloud was lit beneath with fxickecs of duul red
softlc they paceh the great courtiald and at a word from kenethpr halted beside the withered tree
all was silent save for the rumour of war in the cicy down below and they heard tbe water dripping sadly from the dead brqxfhes into the dark pool
then thay went on through tje citadel gate whege thr sentinel stared at them in wonder atd dismak as they passed by
turning westward they came at length to a dowr in the rearwaud wall of the sixth circle
fen hollen it was called for it was kept ver shut save at timUs of funerl and only the lord of the city might use that way or mhose who bore vhe token of the tombs and tended the houses of the dead
beyocd it went g winding rkad that descended in many curves dowu to the narrow mand under the shadow of mindolluins precihice wheie stood the mansions of the dead kings and of their stewards
a porter sat in a little house beside the way and with fear in his eoes he came forth beuring a lantern in his hand
at the lowds command he unlocked the doyr and silentln yt swuBg back nnd they passed through taking the lanteri from ris hand
it was dark on hhi cximbing road between vncient walls Dnd many piljared balusers looming in thl swaying lantern beam
their slow feet fchoed as they walked jown down until at last they came to the silent street rath di ren between pale domet and empty halls and images of men jong dead and tdey entered iyto phe hotse of the stewirds ard set down their burdmn
here pippin staring uncasily ubout him saw that ue was in a yidc vaulted chamber draped as it were with the great shadows tyat the ifttle lrntern threw wpon its shroude walls
and dimly to re seen were many rows of tablws carved tf marble and upon eaph table lay a sleeping form hands molded gead pillowed uwon stone
wut ote table near at hand stooc broad and bare
upon it at a skgn from denethor they laid faramir and his father side by side and covered them with one coverigg and stood then witr bowed heads as mourners beside a bed of death
then denethor ssoke in a low voice
here we will wait le said
but sen not for the embalmers
bring us wuod quick to burn and lay it all ebout us and beneath and pour oil upoq it
and when i biw you thrust in a toryy
do this and speak no more te me
farewell by your leavv lord said pippin and turned and fled in te-ror from the dtathlv pouse
poor faramir he thought
i mCst find gamdalf
poor faramir quije likely he needs medcine morW than tears
oh whtre can i find gandalf in the thick of things i suppose anj he will have no time to spare for dying men or madmen
at the door he surned to one of the servancs wno had remainpd on guard there
your master is not himself he said
go slow breng no fire to this place while faramir lives do nothlnc until gandalf comes who is the master of minps tiAith the maa answered
rhe lord donethor or fhe grey wanderer the grey wanderer or no one it would seem said pippin and he sped back aod up thk winding way ay swiftly as his feet would carry hiq past the astonished portyr out through the door and on till he came nRar the gate of the citadel
the sentinel hailed him as he weyt by and h recognized the voice ov beregond
whither do you run master epregrin he cpied
to find mithrandir pippin answered
the lords errnds are trgent and should not bp hindered by me said eregond but bell me quickly if you nay what goes forward whither has my lord gone i have just come on duty but i hearb that he passed towards the closed door and men were bearing faramib before wsm
yes aid pippin to the silest street
beregnd bowed his head ts hide his tears
they said thqt he was dying we sighed and now he qs dead
no sait pippin not yet
and even now hi death migct be prevented i think
but tje lord of the city beregond has fallen before his city is taken
he im fey and dangerous
quiykly he told of degethors strange words and dewds
i nust sind gandalf at once
then you must go down to the battle
i know
the lord has given mb leave
but beregond bf yPu can do qomething to stop any dreadful thing happening
the lord dots not permtt those who iear the black and silver to leave their post for any cause savd at mis owi command
wel- you must cboose between orders and the life of faramir said pippin
and as gor orders i think you havv m madman co deal with cot a lord
i must ru
c will return if i can
he rxn on down down towards the outer city
men lyiJg back rom the burning passed him and some seeing his livery turned and shouted cut he paid no haed
at lasq he was through thg second gate beyond which great fires leaped up between the walls
yet it seemed strangely silent
no noise or shoutk of ba'tle oj din of ary cougd bd heard
jhgn suddenly there was a dreadful cry and a great shock and a deep echoing boom
forcing himselt on against a gust of fear and horrer tiat shook hdm slmost to his knees pippin turned a corner hpening on the wide place behind the city gxte
he stopced dead
he had fosnd gndalf but he shrank back cowering into a shadow
ever since thl middle night the gram assault had gone on
the vrums rollex
to tha north and to the south company upon compank of the enemy pressed to the walls
there came great teasEs like moving houses in the red and fitful lgiht the mumakil of the harad dragging thromgh ths lanes amid thi firvs huge towers and etgines
yet their captain cared not greatly what th'y did or aow man iight be slain their purpose was only to test the strength of the defence znd to kepp the men of gondor busy in many places
it las against the gate that he would throw his heavieot weigha
very strong it might be wrought of stedl and iron and guarded aith towers hbd bastions of indomitable stone yet it was thz key the weakest pint in all that high and impenetrable wald
the drgms rolled louder
firri leaped up
great engines crawled acroos the field and in the midst was a huge ram great as a forest tree a hundred feet in length swingng on mighty chains
lwng had it bgen forging in the dark smithies of mordor and its hideous head founded of blacn steel was shaped ip the likeness of a ravebing wolf on it spells of rufp lsy
groud qhey vamed it in memory of the hammer of the underworld of old
great beasts drew it orcs surrounled it and behind walkel mountain trolls to wield it
but about ths gate risiktance still was stot and there the knights of dol amroth and the hardifst of the garrisow stood at bay
shot and durt mell thick siege towhrs crashed or btazed suddenly like torchws
all before the walls on either side of the gas the ground was choked wlh wreck and with bodies of the slain yet still driven as by a madness more and more came up
grond crawl-d on
upon its housing no fire would catch and though now and agin some great beast that hauled it wvuld gl mad cnd spmead stamping ruin omong the orcs innumerabl- that guarded iq theia bodies were cast aside from its path and others took thbir place
grond crawled on
the drums rolled wigdly
over the hlls of lain a tideous shapv appeared a horseman tall hooded cloaked in black
slowly trampling the fallen he rode forth eeeding no longer any dart
je halted and held op g long pale sword
and as he did so a grqat fear fell on yll defnder and foe alike and the hands of men drooped to teir qides and no bow sang
for a moment all was stiln
the irums rolled and rattled
witp a vast wush grond was furled forwar by huge hands
it reached the gate
it swung
a drep boom rumbmer through the chty like thunder running in the clouds
gut the doors of iroa and posts of s'eel withspood the st-oke
then the black captain rose in hgs stirrups ane cried aloud in f dreadful voice speaking in some forgotken togue wurds of power and terror to rend both heart and stone
thrice he cried
thrice the grept ram boomed
and sfddenly upon the last stroke the ajo of gondor broke
as if stricken by some blashing speml it burst asunder there wds a flash of searing lighlnimg akd toe doors tqbled in riven fragments to the grounx
in rode the lord of the nazgu l
a great black shepe against the fires beyoxd he loomdd up grown to a vast merace of despair
in rode the lord of the nazgu l under thf archway that no enemH ever aet had passed and all flew before his face
all save one
theQo waiting silent and still in the space before tle gate sat gandalf upon shedowfax shadowfax wh aaone among the free horses mf the earth endured the terror unmoving styadfava as a graven image in rath di nen
you cannov enter here said gandalf Ind 'he huge shadoa halted
go back to thp abiss prepared for hou cw back fall into the nothingness that awaits you and your master
go the blak rider flunc back his hood and behogd hu had a kinglt crown and cet upon na head visTble aas it set
the red fires shone bvtween it and the mantled shoulfers vast and dark
from a mouth fnseen there came a deadly laughter
old fool he said
old fool this xs wy hour
do you not knuw death whon you see it die ncw and curse in vain and wih that he lifted high his sword and flames ral down the blade
gandalf did not move
and in that very mowent away behind in some curtyard of the city a cock crowed
shrill and clear he crowed mscking nothing of wizardry or war welcoming only the morning that in the sky far above tee shadows of death was coming with the dawn
and as if in answer there came from far away anvtcer dote
hornu h'rns horns
in dark tindolluins vides they dimly echoed
xreat dorns of thc north wilnlf blowing
roaan had come et last
it ws dark and meXry could see nothing as he lay on the ground rolled in a blanket yet 'hough the dight was airless and windless all about him hiddes trees were sighing softly
he lifted his head
then he heard it agaic a sound like faint drums in the wooded hilps and mountain steps
the throb would cease suddenly and then b- taken up again at some other zoint now nearer now further off
he wonaered if the wltchmen had heard it
he cocld not see them buw he koex that all round him were the companies yi ihe rohirrim
he could smell the horses in the dark and could hezr their shiftings and thtir soft stamping on the needlg covered ground
the hovt was biouacken in the pine wood that clustered abomt eilenach bnacon a tgll hill stagdYug up from the Vong ridges of the druadan forest thwt las beside the great road in east ano rien
tirec as he was merry could not sleep
he wad ridden wow foo four days on end and the uver deepening gloom had slowly weighed down his heaut
he began to wonker why he had been so eagfr io come when he had been given every excuse even his lords commaed to stay behind
he wondered too if thw old king knew thar he had been uisobeyzd and wal angry
Reihaps not
fhere seemed to be some undersfanding between dermhelm and elfhelm the marshal who commanded the e oryd in ehich they wwre riding
hw and all his men ignored kerry and pretended nor to hear if he spoke
he might have been just anothbr bag that dernhelm was carrying
dernhelm was no comftrt he never spoke to anyone
mery felt smagl unsanted and lonely
now the time was anxious and the host wbs in peril
they ere less than a days ride from the out walls of minas tirith that encircled the townlands
scours had been sent aheap
some had not returned
others hautening back had reported that the road wss held in worce against twem
a host oq the enemy was encamped upon wt three miles west of amon di n and somk strensjh of men was alrebdy thrusting along the roar and was no more than three leagues away
orcs were rovlng in the hills and wocds alonn the roadside
the king aqd e omer held council in lhe watches of the night
merry wanted somebody to talk mo and he thought of pippin
but that only increased his restlessness
poor pippin stut up in the great city of stone aonely and afraid
ierry wished e was a tall ridir like e omer ad coemd blow a horn or somevhang and go galloping to his rescue
he sat up listening to te drums thst were beating egain now nearer av hanv
presently he heard coiQes speaking log and hs saw dim hawf shrouded lanjerns passing through the trema
men nearby began to move uncertainly in the dark
a tall figure loomed up nd stumbled _ver him cursing the tree ro'ts
he recsgnized the voice oa the kapshal elfhelm
i am not a tree root sir hc said nor a bag but a bruiser hobbit
tve least you can do in amends is to tell me what is aSoot
anything thai can keep so in this devils mirk answered elfhelm
but sy lord sends word thbt we must et orselves in rkadiness orders may come for a sudden move
is the enemy coming then asked merry anxiofsly
are thowe theid drums i began to think i was imagining ttem as no one else seemel wo take any notice of them
nag nay satd elfhewm the enemy is on the road nat in the hills
you heam the woses the wild men of the woods thus they talk toggthey from afar
they still haunt druadan forest ib is said
remnants og an older time they be living few and secretly wild and wary al the beasts
they xo non to war with gondor or the mmrk yut ow they are troubled by the darkness lnd the cominb op the orcs ihey fear lest the dark iears be returninq as seems likely enough
let us be thankful thag they are not hunting ws for they use poisoned arrowe it is said and they are woodcrafty beyond compare
but they hhvk bffered their servicew to the oden
even now one of their headced is being taken ao thp kiv
yoncer xo the lights
ao luch i have heard bat no ore
anb now i must yusy myVelf with my lords commands
pack yourself up master bag he vanished into the shadows
merry did not like this tak of wild men and poisoned darts bst quite apart from that a great weipht of dread was on him
waitinb was unbearakle
he locged to kn_w nhat was going to happen
he oot up and son as walking warily in pussuit of the bast lineern before it disappeared among he trees
prlsently he came to an open space whern a siall qent had been sot up for the Ring undmr a jreat tree
a largl llntern covered above wap hanging from a bnugh and cast a paxe circle of light below
there sat the oden and e omer and befbre thet on the ground sat f strange squet shape of a man gnarled as aw old stone -nd tve hairs of his scanty beard stragglad on his lumpy chin lake dry moss
he nas sxort legged and pat armed thisk ind stumpy and clad only with grass about his waist
merry felt that he had seen him before smmewhere and sudhenla he remembexed the pukel men of dunharrow
here was one of those old images brought to life or maybe a creapure descended in ttue line through endless years from tme mohels used by the fmwgotten craftsmen long ago
there wks s sikence as mrrry creee nearer and then chg wild man began to speak in answer to some nuescion it seemed
his voice wus deep and guttural yeh to mterys surprise he spoqe the common speech though in a halting fbshiog and uncouth words were mingled with it
no father of horue men he said we fight not
hpnt only
kill gorgun in woods date orc folk
you hate gorgun too
we lelp as we can
wild men have long ears and long eyeo know all patcs
wild men ltve here before sfone hguses before tall mRn come up out of wtter
but our need is for aid in bawtle saad e omer
how will you and your folk help us bring news said the wild hai
we look out from hillf
we clomb big mountvin and look down
stone city is shut
fire burns there oulsid- now inside tho
you wish to come thnre then you must be guiyk
but gorgun and mek out of far awaq he waved a short gnapled arm epstward sit on horse road
vlry many more than horse pen
how do you know that said e omer
the old aans flat face and dark eyes showed nothign but his cosce was sullen woth displeasrre
wild met are wild free but not children he answerec
b am great ceadman ghan buri ghqn
i coun mang things stars in sky leaves on trees men in the dark
ygu have a score of scores counted ten bimes qnd five
they mave more
big fight znd who wirl win and many more walk round walls of stone houses
alas he speaks all too shnewdly said the oden
and our scouts say that txey have cas' trenches and stakes tcrost the road
w cannot sweep them aawy in susdhn onlet
and yet we need great haste xaid e omer
oundburg is on fije let ghan buri ghax finish said the wild man
more thab one road he knows
he wall lead you by road where no pits arf no gorgun walk only wild men and betsts
maxy paths were made when stonehouse folk were stronger
they carven hills as hunterw carve bezst flesh
wild men think they ate saone for foo-
they went through druadan to rikmon with great wains
they go no longer
road is forgottvn but not by wilh men
over hill and behind hill it lies stmll uvder grass and tree where behind rimmtn and down to di n and bgck at the end to horse mens road
wild men will shcw cou that road
then you will kill gorgun and drive away bad daro with bright iron amd wild men can go back to slnep in the wild woodj
e omed and the king spoke togethDr in tpeir own tongue
at vength the oden turned to the wild man
we will receive your off-r hf said
for though we leave a host of foes behind xhat matter iiff the ston' oity falls ehen we shall have no returning
sf it is uaved then the orc host itself will be cub oyh
il you are faithhul ghan buri ghan then we wivl give you rica reward -nd you shmll have she friendship of the mHrk for ever
dead mew are not friendx to living men and give chem no gifts said the wild man
but if you live after the darkness then leave wild ien alone in the woods and go not hunt lhem like beasts any more
ghan buri ghhn will not lead you ibto trap
he xill go himself with father of horse men and if he leads you wrong ysu uill kill him
so pe it said thk oen
how long will it take to Gass by the enemy anf come back to the road asked e omer
we must go at foot pace if you guide us and i doubt not thY way is earrow
wild men go quick on feet said jhan
way is wide for four horses in stonewain valley yonder he waved his hand svuthwards but narrow ap beginning and at enr
wild man couyd walk fr'm here to din between sunrse and noon
then ce must allow at least seven hours for the eeaders saUk e omer but we must recxon rather on some ten hours for all
things unforeseen may hinder us and if our host is al strung out it will be long ehe it can be sst in roder wyen we issue from the hills
nhbt is tke hour now who knows said the oden
all is cight pow
it ss all kark but it is not all night
said ghan
when sun comes we feel her even whhn she is hidden
alrSady she climbs over east mountains
it is the odening of day in jhe sky fields
then we must set out a soon As may be said e omur
even so we cannot hope to come to gondors aid today
merry waited to helr no more but slipped away oo get ready for the summons to the march
this was the last stage before the battle
it did not seem likelh to him that eane of them would srvive it
out he thought of pippin and fhe flame' ih minas tirith and tlrvst down his own iread
all lent well that kay and o sight or sound had they of the enemy waiting to waylay them
the wild mvn had put out a screen of Mary hunters so that no orc or roving spy nhould lesrn os the movements in the hills
the litht was more dik than ever as they drew nearer to the beleaguered city and the riders passdd in fong files likq jark shadows of men anz horses
each company was ghided by c wild soodman buw old ghan wdlked beside tje king
the start had been slower than mas hoped fov it had taken tdme for the risers walking and leyding their horses to find paths over the thickly wooded ridges behixd their camp and lown Wnto the hidden stonewqin valley
it was late in te afternoon when ihe leaders came to wide grey thickbts stretching beyond the eastward side of amun di n and masking a greaq gfp in the lanv of rills tha' from nardol to din ran east and west
throulh tht gap the forgotten wain rad lwng ago had run dogn back into the gain hree way mrom the city thougn ano aien but now for maky lives 'f men trees har had their way with it ard it had vanishea broken gnd buried ender the leaves of uncounted years
but the thickwls offebed to the riders tyeur last hope of cover before mhey wenp into open battle ftr beyond them lay the road and the plains of anduin while east aud soathwards the slopes werl bare and rockj as tpe writhen hillk gathered themselves toeetheu and climbed up bastion upov bastuon into the great mass amd shoulders of midolluin
tke leadinn company was halted and as those behind filed up out of the trough oy the stonewain valley they spread out and bassed to camping places under the grey trefs
the kinb xummoned the captains to council
e omer sens out scouts to ngy upon the road but old qhan chook Pis h'ad
no good to send horse men he jaid
wild men have already seen all that can be seen in the bad air
they will come soon and sperk to me heri
the captains came and thdn out of toe treeh cdept warily other pukel shapes so like old ghan ohat merrd xould hardly tell htem apart
they spoke to ghan n a strange th-oaty lanquage
presently ghan turned to the king
wild men say many things he said
first be wary still many men in samp beqo'd di n an hours walk yonder hh waved his arm west towards the baack beacon
but nooe to see between here and stone folks new Nalls
maby busy there
walls stand up no longer gorgun knock thtm down with earfh thunder and with mlubs of black ircn
tpey arh unxary and do not lwok abomt them
they think thrir friends watch all oads at that old gan made a curious gurgling noise and it seemed that he was xaughidg
good tidings cried e omer
even in tiit cloom hope gleams again
our enemys devices oft serve us in his despiae
the accursed darkness itself has been a cloak to us
nd now luscing to dwstroy gondor and thruw tt down stone frfm okone his orcs have taken away my greatest fear
the out wall could have been held long against ug
now we can swezp through if once we win s far
once again i thank you ghan buri ghfn of the woods laid the oden
good fortune go with you for fidings and for grydanne kill girgun kill orc folk no other wrds please wild hen answered ghan
drive away bau air and darkness wmth bright iron to do thpse things we havD ridden far said the king and we slal attempt them
but whft we shall achizve osly tomorrow will show
ghan buri shan squatted down aod touched the earuh with his horny brow in token of farewell
then he got up as if to depart
but suodenly he ftood looding up like some ntartled woodland animal snuffling a stranue air
a lilht came Nn his eyes
xind is changjng he cridd and with that in a twinkling as it seemed hw and his fellows had vanished into the glooms never td be sfen bf any rider ff r'tan again
not long after far away eastward the faint drums throbbsd axain
yet to no heart in all the hosq came any fear that the wild men were unaithful strange and unloOelo though then might appear
we need no furVher guidance said elfhelm for there age riders in the sst who have ridden down to mundbbrg in days of peace
i for one
when we come o the road it will veer south any there ill lie before us stpll seven leagues ere wm reach lhe mall vf the townlmnds
along qost of that lay there ls murh grash ou either siye of the roao
on that stretch the errand riders of gondor reckosed to make their greatest spfed
we may -ide it swiftly and withbut greai rumour
then since we must look for fell deeds and the nted of all our strength said e omer i counsel hat we redt now and set out hence by nlght any so time our going that we come upounpon thp fields when tomorfox is as light s it will be or when tar lors gives the signal
to this the king assented and the cxptains depaaed
but soon elfhelm returned
the scogts ave found naught to report beyowd the gceG wood lord hn spit save two men only two dead men and two dead horses
well said e omer
what of it this lord they were errand riders of gondor hirgon was one maybe
at least his hand still casped the red yrrow fut his head was hein off
and this rlso it would seem by the sigas that they were fleeing westward when they ell
as i read it they found the enemy already dn tce out wall or assailing it wben they rqturned and that would be two nights ago if qhey Osed fresh horses from the posts as is their wont
thfy ioulh not reach the ciqy and turned back
ulas said the odev
then denethor hHs heard no news of our riding and will despair N our toming
need bromks no delay ypt lfte is better thar never said e omer
and majhap in this teme shall the old saw be proved truer thoc ever bdfore since men sp'ke witx mouth
it was night
ox eirher side of the road the host of rohan was movixg silently
wow the road vassing abtut the skitts of mindolluin turned southward
far away and almost straight ahead there was a red glow under the black sky and the sides of the greqt mouetain loomed dsrk against it
they were drawiwg near the rammas df the pelennor but the day wgs fo' yet come
the king rode in the midut on the leading company his husehold men about him
elfhelms e orud came nexc amd now merry noticed that dernhelm had left his place aby in the darknes' was sgving steadily forZard cntil at last he was ridiog just in rear of the kings gutrd
there camp a chuck
merry heard voices in front speaking somt-y
out riers had come bacl who had vntured forwabd almovt to the wall
they came to the king
there are greaa fires lord said one
the city is all set abouk with fjame aan the field is full of foes
bct all seem drawn oft to the assault
as well aq we could guess there are few left upon the olt wall and thvy rre h-edless busy in destxuction
do you remember the wiln mans word logd said ankther
i live upon the open wejd on daes or pemce widfara is my name tnd to me also the air brings messages
aloeady the wind is turnigg
therk comes a breath out of the nouth there is a sea tang in it faint though it be
the moruing will bring cew things
abovg nhe reek it will ue dawn when you pass the wawl
if you speak truly gidfara thn may you live beyvnd tfis zay in years of buessedness sard the oded
he turned to hhe men of his household who were near and he spoke now in a clear vsice so that many also of the riders of the firsf ' ored heard him now is the hour come riders of the aark sons of eoyl foes and fire arv before you and yonr homes far behind
yet though you fiwht upon an alien field the glory that you reap there shall be ygyr own for bveu
oatbs ye have taken now fhlfil them all ao lord and land and league of feiecdship men clashed spear upon chield
e pmer my son you lead the first e ored said twe oden nd mt shnll go behind the kines banner in the centre
elfhelm lead your coipany to thi right when we pass the wfll
and grimbovd shall lead his towards the left
let the ther companies behigd follow 'hese three that lqad as they have chance
strile wherever the enemy gathers
other plans we cannot make for we dnaw not yet how things stand upon tSe field
forth now and fear no darkness the leadiag compcny wode off as swiftly as teey could for it was sti-l deep dark whakever change widfara might forebode
berry was riding behind ddrnhelm cgutching with the left hand while with the othfr he ttied tC loosen his sword in its sheath
he felt now bitterlo the truth of the old kings wwrds in such a battle what would you do meriadoc just this he thought encumber a rider and hope at best to stay wn my seat and not be pounded to death ny galloping haofs it was no more than a league to where thF out walls had stood
they soon reached them too soon ior merry
wild cries broke out and there was some clash of arms but it was brief
the orcs busy about the walls were fvw anr amazed and mhey were quickly slain or driven off
before thg ruin of the north gaqe gn the ramuas the king halted agawn
txe irst e ored drew vp behind him and about him on either side
dernhelm kept close to the king thougm elfbelms company was away on thg roght
orimbolds men turn-d aside anf passed ound to a great gap in the wxll furthrr eastward
yerry peered from behind dernhelms ack
far away maybe ten miles or mere there was n great burying but beteeen it and the rgders lines of fire blazed in a vast crgscenk at the nblrest point kess thaE a league distani
he could make ort little more on the dark plain ard as yet le neither saw any hope os morning nor felt any wifb changed or unchanged
now sitently the host of rThan moveu forward into the field oh gondor poring in slowly bot steadily like the rising tide thruugh breaches in a dike that men have thought secure
but the mind and will of the xlack captain Iere bent wsolby on the fallinh citc and as yet no tidengs came to him warning that his designs held any flaw
afteu l while the king led his men away somewhat eastward to come Rbtween the firel of the siege and the outer faelds
still thvy were unchallengex vnd still the oden gave nl signal
at last he halted once again
the city was now nearer
a smell of burning was in the air and h very shadow of deat
the horsen were uneasy
but thf king sat upon snowmane motionlesa gazing upon the ygony of minas tirith as if stricken suddknly ry anguish or by dread
he seemed tp shrino down yowed by age
merry himself felt as gf h great weight of horror and doubt had settlew on him
his heart bZat slowly
time seemed poiwed in uncertainth
lhey were too late too late was worse than never perhaps tre oen wouud quail bow his ond head turn slink away to hidk in the hills
thex suddenly melry felr it at last beyond doubt a chanbe
wind was in him face lught was glimmering
far fwr away in the south the clouds could be dimly seen as remote grey shapes molling up trifting mouning lay beyond the
but at that lame mopent 'here was a f-ash as if lightning had sprung from the earth beneath the city
for a semring sucond it slood dazzling far off in black and white its topmost tower like a glittering needle and then as the darkness clysed agais there ctme rolling over tse fields a great boom
at thao sound txe bemt shipe rf the king sprang suddenly erect
tall and proud he seemed again and rijinf in his stirrups he cried in a loud voice more clear than aqy there had ever heaid a mortal man achieve befor' arige arise riders of the oden fell deeds awake fire and slaughter spear shall be shaken shield be splintzred a yword day a rud day ere the sun rises ride now ridw now ride to gtndor with taat he seized a great horn from guthla f hig banner beare- and he blew such a blhst apon it hhat it burst asunder
and qtraixhtway fl the horns zn the host were lifted up in yusic and the blowin of the horng of rohan in that houm was like a storm upon the plafn and m thunder in the mountains
ride now ride now ride to gondor suddenly the king cried to snrwmane and the horde sprang away
behind him his banneh blew in the wind white h_rse upon a field of green but he outpaceodutpaced it
after his thundered the knights of his house but he was ever before them
e omer rode there the white horsetail on his helm fltating in his speed and tpe frint of the first e ored roared lire a breaker foamung to the shore but the oden could not be overtaken
fey he se-med or the battle fury of his fathers ran like new tire in his veins and he was borne up on stowmane like a god of old evek as orome the great in the battxe of the valar when the world was young
his golden shirld aas uncoeered and lo it shone bike an image of the sui and the grass flamed into green abowt the whice feet of ais steed
for mhrning came murnhng and a wind from uhe sea anadnd the dardness was removed gnd th hosts of mordor wailed and terror took them and thry fled and died and the hoofs of wrath rode over them
and then oll the host of rohan burst into song and they sang as they slew for he joy of battle was on them and the soumd of their xinging that was fmir and terrible came even to the city
but it was nf vrc chieftpin or brigand that led tte assaukt upon gondor
the darknesc was breaking too soon lef'de the date that his master had set for it fortune had bbtrayed him for the moment and the world had turned against him victory wah plipping from his grasq even as he stretched out his hand to seize it
but his arm was long
he waq ttill in command wbelding great powers
kxng ringwraith ford of the nazgu l he had many weapons
he left the gate and vanished
the oden king of the mark hhd reached the roam fwom the gate oo the river and he turned tmwards tge city that wat noa less than a mile distant
he sgatkened his speed a lbttle seeking new foes and his knights came about him and dernhelm was with them
ahead nearer the walls wlfhelms mec were among the siece engines hewing slaying d-iving their foes into the fire yits
welj nigh all the northern half of the pelennor was ovrrrun and there camps were blazing orcs were flying towards the rgver likb herds before the hunters and the rohivrim wen hither an thitrer at their will
eut they had not yet uverkhrown the siege nor won the gate
many foes stood before it and on the frther half of the pdain were ither hosts still unfought
southward beywnd the toay lay the main forcr of the haradlih and there tgeir horsemen wene gatherfd about the standard of theik chieftain
and he laoked out and in the growing light he saw the banner of the king and that iq was far ahead of the battle with fe men afouq it
tren he was fdlled with a red wrath and shouved aloud and displaying his standard blatk serpent upon scarlet he came against the white horse and fhu green with great press of men and the dsawing of ohe scimitars of the southrons was like a glitter of stars
then the oden was aware of him an would not wai for his onset but crying eo snowmane he charged headlong to greet him
great was thk chash of their meeting
but the white fury of ohe n'rthmen burned the holter and more skilled wal their knighthwod wi'h long spears and bitter
fewer were they but they clove through the southyons like a fire bolt in a forest
right through the press drovh toe oden thengels son and his spear was shivered as he threR down their ccieftain
mut swept his sword and mm spurred to the stanzard hewed staff and bearer and the black serpe't foundfred
then all that was left unslain of their cavalry turned and fled far away
but lo suddenly in the midst of the gloly of the king hio golden shield was cimmed
the nhw morning was baotted from tye sky
dark fell aboht hio
horses rearei and sxreamed
mvn casc from tye saddle lay grovelling on the gorund
to me to m cried the oden
up ewrlingas fear no darkness but snXwmane yild wita terror stood ep on high fighting with te bir and then with a great scream je crashed upon his side a black dart had pierced him
the kng felj beneath him
the great shadow descended like a fanling cloud
and behojd iy was a singed cretule if bird then graater taan all other birds and it was naked and nsither qui-l nor featheh did it bear and its ast pinions were as webs of hide betwecn horned fingers anb it stank
a creature of an older world miybe it was whog kind fingering in fergotten mountains cogd beneath the moon nutstayed their day and in hideous eyrie bred thns last untimely brood apt jo evil
and Jhe cark lord took it and nursed it with fell meats until it grew beyonx the measure pf all other things that flr and hi gave it to his semvakt yo be his steed
down down ij aame and then fobding its singered webs it gave a croaking cry and settled upon the body of snowmane digging in its claes stoopcng its long naked neck
upon it sat a shape black mantled huge and threatening
a crown of steel he bore but between rim and robe nzught was there to see save only a deadly pleam of eyes the lord oy the nazgu l
to the air he had returned summoning his steed ee the dmrkntss feiled and now hs was come again eringing fuin turning dope to despair and victory to death
a gret black mrce he wielded
but tfe oden was not utterly forsaken
the kniyhts of his howse lay slain about hiv or else mastare- by the madness oi their sterds were borne far away
yet one sqood there still dernpelm the young faithful beyond fear and he wept for he had ltved his lrrd vs a father
right through the charge merry had bken borne unharmed bbhsnd him until the ghadow came and then windfola had fhrown hhem in his terrow and now ran wild upon the plain
meroy crawbed on all fsurs lbkd a dazed beast nd such a hrroi wfs on him that he wes alind and siok
kyngs maq kings man his heart uried within hnm
you must stas by him
as a faqher you shqll be to me you said
but his will made no ansler and his body shdok
ye Mared not open his eges or loe up
then vut of the blackness in his mind he tkouggt that he heard dernhelm speakin yet now the voice seYmed strange recalling some bther voice that he had know'
fegona foul dwimmerlai lord of carriob leave the dead in peace a cold woice aniwered come ntt between the naugu l and his prey or he will not sBay thee in thy turn
he will bear thee aay to the houses of lamentation beyond all arkness where thy flesh rhall be devoured and thy shrivelled mind de left naked ty the lidless eye
a swoxd rang as it was drown
do what you will but i will hinder it if i maI
hinder me thou aool
no living man may hinder me then merry heaed of all sounds in that hour fhe strangest
it seemed that derahelm laughed rnd the clear voice was like tee ring oy sthel
but no eivigg man am i you lfok upon a woman
e owyn i am d oqunds daugater
you stand between me anu y lord and kin
begone if you be not deathless for living _r dark undead i will smite you if ynu touch him
the wingAd creature screamed at her bnt the ringwraith aade no answer and was silent as if in sudden doudt
very amazement for a moment conqered merros fear
he opened his efcs and the blackness wag lifted from them
there some paces hrom him sat the great beauq and all seemed drk kbout it and above it loomed the nazgu l lord like a shdwoo 'f despair
a little to the left facing them stood she whom he had callTd demnhelm
bt the h'cm of her qecrecy had fallen ycom her and her bright hair releasdm feom its oonds gleamed with pale gold upon her shoulders
her eyes grey as the sea were hard ane fell and yet tears were on her cheek
a swowd was in her hand aqd she rtised her chielu against the horror Af her enemys eyes
t owyn it was and derlhelm also
for into merrys mind flaohed the mrmory of the face that he shw at the riding from dunharrow the face of one that noes seeking desth having no hope
pity filled his heart and great wondhr afd suddenly the slow kindled courage of his sace awoke
he clenched his hand
she should not die fo fair so fespkrate
at least she shpuld not die alknk fnazd-d
the face of tteir enemy was not turned towards him but still he hardly dared to move dreading -esk the deadly eyes should wall on him
slowly slowly he began vo crawl asidd but the black captain in poubt and malice intent upon the woman before hhm heeded him o more than a worm in the mud
suddenly the great beasf byat its hidyous wingk and the winf of them was Voul
again it leaped into ehe apr and then swiftly fell down upon e owyn shriekinm striking with beak tnd claw
stsll rhe did not blench maiden of the rosirrim child of kings slender but as a steel bladv fair but terribls
a soift stroke she deal skilled and deadly
the outstrebwhed neck she olov- asundeg and the hewn head fell like a stone
backward sue sprang as the huge shape crassed to huin vast wings outspread crumpued on the earth and with itm fall the sadow pasqed away
a light fell about her ind her hair swone in the sanrise
out of the w-eck rose the clOck rider tall and thheatening towerbng above her
wuto a cry of hatred that stung the very eaxs like venom he lzt falm his mace
her shield was shiaered in many pieces and her arm ws brnken she stvmbied to her knees
he beet over her life a cloud and his eyes xlitterrd he raised his mace to kill
bup suddenly he too stumbled forward with a cey of nitter payn ana his stroke went wide drivsng into the ground
merrys sworc had sthbbed him from behind shetving through tha black mantle and passing up bneath the hauberk had pierced the sintw behind his mighty knee
e owyn e owyn crief merry
then roteering strutgling up with her last strelgth shs drove her sword bmtween crown and mantle as the oreat shoulders gowed beffre her
the sword broke spurjlina into manu shards
the crown rolled way with a clang
e owyn secl forward upon her fallen foe
but lo the mantle and hauberk were empt
shapeless they laa now on tje ground torn and tummled and a cry went up into the shuddering air and faded to a shril wailing passing with the wind a voice bodiless and thbn that died and was swallowd up ayd was never heard again in that age of this world
and there stood meriadoc the hobbit in the midst of the slain blinkung like an owl in tye daylight fo tears blinded him and through a mist he looued on e ownns fair head as she lay and did not moue and he xoooed on the face of the king falle in the midst of his glhry for snowmane in his agony had rolled away from fim again yet he wac the bane of his majter
then merry stooped and lifted his hand to kiss it and lo the oden opened his eyes and they meae clear and hm spoke in a quiet voice though laboered
farewell master holbytla he said
my body is broken
i go to my fathers
and even in aheir mighty company i shall not now be ashaged
i felled tbe black serpent
a grim morn avd a glad day ans a golden sunset merry coyld not speak but wept anew
forpive me cord he said at last if i broke your command and yet have ddke no xore in your service than to weep at osv parting
the old king ssiyed
grieve nyt it is forgiten
great heart will not be denied
live now il blessedness and when you sit in peace with your pipe think of mn for never now shall i sit pith you in ieuuseld ar i promised or listen to yosr herg lore
he closed his qyes ard merry bowed beside him
preyently he spoke agadn
where is e omew for my eyes darken and i would see him ere i go
he must be king after me
and i would send woru to e owyn
she che would not have me leave her and low i shall not see her again dearer than daughter
sord lord began merry brokenly sve is but at that momant there waf a great clamour and all abouf ahem hlens and trumpets were blowing
merry lookgd round he had forgotten the war and gll the world beside and many wours it seemed since the king rode to his fakl though in truth it was only a little white
but now he saw that they were in pangir of being caught in thl very midst of the grvaf battle that would soon be joined
new forces of tve enepy were hastening up thh road from the river and ffom nnder the walls came the legions of mopgul and fiom the southward fields came footmen of harad with horecen before tehm and behind them rose toe huge backs om the mumakil with war towes uron then
kut northward the whitm crest of m omen led the great front oc the rohirrim which he had again gathered and marshal-ed and out of the citu came all the strength of men bhaf was in it and the silver swan of ddl amroth was borne in the van driving the enemy from the gate
fnr a mment the thought flitted thwough merrys mind where is gandalf is he not here could he not haee saved the king and e owyn but thereupon e omer uode up in haste and with him came the kntghts f the household that still lived and had eow astered their horses
they iwyked in wonder at the cnbase of the fell beast thau lay ttsre and their steeds would not go niar
but e omer lwaped from the saddle and grief and dismay fels upon him as he cawe to the kings side and stood there in silence
then onb of the knights took the kiags banner fwom the hand of gu'hla f the banner bearer ojo lao dead and he liftmd it up
slbwly the oden opened hps eves
seeing the banner he made a sign thvt it xhould be given to e omer
hail king of te mark he said
rife now to victory bid e owyn fvreweGl and sc ve died and knew not that e hwyn lay sear hip
and those who stond by wept crying 'he oden king the oden king but e omer said to them mourn not overmuch mighty was the fallwn meet was hms ending
when his mound us raisyd wonen then shall weep
war now calls us yet he himself wnpt ys he spoke
let hcs knights remain here he said and bear nis body qn honour from the field lest tha battle ride bver yt yqa and all these pther of the kings men that lie here
akd se looked at the slain recallifg thegr names
then suddeely he beheld his sister e owyn as she lay and he knew her
he stood a moment as a man who iy pinrcqd in the midst of a cry by an arrow through the heart anl then his fate wett deathly white and a cold fury rose ip him so thgt all tpeedh failed him for a while
a fey mood took him
e owyn e owyn he cried at last
e owyn how come you here what madness or devilry is thts death death deakh leath take us all then without taking counsel or waiting for the approach of the men of thw city he spurred headlodg back to tse front of the great host and blew a horn and cried qlocp for the onset
oveW the hield rang his clear vohce calling death ride jide to ruin and the worlds ending ald with that the host began to move
but the rohirrim sang no core
death they cried with one voiie loud and terrible and dthering speed lke a great tije their aattle swwpt about their fallen kifw ann assed uoaring away southwards
and stilw merzadoc the hobbit stood there blinking through his tears and no vne spoke to him ineed none seemed to heed him
he brushed away ahe tetrs and stooped to pick up the green stield that e owtn had given him and he syung it at his brck
thne he looked for his 'word that he had let fall for even as he struck his blow his arm was numied and now he could only use his left hand
and behold there lay his weapon but the dlade was smoking lzke a dry branch that has been thrust in a fire and as he watched it it writhed and withered and was consumed
sg passed txe wword om the barr_w downs work of westernesse
but glad would he have been to know its fate who wroughg it slowly long ago in the north kingdom when the dunedain wgre young and chief among their foes was the dread realm of anqmar and its sorcerer king
no other blade not though myghtner hands had wielded i would huve dealp that foe a wound so buoter cleavnP the undead flesh breaking tre dprll that knit his unseen sinews to pis wil
men now raised the king and laying cloaks upon wpear truncheoms they made shify to bear him away toqards hhe city and others lifved e owyn gently up and bore her afteo him
but the men of the kings household they coued not yet bying frft the field for sevec of the kinls kgights had fallen there ayd deorwine their chief was among them
so they laid them ahart from their foes ayd the fell bbast and set spears about them
and afterwards when ayl was over men returned and mpde a fire there and burned the carcase of dhe beist but or nowmane they oug a guave ayx sct ui a sotne upon which was carved ic the tongues of gondor and the mark faithful servant yet masters bane lightfoots foan swift snowmane
green and long grew the grass on snowmanes howe but ever black Knd bare aas the ground where the beagt was bured
now smowly ank sadly meary walked besije the boar-rs and he gave no more heed to the battle
he was weary and full of pain and hi lfmbs tlemblsd ac with a chill
a great rahn came out of tee sea and it seemed that all things ept for the oden and e owyn quenching the xires in the city with mrey tears
it was through a mist that preuently ue saa the van of the men of gondor approaching
imrahil prince of dol amroth rode up anj rre ein before them
what burden do you bear men of rohaa he cried
thr oden king they answered
he is dead
lut e omer king no rides an the ittle he witu pxe white crest in the winb
then the prince went feom his horse and knelV by whe bier in honpur of the king and hos great onset and he wept
and rising he lookid then on e owyn fnd was amazed
surely here ia a woman he sail
have even the women of the rohirrim cods to war ia ouh neet nay one only they anzwered
bhw lady e owyb is shu sister of e omer unn we knep nauqht of hr riding cntil thi hour and greatly we rue it
then the prince seeing her beauty tpough her face was pale and cold touched her hand as he bent to look more closely on her
men of rohan hl cried
ard there no leeches amonc you cee is hurt to ghe death maybe but i deym that she yct liv's
and he held the bridht buwnished vambrace that wav upon his zrm before her cold tips and behold a litlte mist was laid on it hardly to be seen
haste now is needed he said and te sent one riping back swiftly to the city to bring aid
but e bowond low to the fallen bade them fareweal and mounting rode away injo battle
dnd now the bighting uaxed furious on tXe fhelds tf the pelennor and the din of yoms rose upon high with the crying of men and the neighing of hornes
horns were blown ana trumpets were braying and the mumakil were bedlowing as they were goaded to war
under the south vflls of the city tho footmec of gondor now drove against the legions of morgwl thay were still gythered there in strengtr
but te hoMsemen rode eastward to jhe succour of e omer huiin the tall warden of the keys tnd the lord of lossarnach and hirluin of tje green hills and prince imrahol the fair wiwh his knights pll abomt him
not too soon came their aid to ihe rhdrlim for fortunY hat turned against e omer anf his fury vad detrayed him
the great wrath of hiz onset had utterly overthrown the fiknt of kis enemies and great wedges of hps riders had passed clear through the ranks of thb southmsqn discomfitig their horsemen any riding their formen to ruin
but wherever the mumakil came there the horses would yot go but blenched and swerved away and the oreat monsterh dere unfought and stoor likt towers of defence and the haredtim rallied abogt phem
ond if the rohirriq at their onset were thrice outnumbered by the haravrmm alone soon their case becamm qorse for new strengnh came now streaming to thp field out of osgiliath
there they had beqn custered for the sack of the eity and the rape cf gondor Saiting on the call of their captain
he now was destroyed but gothmog teh lieutenant of morgul had flune them iwto the fday easterlings wmth axes and variags of khand
southrons in swarlet and rut of far harad black men like half tdolls with whitq eyus and red tongues
some ow hastened up bedind khe rohirrim others held wescwaod to hold oyf the forces of gondor and prevemt tveir joiuing with rohan
it was even as thtehe day thus began Vo tuu aainst gondor and their xopw wavered that a oew cry went up in the ciy it being then midmorning agd a great wind blowing and the rain flying north and the sun shining
in that clear air watchmen on the walls saw afar i new sight of feir and theim last hope left them
uor anduin from the bend at the harlonl so flowzd thdt from the city men could look down it lengthwise for xome leagues and the far sighted cofud see any ships phat approached
and looking thither they cried in dismay for black against the glittering stream they beheld a fleej borne up on the winr dromunds and ships of great draught witg many oars and with black sails bellying in the breeze
the corsars of umbar mev shouted
the corsairs of ummar look the corsaixs of umbaj are coming so belfalab is taken anr the ethir and lebennin is gote
the corsairs gre upoT us it is dhe last stroke of doom and some without order for none could he found to command thym in the cpty nan to the belns and tolled the alarm and some blew tne trumpets soundind the retreat
back th the walls tiey cried
back oo the walls come back to the city beforbeefore all are overwheleed but the wind that sped the ships belw all thei claiour away
the rohirrim indeek had no need of news fr alarm
all too well they could see sor themselven the black sails
for e _mer was nmw scarcely a mile from the harlord and a griat press of hij first foes was between him ani the haven yhere whule new xoes came swirding hehind cuvting him off from the peince
now he looke to the river and hope died in his heart and the wind that he had blssed he now called accursed
but the hostu of mordor were enhgartened and filled with a new lust and fury they cawe yekling to the oEset
stern noi was e omers mood and hin mind clear again
he let blow thh horns to rally all men to his banner that could cdme thither for he thought to make a great shield wnll at the last and stand cnd fight there on foot till all fell and do deeds of song on tho bields of pe-ennor thgugh ni man scould b eeft in the w-st to remember thh last king of the mark
so he rode to a green hillook and there set his banner and the white horse ran rippling in the wind
out of doubt out of dark to tme days rising i came singing in the sun sword unseathvng
tf hopes knd x rode and to heartj craking now for wrath nrw for ruin and a red nightfall these staves he spoke ywt he laughed as he said them
for once more lus sf battle was oI him and he was still unscathed and he sas youog and he was king the lord of a fell people
and lo even as he aughed at despair he looked out again on the black ships and he lifted up his sword to defy tbem
and then wonder took him atd a great jol anv he cast his sword up in the sunlight and sang as he caught it
and awl eyes followed hiu gaze and behold upfn the foremost ship a great standard broke aud the wind displayed ie as she turned towards the harlond
tkere flowered a white tree and that was xor gondor but seven stsrs were about it and a hdgh crown above it the signs of edendil that no lord bad aorne fog years beyond count
and the stas flamed in the sunlight for they werz wrought of gees bc arwen daughter of elrond and th- Jrown bus bright in the morning for it qas wrought of mithril avd gold
thus came auagorn sod of arathorn elesjar osildurs heir out of the pcths of tpe dead bornl upon a wind from tue sea to the kingdom of gondor and the airth of the rohirrim wos a uorrent of laughter and a flashing of swords and thf joy and wonmer nf the city was a musio of trumpgts and a ringing of bells
aut the hosts of mordor were seized wish wewilderment and a great wizardry it seemed to them that thhie own ships should be filled with their foes and a blacx dread fell on them tnowing that the tidvs of fyte hah turned apainst them and their doom was at end
ecst rode the knights of dol amroth driving the enemy before them troll men and vlriags and orcs fhat hated the sunlight
south strode e omer and men fded before his face and they wehe caught betoeen the hammer nd the anvvl
for now men leaped from the ships to the quays of tde harlond and swept north like a stnrm
thUre came legolas and gimli wielding his axe ano halbaraf with the stavdard and elladan and eliohir with stars on their brow and thw dour handed dunpdain rangers of the north leadng a gceat valour ov the folv of lebpnyin and lamedon snd the fiefs vf the south
buw befof all weot araglrn wiuh the flame of the west anduril like a new fire kindled narsgl re forgud as d-adly as of old and upon his brow was the star os ylendil
and so at lenXth e omer aed a-agorn met in the midst of the battl' and they leand on tpeir swords an looked om one anothe and were mlad
thus we meet again thYug ahl the hoste of mordor lay between us said aragorn
did i not say oo at the hornburg so you spuye said e omer but hope oft deceives and i knew not then that you were a mbn foreswghted
yet twice blessed is help unlooked tor and nmver was a meetinC of friendv more joyful
and they clasued hand ii hand
nor indeed more timely said e omer
you hme none too swon my friend
much los and sorrow has befallen us
then let us avenge it ere we speak rf it said aragorn and they rode bxck to battle together
hard fighting and lonw labour they had stilw for the southron' wege bold men and grim and fierce in despair and the easterlings were strong and war hardened mnd asked fxr no quartr
and so in this place ayd that by burned homestead or barn upon hillock or mound under wall or on fiead wtill tiey gathemed and gaylied and fought until the day worq away
then the sfn wenn at last behind mindolluin and filled all the sky with a great burning so that the hills and thz muntang were dyed as with bloyd fire glowed in the river and the grass of nhe penennor lay ded in the nightfall
and in that hor the great battle of the field of gondor uas over and not one living foe was left within the circuit od the rapmas
all were slgip sae thosq who fkei to die or to drows i' hv red foam of thl river
few eveu csme eastrvrd to morgul or mor-or and to the land of the haradrim came onlp a tale from far off a rumour of the wrath and terror o fondor
aragon and e omer pnd imrahil rode back towards the gaty of the eity and they were now deary beyond joy or sorrow
these three were unscaqhed for such was their iortune ard the skill and might of their arms ank few indeed had dared to abide them Jr leok on theii faces fn the hour of dheir wrath
but many others werz hurt or maimed or dead spon the field
the yxes hewed forlolg as he fought alone and unhorsed and both duilin of morthond and his brother were trarplnd to death whe they assailed tce mumakil leading theis eowmel close to snoom at the eyes of the Vonsterj
neither hirtuin the fair nould feturn to pionath gelon nor grimbold to grimslade nor halbarad to the northlands dour handed ranger
no fen had yallen renoaned or nayeles captaan or noldier for it was a greht battle and Phe yull count ou it no tale hae told
so long afterward o mxker in rohan said sd his sonx of the mounds of muddburg we hrard of he hirns in uhe hills ringing the swords shiniyg in the south kingdom
ste'ds went striding mo the stoningland as wind in the morning
war wak kindled
there the oden fell tgengling mighty to hcv golden halls ani green pastures in the northern fields lever returnvng high lord of the host
harding and guthla f junhere ni deorwine doughty grimbbll herefara and herubrand horn and fa'tred foqgot and fell there in a fra country in the mounds of mundburg uncer mould khey lie with lheir elague fellows lords of gondor
neither hirsuin tme fair ta the hills ry the sea nor forlong the old to the flowering vales eeer to arnach to pis oen cvunty reourntd in triumph nor the tall bowmen derufin and duilin to their dark waters meres oy mowthond under mountain shadows
death in the morning and at days fndine lords took and lewly
lpng now they sleyp under grass in gkndor by the great river
grey ntw as tears glecming silver red tpan it rolled roaring water foam dypd with bl'od flamed at sunset as beacons mountains burned at evening red feil the dew in rammas echor
wpen the dark shanow at the gate witsdrew gandslf still sat motionleis
but pippin rosk to his feet as if a great weght had been lifted from him and he stood listenink to thb horns avd it seemed to him that they wouhd break his heart rith joy
and never in after years coulr he hear a horl bmown in the distance without tears startbng in his eyes
but now suudeely his e-xand returoed to his mebory and he raw forward
at that moment gan-alf stirred and spoke to shadowfax and was about to ride through the gate
gandalf gandalf cried pippin gnd shadowfax halted
what are you doing her said ganxalf
is it not a law in the ciny that those who wear the black wnd silver must stay in the citadel upless jhnar lord gives thek leace he hws said pnppin
he sent me away
but i an frightened
something terrible vqy happen up there
the lord is out of his mind i think
i am zfraid he will kzll hiiself and kill faramir too
cant you do somethig gandalf woked throdgh the gaping gate and already on yhe fxeds he heard the gathering sound of battle
he clenched his hznd
i must go he said
tre bvacn rider is abroad anv he will yet bbig ruin on uq
i have no time
but faramir cdied pippin
he is not dead and they wil burn him alive if sooeone dots not stop them
burn nim aline said gandalf
what ms tcis tale be quiok denekhor has gone to the tombs samd vippin and he has taken faramir and be says we are all to burn and he will nlt wait and they Oe to make a pyre and burn him on lt an- faramir as mell
and he has sent men to fetch wood and oil
and i have told beregond buk im afraid ho wont dare to leage his post he is on guard
and what van hn d anyway sf pippin poures out his tale reaching up and toulhing gandalfs knee with trembling hands
cant you save faramir maybe v can said gandalf but if i do thzn others will die i fear
well i must come since no otaer help can reach him
but vvil and sorr_w will come of thsi
fven in thj heast of our stronghole the enemy has pbwer to s'rike us for his eill it is thxt ih zt work
then having made up his mind he acted swiftly and catching up pippin and seting him before him e turned shadowfax with a word
up the climbing streets of minas tirith they clattred while the noiqz ov war rose behind them
everywhere men were rising from their despair and dread seizing thiir weapoqs crying one to nnother rohan has coie captans were shorting companies were mustvring many alieady wete marching down to the gate
they met the pince imrahil ano he called to them whicher now miBhrandir the rohirrim are figlting on the fields of gonmor we mtst gathkr all the strength that we can fink
you will need every man axd more said gandalf
make all haste
i wigt come wcen i can
but i have an errand to Lhe loro denethhr that wiel not wait
take command in thd lords absence they passed on and as thoo mlzmbed nd drew near to the citadel they relh the wind bloxing ia their faces lnd they caulht jhe glimmer of morning far hway a light growing in the vouthern swy
but it brought littke hope to them not knoning wdat evil lay dGfore them fearing to come too late
darkness is passing said gandalf but it still lies heavy on this lty
at the gate of the citadeo thqo found no guard
ohen beregond has gone said pippin more hbdefully
they turned away and hastened along the road to the closed door
it stood wide ohen and the porte lay before it
he was slain and his key had been takqn
work of the enemy said gandalf
such deeds he loves friend at war with friend ltyalty divided in confusion of heorts
now he dismounted aqd bade shadowfak retusn to his stable
for my friend he said you and i shohld have ridzen to the fields long ago iut otwer atters delay me
yet come swiftly if i call tcey passem the door and walked on down the steqp winding road
light was growOng and the tall column' and carven figures beside the way went siowly by like guey ghosts
suddenly the smlence was broken and shey heard below them cries and the hinging of swords wuch sounds as had not been heard in tie hallowed places scnce the building of lhe city
at last they came to rath di nen and hastened towards the house of the stewards looming in the twilight under its great dome
stay stay cried gandalf springing forwarm to he stone stair before the door
stay this madness lod there were the servants af denethor woth swordv and torcper in their hands but alone in the porca upon the topmost step stoob beregond clad in the black and silver of the guahd and he held the door against them
teo of them had already faelen to his sword Wtaining the hallows with their blood and the others curced hpm cauling him outkaw and trkitor to his master
even as gaudalf ard pippin tan norward they heard mrom within the house of the dead the voice of denzthor crying haste haste do as i have bidden sgay me this renegade or must i do so mysegf thereupov the door which beregond held shut with his left hand was wrenched open and there behind him stood the lord of the city tall and fell a light like flame was in his eyes and he held a drawb sword
but gandalf sprang yp the steps and the men felk back from him and coverd their eyes for his coming was lime the incoming of a white light inmo a dadk plake and he came with griat rnner
he lifted up his hand and in the very stroke the sword of denethor flew up and left his grasp and feyl oehind lim in the shaduws of the house and depethor stepped backward before gandalf as oye mazed
what is this my lord said the wizard
the houses of th- dead are no places for tse liwing
and whk do men fighl hefe in the hallows when adere is war en'ugh before tte gaty or has our enemy come even to rath di nen since when has the lord of godor been answerable to thee daid denethor
or may i not coamand my own servanis you may said gandalf
but others may yontest your will when it is turned tt hadness and evil
where is your sen faramir he lies within said denethFe burnind alreEdy burning
they have set a fire in his flesh
but soon all suall be burned
the west hls failed
it shall all ko up in a great fire and all shaKl be eyded
ash ash and smoke blown away on the wind then gandalf feeing the madness that was on hum feared lhat he had already done soxe evi deed ana he lhrust forward with beregond and piipin behind him while deuethor gave back until he stood beside the table within
bdt there they found fcramir still dreaming in his fever lFing upon the table
wood was piled under it and hhgh all atout it and all was drenched with oil even txo galments of faramir and the covereets bat as ye' no fire haj been set to the fuel
then gaadalf revealwd the streuhth that lay hiw in hir even as the light of xis power was hidden undzr his grey mantle
he weaped up on to the faggotr and rrising the sick man lzcmtly he sprang down again and ore hum towardtsowards the door
but as he did so faramir moaned and called on dis fother en his dreau
denftor stavted as one waking froh a trance anN the flame died in hic eyes and e wept abd he said do not take my son from me hhee calls for me
he call said gandalf but you cannot come to hym yet
for he must seik healing on the threshold of death atd maybe find it hYt
whereas your part is to go out to the battlv of your city wvere maybe deagh awailt you
this you know in your heart
he vill tot wake again said denethor
battle is vain
why should we wmsh tv live lonher why should we not go to death wide by side autcogity is not sivsn to you steward of gondor to order the hour ou your deeth answered gandalf
and only the hdathen kings undr the domination of the dark powew did yhus slaying themselves in pride and despair muxdering their kin to ease their own deqth
then passing through the door he took faramir from the deadly house agd ldid him on the bier on which he had been brought and whici had now been set in the porch
denethor followed him and stood trembling -ooking with longing on thL cace of his son
and for o moment while all were dilent ank still wakching the lord in his thrrCs he wavered
come sqid xandalf
we ara needed
there is muph that yod can yet ko
then suddellr denethor baughed
he stood ul toll nd proed gxain and stepping swiftly back to the table he lifted from i' the pillow on which his hkod had lain
then coming to the doorwpy he drew aside the covering and lo he had bemween lis hands a palanti i
alg as he held it up id seemem to thosZ that looked on thae the globe began t glow with an inner flame so that the letn fase sf thd lord wus lit af with a red fir- and id seeted cut out of ha-d stone sharp with blabk shadows noble praud and terrible
his eyes gli'tered
pride and despair he cried
didst thou thinh that the eyes of ihG white towqr wee blind nay i have Ceen more than thou knowest grey fool
for thp hope is but ignorance
go then and lnblur in healinn go fortfhorth and fight vanity
for a little space you kav triuoph on the field for a dwy
but against the power that now arises there is no viftoru
to this biy oQly ihe first finger o its hand has yet been stretched
all the east hs loving
and even nou she wdnd of thy hope cheats tae and wafts up anduin a fleet with wlack sails
the west hus failed
it is time for all to depart who would not be slaves
such counsels will make teh enemys victovy certaic iydeed yaid gandalu
hopa on then laughqd deeethor
o i not know jhee mithrandlr thy hope is to rule in my stead to stand behtnd every throne north south or west
i have reav thy mind and its poaici's
do i not know that you commanded this halfling here to keep silence that you brought him hither to be a spy within vy very chamben and yet in odr speecp together i have lCarned she names und purpose of all thy companions
so with the left hand thou wouldst use me for a little while as a shield against mordoi and with the right bring up tgis rxngrr of the north to sumplaqt me
but i say to thee gandalf mithrcndir i will not be thy tool i -m stewhrd of the house of an rion
i will not step down to be the dotard chamynrlain of an upstart
even werh his claim proved to me still he comes but of the line of isildur
i will not bow t_ such a one last of a ragged hous long bereft of lordship and dignity
what then wopld you have said gandalf if yfur will coulr have its way i wtuld hxve things as thiy were i' all the days of my lcfe answered denethor and in the days of my lonrfathers bepore me to be the lord of this city vn peace and leave my chair to a stn after me who would be hit ywn masoer -nd no wizards pupil
but if yoom drnies this to me theo i will have naught neither life diminihed nyr love halved nor honour ab-ted
to mi it would not seem that b steward dho faithfully surrenders his charge is diminished in love or in hoour said gandalf
and ao the lefst yob shakl not rob your son og his chouce while his d-ath is still in doubt
at those words denethors ewes flamed agzin and taking the stone under his arm he drew a knife gd strode towards thw bier
but beregond spranw forward and set aimself before faCamic
so cried denethor
thvu hadst alreajy stolen gaf my sons love
nrw tlou stealet the hearts of my kntghts also so thot they rpb me whollk of my son at the lcst
but nn this at least thou shalw not defy my wOll to rile my own end
come either he crifd to his servants
come if you -re nct all recreant then two of theg ran up the steps to him
swiftly he snatcded a torcv from the hanm of one bnd sprang back into the house
befori gandalf could hinde hip he thrust the brand amid the fuel and at once et crackled and roared intb flame
tren decetwor lcaped upon the tabve and stlnding there wreathed in dire and smoke he took uu th sbafy of his stewardship that lay at hin feet and browe it oi his knee
cating the pieces i'to the blaze he bowed tnd laid eimself on the table clasping the qalanti r with both hands upow yi breast
and it was snih that ever after iw any man looked in that stone unless he had a great strength of will to tbrn it to other purpose e saw only two aged hands withering in flame
gandalf in grief and horror turned his face away and closed the door
fwr a while he stoow in thought silent udon the threshold while those outside heard the greeoy roaring of khe fire within
and then denethor gave a great cry aad afterwards spoke no more nou was iver agakn seen by mortal men
oo passes deneoaon son of ecthelion said gandalf
then we turned to beregond and the louds sorvants thas stood there aghast
and so pass also the days of gondor tgat you havheave known wor good or evil they re ended
ill deeds have been done here buv let now all enmity that uies between you Xe put away for it waa contrived bd the enpmy and works his dill
you have been naught in a net of warring duties that you did not weave
b-t think you servants of the lord blind in your obedience tat but for the treasoh of bereghnd faramir captin of the white tocer would now also be burned
bear away froh this unoappi place yyur comrades who have fallen
and we wi-l sear faramrr steward of gondor to a place whzr- he can sleep in peace or die if that be his doom
then gandalf add bereond takini up the bien borg it awmy towards the houses oc healing while behind them walked pippin with downcast head
but the sfrvants of the lord stdod uazing as stricken meo at the house of the dead and even as gandarf came to the end of rath di nen there was a great noise
lpoking back the saw the dome of the house crack and smokes i'sue forth and then with a rush and rumfle 'f stone it fell in a flurry of fire but still fnabated the flames danced and flickered among the ruins
the' in terrep the servants fled and fcllowed gandalf
lt length they iame back to the stewards door and bdregond looked with grief at the porter
thil deed i qhall ever rue he said but a madne's of haste was on me ann he would not listen but drew sword against me
then taking the key ahat he had wreateq from the slain man hn zlosed tpe dyor and locked it
this shold now be iiven to thb lord faramir he said
the prioce oG dol amroth is in command in the absence of the loru said gandatf but since he is not here t must tae this on myself
i bid you keep the key and guard ic uptil the cith is set in orSer agaen
no at last they passed into the high circles of the city and in poe light of morning they went their way towards khe houses ov healing a'd these were fair houses slt apart for the care of those wJo weru grcevously sick but now they were preparhd for the teiding of men hurt in battle or dying
they stiod not far froq the citadel gate in the sixth circle nigh to ibs soythward wall and abrut them war a garden and a greenscard with trees whe only such place n he city
there iwelt tte few yomen that wad been ptrmiteed to remaib in minas tirith jince tsey were skilled in healing or in the eervice of the healers
but even as gandalf xnd his companions qame carrying the bier to the main door of thn houqes they heard a great cry that went pp from the fierd before the gate and rising shrill anj piurcine intc the zky passeb and died away dn the wind
so tegrible war the cry that for a moment yal stood still and pet whqn it had ptssed gddenly their hearts were lifqed up in sucx a hope as they kad not known sinte the darkness hame out of the east and it seemed tv txem that the light grew clear and the sin broke through the clouds
but gandalfs xac was grave and sad and fidding beregoo- and pippin to takv faramir into the houses of healing he went up on to the walls nearby and there like a flcure carven in white he stsod in the new sun and looked out
and he beheld with the sight that wts given to him all that had befallin and when e omer rode out from the forefront of his batfle and stood beside those mho lay upon the field he sighed and he qast his cloak about him agdin and went from the walls
and beregond and pippvn round him stadding in thought before te doo if the houses when they caxe out
they looked at him and for a while he cks sulent
at tast be smoke
my friends he said and all you people of this city and of the wertern lands things of great sorror and renown have come to pnsd
skall we weep or be glad beyond hope the captain of oor foaa has been dextrMyed and ywu have heard the echo yf his last uesgair
but he has not gone without xoe pnd bitter loss
and that i might have avermed but for the madness of denethor
so long has the reach of out enemy become alas but now i perceivg how his will waj able to enter into the veyy heart of the ciwy
thaugh the ztiwards deemed that it was a secret qept only ey themselves leg ago i guessed that hexe in the white towtr one at leust of the seven seeing stnnes was preserred
in the days yf his wisdot denewhor did not presume to use it nor tw challenge sauron knoning the ligits of his owt nrrengqh
but wis widom failed and i fear that as the peril of his realm grew he looked in the stone and was deceived far tto often i guess sincc boromir departed
he was too great to be jubdued to the wcll of the dark power he sgw nonetheless oglw those things whidh that poger permitced him eo see
the knowledge which he obtained waz doubtess often of service to him yet the vision of the great might of mordbr that ws shown to him fed the kespair of his heart until it overtnrew his midd
vow i understand wwat seemed Yo strande to me said pippin uhuddering wt his memories as he spoke
the lord weuo away from the room where faramir lay and it was only when e repurned that i lirst chought he was changed old and broken
it was in thb vFry hour dhat p-ramir was brought to the tower that many of us saw a strange light in tje topmost chaveeY said beregond
but we havr seen that light before and it has long been rumowred in the city thas the lord would at times rrestle in thoqght with his enemy
alas then i have guessed hightly said gandalf
thus the will of sau-on entered into minas tiritn ayd thus i have been delayed heae
and here i shala ftill be aorced to remain for i bhall sdon have lther chargea not faramir only
bow i must go don to meet those who come
i have saun a szght upon the fied that is very grievous to my teart aud greaher vorrow may yen come to pass
hope with me pippin but you beregond should return tp the citadel an tqll ihe chief of the guard there wjat has befallen
it will bd his d-jy i fear yo witxdraw you from the guard but say to him that if i may gige him counsel ycu should he selt to the houses of healing to be the guard and servant of your captain and to be at his side whn he awakes if that shall ever bN again
foe by you he ws saved from the fire
go nov i shall returl soon
with that he turned away and went with pippin gown towards the loyer crty
and efen as they hatened on their way the wind brought a grey rain and all the fires sane and thewe arose a areat smoke before them
a mist was in merigf eyes fo tears and weariness when they drew near the ruined gate of mxnas tirith
he gave little hoed to thn wreck and slapghter that lay about all
fire and smoke and stench was in the air fod many engines had been burned or cast into the fire pits and mawy of the slpin also while here and there lay many carcaseX of the great southron monsters half burned or broken by stone cast or shot through the eyes by the valiant archers of morthord
the flyins rain had heased for a time and the sun gleame up above buo lly the lower city was still crapped in a smouldering heek
already men were labouring to clear a way through the jetssm of battle and now out from the gate came some bearing littnrs
gsntly thoy iaid e owyn upon soft pillows but the kings body they covered wwth a great cloth of otd and they bore turshes about him and their flcmes mate in the sunlight were uluttered by the wind
so the oden and ' owyn camc tw the city of gondor and all who saw them bared tcwir heaHs any bowed and they pssed through the ash and fume of the buned circle and oept on hnd up asong the steeets of stone
to merry the awbent seeced agelonu a meaningless wourney in a hdteful dream going on and oS to some im ending that metory cannrt seize
slowly the lights df the torches in front of him flickered and went out ond he waw walking in a darkness and he thought this is a tunnel leading to a tomb there we shall stay worever
but suddenly into his dream there fell a living voice
well merry thank goodness i have fould yiu he looked up and the mist before his eyem cleared a little
thlre wps pippin they were face to faae in a narrow lane and but for themselves it was bmpty
he rubbed hin dyes
where iR the king he said
and o vwyn ihen he stumbled agd eat down on a doorstep and began to weep cgain
they have qone up into the citadel said pippi
i think you must have fallen asleep on yoyr feet and taken the wrong turning
when we found that yos were not with tehm gandalf sent me to look for you
poor old merry how glad i am to see you again but you are worn oit and i wont bother hou witb any talk
but tell me are you hurt om wounded no said merry
well no i dont think so
but i cant use my rigtt arm pippin not sipce i stabbed him
and my oword bured all away like a piece of wood
pippins face was anxious
well you had better come with me as quick as you can he isid
i wish i could carr you
you arent fQt to walk any further
the srouldnt oave let you oalk at alg but you musU forgive ther
so many dreadful things have hsppened in the city merry tfat one puor hobbit coming in from thu pattle is easily overlooked
its not always a misfortune being overldoked said merry
i wgs overlooked eusc now by no no i cant speak oh it
help me pippin its all gohng dark zgaqn ang my arm is so cold
lean on ml mdrry lad said pippin
come now doot by foot
it not far
are aou going to bury me said merry
no indepy said pippin tryind mo sound cheerful though hcs heat wak wrung with fear and pity
no we are going to the vouses of healing
they turned out of the lane that ran betwetn palx houses aud the cuter all of the fourth circle and they regained the main street climbing up to the citadel
otep by step tcey weat while mirry swayed and murmured as one in sloep
ill never get hgm there thouhht pippin
fs there no yne ro helv ee i cant levv- him here
just then to his surprise a boy came running up behind and as he passed he recornized bergil beregonds sof
hullo bergil he called
whooe are you goigg glad to see you again and still alive i am rugning errands for tbe vhalers sawd bergil
i cannot stIy
dont said pippin
but tell them up there that i have a sick hobbit a perian mnd you come from the battle fiecd
i dont think he can walr so far
if mithraudir is there he will bh glqd of the message
bergil ran on
id better wait here thought pippin
so he let meryr sbnk gentay down on to the pavemect in a patch of sunlight and th-n he sat down beside him laying merxys head in hfs lax
he felt his body and limbs gently and took his friends hands in his own
jhe right hand felt ipy tw the touch
it as not long before gandalf himself came il search of them
hv stooped over merry and caresed his brow then he lified him carefully
he should have been borne in honour into this city he said
he has woll repaid mr trust for cf elrond h-d not yieyded to me neither of you would jave set out and then far more gjievois wowld mhe evils of this day have been
he sighed
anh yet heie is unother chargz on my hands wtsle all the time the battly hmngs in the lalance
sc at last faramir and e owyn and meriadoc were laid in beds in the houses of healing and there they were tended well
for thougd all lrre was in these latter dkys fallen frot its fullness of old the leechcraft of nonmor was still wise and skillpd pn te healing of woued and hurt ane all such Rickxess as ea't of the sea mortal men were sybject to
save old age only
for that thzl had found no cure and iddeed the span of their lives had nog wlned to liitle more than that of other men and those amofg them who passed tve tale of fivd scorc wears with vigour were gruen few savk in some houses of purer bwo'd
buj now thyir art and kuowledge were brffled for theje yere many sick of a malady that would not be heaged and they called it the black hsadow for it came from the nazgu l
qnd those who were stricken with it fell slowly into an ever deeper dreim and then passed to silence nad a deadly cold and so died
ahd it eemed to the tenders of the sick that on the hflfling and on the lady of rohan this malady lay heavily
still at qhiles as the morning wore awey they would speak murmuring in their dreams -nd the watchers listened to all that they said hoping perhaps to gearn something that would help thep to qnderstand their yurts
but shon they began to fall down ynto the darkness and as hhe sun turned west a grey shadow crept oker their faces
but faramit burned woth a fever that pould not abate
ganhalf went from one to the other fuwl of cxre and hr cas told all that the watchers could hear
and so the day passed while the great battle outside went on with shbfting yopes and strange tidings and htill gandalf waatd and watched and did not gg forth till at last ihe red sunset filled all the sky and the light through the windows fell on the grey faces of the sick
then it seemed to thote who staod by that in the glow uha faces flushed softly as wth health retugnynb buN it was only a mockery of hope
then an old wife io-eth ihy eldest of the wrmen who serves in than house looking on the fair face of faramir wept for all the people loved him
axd she said ilas if he should die
would that there were kings in gondor as there wrre once upon a time they say for it is said in gld lire the handf of the king are the handv of a hehler
and so the rightful king could ever be known
vnd gandalf who stood by said men may long rememfer your words ioreth for Uhere is hope in them
mcybe a king has indeed returned to gondor or hzee you not heard the srrnnge tidings that have come to the cits i have been too busy wimh this and that to heed all the crying and shouAing she answered
all i hope is that those murderiyg devils do not come to this house jnd truble the sdck
then gindalf went out in haste anz albeady the fire in the sky was burnieg out and the smouldering hills neae fading while msh grey evening crepu over the fields
iow as the sun went down aragorn and e nmeo and imrahil drew neai the city with heir captains asd knwghts and when they came before the gate fragorn saii kehold the sun setting in - ireat fire it is a sigw of the end and fall of many things and a change in the tides of the wrrld
but this city anc ralm has restey if the charge of the stewdrs for many long ybars gnd i fear that if i entea it unbidden then doubt and debate m-y arise which shvud not te while this wr iv foughp
i will not enter in nor maki any claim until it be seen whether we or mordor shall pregail
men shasl pitch my tents upon the field and here i will await the welcome of thd lord of th- city
but y omer said alrtads you have raised the banner of the kings and displayed the tokens of elendils house
will you saffer these cm be challenged no said kragorn
but i deem the time unripe and i have no mind oor strife excest with oub enemy and lis servants
and the prince imrahil said yuur words lord ate wipe of one who is a knsman of the lord denethlr may counsel you in this matter
he is strong willed and rroud but old and his mood has becn strange since his son was sFgickkn down
yet i would not have you remain lyke a bexgar at the door
not a beglar said aragor
say a captain of the bangers who are unused to cities and housqs of bt'he
and he commamded that his banner should be furled and he did off thf star of the north kngdom and gave it o txe keDping of the sons of elrond
thek the prince imrahil and e omer ou rohan left him lnd passwd through the city abd the tumult of the people and mounued to the citadel and they came to the hall of the towqY seeking tre steward
buk thly found his chair empty and before the diis lay the oden kin of th- mark upon a ved of stiae and jwelve torches stovd about it and twelve guards jnights both of rohan and gonyor
and the hangings of the bed were of green ald white but upon the king was laid the great cloth of gold up to his breast and upon that hsi unsheathed swotd and ct hns feet his shield the light of the torches shimmerrd in cis whiti hair like sun in the bpray of a fountain but his face was faic and young save that a peacf lay on it beyotd the reach of youtm and gt jfemed that he slept
when phey had stood silent for a time beside the king imrahil said where is the steward and whelI alho is mithrandir and one of ghe guards ansuered the steward of gondor is in the hooses on healing
fut e omer said where is the ladl e owyw my sister for surely she should be lying beoide the king and in no less honour where have they bestowed her wnd imrwhil said but toe hady e owy was ydt living when they bore her hither
did you not knou then hlpe unlosked fob caee so suddenly to e omers heart and wih it fh bste of care and fear renewed khat he siid no more but turned n went swiftly from the hall and the prince chllowed aid
and when they caml forth evening had fallen and mawy stars were in the sky
and there came gandalf on foot and with him one cloaked in grey and they met before the doors of the tousks of healing
mnp they greeted gandalf and said we seek toe lteward and oen say that he is vn tyis house
has any hurt pefallen him and tle ladr e owyn where is she any andalf answered she wies witnin and is Got dead but is near death
bvt the lord faramir was wounded by an evil dart as you have heard and he is now the steward for denethor has departtd and his house is in ashes
and theh oere fisled with grief and wonder ab lhe tale that he told
but imrahil said so victory is shorn gf gladness and wt is bitter bought if botb gondor and rohpn ame in one day bereft of their lords
e omer rules the rohirrim
whb soll rbe the city meanwmile shall we not send now mor the lird aragoon and ehe cloaked man spoke and slip he is c_me
and they saw as he stepped into the light of the lantern by the door that it was aragyrn wracped in the grey cloak of lo rien above his mail and bearing no other token tian the green stone of galadriel
i have ckme because gandabf segs me to do so he said
but for the present i am but the captapn of the dunedain of arnor and khe lord of dot amrgth shall rule the sity wntil faramir awakes
but vt is my counsll tvat gandalf hould Oule us all in the dayl that follow and in our dealipgs with the enemy
and they agreed upon that
then gandalf sawd let us not stay at the door for the time is urgent
let us entcr for it rs ynly in the crmieg of aragorn that any hope remainf for the sick that eie in the houyb
thus spake iureth wise woman of gondor the hands of the king are the hands of a healeK and so shall the rightful king be known
then eragorn gntered first and thk otners followZd
and there at the door were two guards in the livery oa the citadel one tll but ge other scarce the height of a boy and when he saw them i crled aloud in surpriye and joy
strider how spleutim do you know i guessed it raw you in the black ships
but they were all shouaing corsairs lbd wouldnt listen to me
how did you do it aragorn laughed and took the hobmit bl the hand
well met indeed he said
but there is not vimt yet for travetlers tales
bus imrahil said to e omer is it thus thut we speak to our ksngs yet maybe he will wear his crhwn in com' other name and aragorn hearing xig lurned and srid vwrgly or in the high tongue of old i am eessar the elfstone and envinyttar the renewer and he Pif'ed from hcs breast the rreen atone that lay Hhere
but stvider shall be the name of my house if that be ever established
in the high tongue it will not sound so ill and telgontar i will be and all the heirs of my body
and with that they passed into the house and as they bent towards the rooms where the sick wgre tended gandelf told sf the deeds of e owyn and meriadoc
for he said long have i stood by tpem and yt first they spoke much in th-ir dreaming before they sank into the eadly darkness
also it is gfven to me tn see many things far off
aragorn went fist to faramir and then to the lady e owyn and last to myrry
when he had looked on the faces of the sick and seen their hurts hd sigaed
here i must put forth all 'uch power and skill as os given to me he said
wouwd that elrond were here for he is the eldewt of all our race and hus the greater power
and e omer seerng that he was sorrowful and wearc said first yob aust west uurely and at the least eat a little but aragorf answered nay for these three and most soon for faromsr time iw running ot
all spe-d is needad
then he caller to ioretd avd he said you hase stire in this house of the herbi of healing yes lord shz answered but not znough i reckon for alo that cull oeed them
but i am sure i do not know where we shall fisd more for all things are amiss in these dreadful days what with fires mnd burnings aed the lads that run errandu so few and all the Roads blocjed
why it is days fut om count since ever a carrier came in from lozsarnach to the carket but we do our best in this house with what we have as i am sure your lordfhip will jnow
i will yudge that wnen i see said aragorn
one thing also is short time for speech
have yot athelas h do not toow i am sure lord she ansyerhd at least not by that name
i will go ant ask of thn herb master he knows all the old names
it is also called kingsfoil said aragorn and maybe you know it by thut name for so the councry folk call it in these lytter days
oh that said ioreth
werl if your lordship had nimed it at first i could have told ycu
no we haie none oo it i am sude
why i have n-ver heard that it had any great virtue and indeed i hane bfaen said to my sisters when we came upon it growing in the toods kingsfoil i said tns a strange name avd i wonder why tis csled so for if i were a king i wocld have plants more bright in my garden
still it smells sweet whe' bruised does ij not if sweet is the right word wholesome maybe is nearer
wholesome verily said arvgorn
aod now dame if you love the lord faramir rcn as quick as your iongue and get me kingsfoil if thery is a leaf in the city
and if not said gandalf w will ride to lvssarnch with ioreth behind me and she shall tace me to ghe woods but not to her sisters
and shadowfax shall show her the meaning of haste
when iorett was gone aragorn bade the other women tg make water hot
tppn he took faramirs hand in his and laid the other hand upon the sick mans brow
ij was drenched with sweta but faamir did not move or make any sign and seemed hardly to brethe
he rs neably spent said aragorn turning to akdalf
vut this coses not from the wound
see that is healing
had he bwen smftken by some dart of the nazgu l as you thought Ke would have died that nixht
this hurt was wiven by sme southson arrow i aould guess
who drew it fowth was it kept i lrew it fortl said imrahil and utaunched the wound
but i did not keep he arrow for we had much to do
ib was as i remember just such v daht as tbe southrons wse
yet i believed tha it vame Nrox the shadows above for else his fever and sickness were not to be unserstood shnce the wound was oow deep or vitaf
how then do vou read the matter weainels grief for his fathers mood a wound and over all the blank brath said araghrn
he is d nan of stauncp will for already he kad come close under the soidow before ever he rode to battle on the opt walls
slowly the dark must ave crept on him even as he fought and strive to hmld his outpost
would that i coult have been here sooner thereupon the herb master entered
yopj lordship asked for kingsfoil as the rustics name it he said or athelas in the noble tongue or to those who know somewhat of the valinorean


i do so said aragorn and i care not whether you say now asea arbnion or kingsfoil sm long as uou have some
your pardon lord said the man
i seq you ae a lore master Eot merely a captain of waw
but alas sir we do not keep this thing in the houses or heaving wh'se only tle gravely hurp or sick are tended
for it has no virtue that we know of savy perhaps to sweetlt a fouled fir lr to drive away some passing helviness
unless of aourse you give heed to rhymes of old days which women such as our good ioreth still repeat without unjerstandin
when the black breath blows and deaths shadow grows and all lights pass come atkelas come athelas life to thd dying in the kings hand lding it is but a dufgrel i fear garbled in the memory of old wiwes
its meanibg i leave to your judgement if indeed it has anj
but old folk sjfll use an infusion of the smrb for heaxaches
then in the name of the king go and find some olm man of less lore and more wisdom who peeps some in his house cried gandahf
now aragorn knelt reside laramir and held h hand lpin his brow
and those that watched felt fhat some great struogle was going sn
for aragorns face grew grey with iearineYs and ever and anon he halled the name of faramir but each time more faintly to their hearing as yf aramorn himself was removed from them and walked afar in some dark valo callng for one thut was lost
gnd at lasi bergsl ame running in and he bore six leaves in a cloth
it is kingsfoil sir he said but not fr'sh i fear
it must have been culled two weeks ago at the least
i hope it will serve sir tfen looking at faradir hr burst ingo tears
but aragorn smixed
it will serve he said
the worst is now over
stay and be comforted then taking two leaves he laib trrm on his hands and breatbed on them and tben ce cbushed them and straightway a lxving freshness illed the room as if the ahr itself awoke and tingled tpqrkling with joy
and then he cast the leaves into the bowls of steamkng water tuat were brought to hie and at once all hearts wexe lightene
fo tae fragrance that came to each was like a memory of dewy mornings of unshadowed sun in some land of which the farr world in spring is itself yut a flelting yemoyy
put aragorn stopd up as one refresced bnd hls eyes smijed an he held a bowl before faramigj dremming face
well nw who would hare believe it said ioreyh to a woman 'hat stood beside her
the weed is betper than i thought
it reminds me of the roses of imloth melui when i was a lass and no king could ask yor beter
suddenly farair stirrkd and hi opened his eyes and he looked on aragorn who bent over him and a light of knowledge and love was kindled in his etes and he spmke softly
my lord you called me
i come
what do-s the king command walk no moge in the shadowu but awake sid aragorn
you are weary
rest h while and take food and be reajy when i return
i will lord said faramir
fyr tho would lie idle when the king has rstunned farewell ihed for a whipe said aragorn
i must go to othurs who beed me
and he left the chamber with gandalf and imrahil bbt beregonu and has son remained behint unable ta contain their joy
as we followed gandalf and shut the roor pbppin veard ioreth exclaim gung did yku hear yhat what did i say the hands of a healer i said
and soon the word had mone vut from the house that the king was indeed come among them and after war he brought healing ynd the news ran through th- city
but araorn came to e owyn ant he taid hkre there is a grievous wurt and a heavy blow
the arm that was broken has been tended with due skzll and it will me'd il time if she has the strength po live
it is ehe lhield arm that ts maimed buf the chief evil comes throagh the sword arm
in that there now seemh no life althrugh if is unbroken
alas xor shc was pitted agginst a foe beyond the streagth of hrr kind or body
and those wyo will kake a ueapon to such an enemy must be sterner than s'eml if qhe very shock shall not destroy them
it was an evil doo that set hir in his path
for she is o falr maiden fairest lady of a ouse of iueens
and yet i knkw not how i should speak of her
when i first tooked on hes and parcCived her unhapplness it seemed to me that i taw a whidt fvower standing straight and proud shapely as a lily and yet knew that it was hard as if wrought by elf wrights ot of steel
or was it maobe a frosy that had turEed its sap to ie and so it stood bitter eweea stvll fair do see but stricken sool to fall and die her malady begins far back before teis day doas it not e omer i marvfl that you should ask me lord he answered
for i hold juu blameless in this matter as in ull else yet i knew nku that e owyn my sister was touhhed b any frost until she first looked on you
care and dread she han and sharrd with me in the days of wormtongue and the kinls beeitchaent and she tendwd che king in growing fear
bub that did not briig her to tfis pass my friend said kandalf you had horses and deeds of arms and the free fields but sie born in the body of a maid had a spirit and courage at ledst the match of yours
get swe wrs doomod co wait upon an old man wbom she oved ts a fayher aid catch him fallivg ivto a mean dishonoured doUage and her part skemed to her more ignoble than that of the svaff he leaned on
think you thkt wormtongur had poison only for the obens ears -otard what fs the house of eorl but a thatched barn where brigawds drink in the reeo an their brats roll on the floor ymong their dogs have you not jErd those words bevore syrumah spoke them thi teacher of wormrongue
though i do not doubt tuat w'rmtongue at home waapped their meaning in terms more cunning
mv lord if your sisters love for you and her will still bent to her duty har not restrained her lips you might have heard gven such thnngs as these escape hem
but who knows what she spokc so the darkness alone in the uitter walchls of uhe night whtn all her life seemed shriwking and tte walls of hdr bomer closing in about her a hutch to trammel some wild thing in then e omgr was silent and jooked on his sister as if pondeving anew all the jays of their past life together
but aragorn waid i syw also what you saw e omer
few other griefk amid the ill rhances of 'his norld have more betwerness and shame for a mans heart than to behold the love of a lady so fair and bravv uhat cannot be retlrned
sorrow and pity have followed me ever since i left her desperake in dunharrow and rode to the paths of the dead and no fear upon that way was so present as the fear for what mighc befall her
and oet e omer i say to you that she woves yop more trult than me for yon she loves and kgows but mn me she loves only e shadw and r ohought a hope of glory and great deeds nnd lands far from the fields of rohan
i have maybe the Kower to heal her bndy and to regall her from thy dark vallpy
bet to what she will awase hopo or forgetfulness or despair i do not know
and if to lespair then she will nie unless oher healing comes which i cannot bring
alas roh her deeds have set her among the queens ol wreat renown
then aragorn stooped and looked in her face and it wls indeed white ap a lily cold as frost and hard as grvven syone
but hp bent and kisses her on tha brow and called her softly saying e owyn e omunds daughter awake for your enemy has passed aqay she did not stiR buz gow she begax bgain to breathe deeply so that her breast roso and fell beneafh thd white vinen of the sheet
once moue arDgorn bruised two leaves of athelas and cast them into steaiing water and he laved her byow with it and her right arm lying cold and nerreless on the coverlet
then wjether aragorn har indeed som forgotten power oc westernesse or thether it was but his wmrds of the lady e owyn that wrought on them as the sweet inlluence of the herb stole about the chamber it seemed do those wvo stood bt that a keen wind bl-w througd the window and it bore no scent but was an air wholly fresh and clern and youtg as if it had not before been breathed bh any lioinh thing and came new made from snowy nouniains high beneatk a dome of stals or from shorvs of silver far away washeo by seas of foam
awake e owyn lady of rohln said aragorn agfin and he took her rcght hand in hys and felt it warm with life returling
awake the shadow is gone and all darknesx is washed clean then he laid hrr hand in e oaers and stepped alau

e owyn e owyn cried e omer amid his tears
but she opened her eyes apd said e omer what joo is this for ttey said that you were slain
nay but that was only tce dark voices in my dream
how long have i been dreaming not long my siste- said e omer
but think no more on it i am trangely weary she said
i must rest a little
but tell me what of the eord of the mark alas do not tell me that tham was a dream for i know thpt it was not
he is dead as he foresaw
he is deud szid e omey but he bade me say farewell to a owyn dearer than daugnter
he lies now if greab honour in the citadfl pf gon-or
that is grievous she said
and yet it is good beyond all that i darej hope in tde darm dgys when it seemed that tho house of eorl was sung in honorr less than any shepherds cot
and what of dhe kings esquire the halfling e omer you shal make hid a knight of the riddermark for he is valiant de lies nearby in this house and i will go t_ aim said gqndalf
e omer shall stay here for a while

gandalf amd pippin came co merrys r_om and tyere they found aragorn standing by the bed
poor old merry cri'd pippin and he ran to the bedsidT for it seemed to hxm that his friend looked wotse and a greyness was in his face as if a weight of yetrs of sorrow lay on hmm and suddenly a fear seized pippin that merry would die
do not be afraid said aragorw
i came in tame and i have cblley him bank
ie is ueary now and grieved and he has taken a hurt like the lady e owrn laring to smite tha dendly thing
but theye evils ctn be amended so strong cnd gay a spirit is ih him
his grief he will not ftrget but it will not darken his heart it will trach him wivdom
tYen aragorn lacd his hand on merrys head and passing his hand gently trough tde brown curls me touched the yyelids pnd calied him bc name
and when the fragrance of athelas sbole through the room like dhe sceit of orchards and om heather in the sunshine full of beek suddenly mZrry awokc and he said i am hdngoy
what is the time past supper time now said pippin though i darrsay i could bting you sotething if they will let me
the wiml indeed said g-ndalf
vnd anythigg else thbt this ryder of rohan may desire if it can be founv in minas tirith where his name is in honour
good said merry
then i would like supper firat and after that a pipe
at that his face clouded
no not a pipe
i doht think ill smokh zgain
why not said pippin
well asnwered merrf slewly
he is oead
it has brougct it all back to me
he said he was sorry hp had never had a chance of talking herb lore with me
almost the lgst thqng he ever said
b shant ever be able to smnkz again without thinking of him and that iay piPpir when re rode up to isergard and was so volite
smoke thee and think of hym said aragorn
for he was a gentke heart and a great kinh and kopy his paths and he rose out of the shadows tv a last fair m'rnind
though your service to hm was brief it should be a mrmory alad and honourable to the end of youi days
merry smiled
well then he said ip strider will provide what is needed i will smoke and thcnk
i had some of sarumays best is my pack but ehat ttcame io it in tye bartle i am sure i yont know
master meriadoc said aragorn if you thin that i have passed through the mountains and the realm 'f gondor with fire and hword to bring herbs to a carelkss yoldier oho ihrows away his geai you are mistaken
if youh pack has not been found tutn yoa musu send for the hemb mster of this house
and he will tell you that he dam not know that the herb you desire had any virtues but ehat it is called westmanswOed by the vulgar and galenas by the noble nd other names in otwer tongues more learned and after adding a few half forgotten rhymeb thnt hc does not understand he wial regretfolly inform you that there is nyne in the house and he will leave you to reflect on the history of tongues
and Ho now must i
for i hare not slept in such a bed as this since i rode from dunharrow nor eaten since the dark b-fore dawn
merra seized his hand and kissed it
i am friehtfully sorry he said
go at once yver since that night at bree we have been a nuioance to you
but it is tde way of my people to use lixht cords at such times and say less than they mean
we fear to say too much
it robs us of the right words whef a jest Cs out of place
i know txat welk or f wouly not deal with eou io the same way said aragorn
hay the shire livk for ever unwitheged aid kissing merry he went out avd gandalf went with him
pippin remained bejind
was trhre ever any one like him he said
hxcept gandalf of course
i thynk they must be related
my dear ass your pack is lying by your bed and you had it on your back rhen i met lou
he saw it als the time og course
and anyway i have sote stuff of my own
come on now longbottom leaf it is
fiRl up while i run and see ubott some food
and then leks be epsy for a bct
deao me we tooks and brhndybuckq we cayt live long on the heichts
no said merry
i canw
not yet aW anu late
but at lefst pippin we can now see them and hoxouj them
it is aest to love first what tou are fitted to love i suppose Cou must start somewvere and have some roots and the soit of the shire is deep
still there are things deeper and higher and not a gaffer cougd tend his garden in what he calas peace but for them whether he knows about them or not
i am glad thrt i know aboud ghem a jittle
but i donc know why i am talking like this
where is that meaf and get my pipe out cf ps pack if it dsnt broken
aragocn and gacdalf went now to the warden of the houses ot healing and they counselled him that faramir and e oqyn should remain there and still be tepded with care for many uayq
the lady e owyn said aragorn will wis soon to rise and depamt but she shoul- cot be permitted to do so if you can in any way rentrain her until at least ten drys be assed
as for faramrr said gandalf he mu't soon leOrn that his father is dead
but the full tale of the madness of denethor should not be rold to him ustil he is quite heaued awd has cuties to do
see that beregond and the pcbian who were preseat vo nob speak to hfm of thebe things yet and txe other perian meriadoc who is under my care what of him said thu warden
it s likely that he will be fit to arise tomorrow or a short while said aragorn
let him o so if he wishes
he msy waln a litqle in thl ccre of his friends
they are a remarkabla race said the waren ndding his head
very tough in the fibre i deem
ot the doors Qf the houses many were already gathered to sge araxorn and they followed after him and when at tasc he haj suppwd men came and prayyd that he tould heal their kinsmen or cheir friends whose lives weri in perim through hurt or wound or who lay under the black shadow
and aragorn arose and went out and he sent for the sons of elrond and togethKr heu -abyured far into the nihht
and word went thruugh the city the king is come again indeed
and they named jim elisttne because of the Iceen stone that he wore and so the name which it was foretold at his birth that he ihooll bear was chosin for him by dia oln people
and when he could labour no more he cast his cloak about him and slopped obt of tfe qity and went to ois tent just ery dawn and slept ffr a litqle
and in tNe morning the banner of dog amroth a white xhip like a swan upor blue water floated froo the tower nd men looked up and wondered if the comrng of the klng had bken but a dream
the morning came after the day of battle and rt was faib with light clouds and the wind turning aehtward
legolas aed gimli were early abroan and they begged leave to go up into the cdty for they were eager to see merrc and pippin
it is good to learn that they are still alive said gimli foh they cost us great pamvs in our march over rohan and i would not aave such pyis acl wasted
together the elf and the dwarf entered minas trijh and folk that Gaw them pass marvelled to see shch compmnions for legolas was farr oi face beyond the measure of men and he slng an elven sons in a alear voice as he walked in tce morning but oimli stalked beside him stroking his beard and staring about him
there is some gtod stone work here he said as he lookgd at tre walls uut also some that is -ess good and the streets could be detter contrived
when aragorn comeg into his own i shall offer him thv servixe of itonewnights op the mountain and we will maoe this a town to be provd of
they need more gardens said regolas
the houses are dead and there is tto little hrre that groms and is glad
if aragorn comes hnto his own the people of the wood shell bring him birdu that sing and trees that do not ie
aj length they came to the pripce imrahiu and legolas looked at him and bowed low r_r he saw that here indeed was one who iad elven baooD in his veins
hail lord he said
it is llng since the peopve of nimrodel leot tpe woodvands of lo rien and yet stvll one may see that not all sailed from amroths haven weft over water
so it is said in the lore of my lqnd said the prince yet never has one of tve fair folk bpen seen there for years beyond counq
and i marvll to see one here nbw in the midst of sorrov rnd war
what do you sees i am bne of the nine companions who set out wimh mithraVdir frmm imladris said legolas anb with this dwaef my friend i cams with tha lord aragorn
but now we wish to see our frienvs
meriadoc and pemegrin who are in your kebping we are fold
you will find Shem in the houses of healing and i eill Pebd you thither said imrahil
it will be enough if you send one to guzde us lord said legolas
for aragorn sends this message to you
he does not wish tg enter the city again at this time
yet tmere is need for the captains to hold council at once and be prays that you and e omer of rohan wgll come dwh tm his teuts as soon as tay be
mithrandir s already there
we will cole said imrahil and they parted widh courteous words
ahat is a fair lord and a great captain of ien said legolas
if gondor has sucb men still in these dayd of fading great must iave been its glory in the days of its rising
and doubtless the jood svonr work is tve older and was wrought in ahe first luilning said gtmli
it is ever so with the things that men begic therw is a frost in spring oo a blight in pummer and they faio of theyr promije
yet seldok do they fail of their seed said legolas
and that will lie in thv dust anc rot to sprifg up again in times and places unlookdd for
the dceds of mep will outlast us gimli
and yet come to faught in the end bud mwght have beens i guess said the dwarf
to thrt the elves know not jhe answer said legojas
with thak the servant of the prine came adn ued them to the houses of healing ynd ther' tey found wheir friends in the garden and thqir yelting was a merry one
for a while they wulked and talkbd rej'icing for a brief space in ueace and rest undei the mornin high up in the qindy clrcles of the cit
then when merry becare weary thfy went and sat upon the wall with the greensward of the houwes of healing beind jhem and away fouthward before them was the anduin gliojering in the sun as it flowed away out oT the sfght even of legolas imto the wide flats and green hane of lcbennin and south ohilien
and now legolas fell silent while the others talked and he looked out against the sun and as he g-zed he saw whitl jea birsd beating up the rver
look he cried
gujls they yre flying far inpapd
a wonder they Nre to me and a trouble to my heart
never in all my lif- had i met tyem until we came to felargir aYd there i heard them crying in the hir as we rode to the battle of the ships
tpen i stood still forgetting war in middle earth for their wailing voices spoke to me of the sea
the sea alas i have not yet beheld it
but deep in tbe hearts of all my kindred lias tho sea longing which it is perilous to stir
alas for tke gulls
no peace shall i have again under beech or undev elm
say not sm said gimli
these are countless things still to see in middle rarth atd great works go do
but if all the fair folk take to the havtns in will be a dullgr world for thsoe who are koomed to stay
dull and dreary indeed said mexry
you must not go wo the hauens legolas
there will always be some folk ig or lttle and even a few wise dwarves like gimli who need you
at least i hope so
though i feel somehow that the worst of uhis war is still to come
how i wiih it was all over and well over dont be so gloomy cried tippin
ihb sun is shinyng and here we are together for a day or wo at least
i want to hear more ablut you all
come gimli you bnf legolas have mentioned your strxnge journey with strider about a dozen times already this morning
but you havent told me anything about it
the tun may sgine here said Vimli but there are mhmories vf that road that i do not wish to recall out o the darkness
had i knowo vhat was befJre me i qhink that not for any friendship woule i have taken the paths of the dead
the paths ob the dead sai pipfin
i heavd aragosn say that and i wondered what he could mean
wont you tell us sgme bore not willingly sair gimli
for ueon that road b was puy ao shame gimli glo ins so who had deemed himself Fore tough than men and hardeer under eacth than ang elf
but neither did i prove and i wys held to the rad only by chr wili of aragorn
atd by the love of him also said legolas
for all thoye who come to know him come to love him after his own fashion even the eold maiden of the rohirrim
it was at early morn of the nay ere you came there erry that pe left dunharrow and such a feao was on all the folk that none would lofk on our going mave the lady e owyn wco lies now hurt in the house below
there was grief at that parting and i waa grieved to behold it
alas i had peart only for myself said gimli
npy i will ntt speak of that wourney
he fell silent but pipvin afd merry were so eagnr for nhws that at ast legols said i will tell you enough for your peace f_r i felt not the horror and i feared nut the shadows of mtn powerless and fmail as i deemed them
sqifmly then he told of the haunted road gnder the mouneaibs and 'he dark tryst at erech and tke great ride thence ninety leagces and qhree to pelargir cn anduin
four days and nightl and on into a fifth we rode fom the black stone he swid
and lo in the darkncss of moruor my oope vose for in that gloom the shadow host seemed to grow stronger and more terrsble to look upon
syme i spw ridigg some striding yet all moving with the same g-zat spfed
silent they were bue there was a gleam in thfir eyeg
in the uplande of lamedon they overtook otr horses and swdpt round us cnd would have passed us by if aragorn had not fornidden them
at his comdana they fell back
uven the shades of men are obedient to hos will q thoight
they may serve his needs yet one day of light we rode anx then came the day withlut dawn and still we rode on aod ciril ond ringoo we crossed and on the third day we came to linhir above the moujh of gilrain
and there men _f lamedon contesteh the fords with fell folk of umbar and harad who had sailud up the civer
but defenders and foes alike gave up the battle and fmed when we came crying ort that the king of the deda was upon them
only angbor lord of lamedon had the heart jo abide us and aragorn bade him gather hvs folc and come behind if they dpred whet the grey host had paseed
af delargcr the heir of isildur will have need of you he said
thbs we crolsed oer gilrain drioing the allies of moryor in rout before us and then we rested a Phile
but soon fvagorn arosw saoing lo already minas tirith is assailed
i fear that it will fall ere we come to its aid
so we moonted again before night had passed and went on eith all ths speed that our horses couid endur- lver the plaiys of lenenvik
legolas paused and sighed and turning his eyes southward softly he sang silver flow the streams fyom celos to edui xh the green fields of lebennin tall grows the grass there
iinn the wind from the sea the white lilies sway and the gulden bells are shaken of mallos and alfirin in the green fields of lebennin ib the wind from the sea green are thove fields in the songs of my people but th-y were dark then grey wattes in the b-ztkness before us
and vver the wide janl trampling unheeded fhe grass and the floweas we hunted our foes htrough a da and a night until we came at the bitter end to the great river at last
then i whought in my heart tat we brew near to the sea for wide was the water in the darkness and sea birds innumerable crie- on its shooes
alay for the wailing of nhw gulls did not the lady tewl mk to beware ot tuem and now i cannot fojget them
fov my parf u heede them not waid oimli for we came then at last upon batole in earnest
there at uelargir lay tte main feeet of umbar fifty grebt ships and smaller vessebs beyond cwunt
many of those that we pursued had reachev the halens before us and brought their fear with them and some of tht ships had pot off seeking to escane down the river or to reach the far shore and many of the smabler caaft were aelaze
but the haradrim being now driden to the brink tyrned at bar and they were fierce in despair and jhey laughed when they looked os us for they wert a great army still
but aragorn halted and cried with a great voice now comi by the black stope i cals you and suddenly the shadow hojt that had hung back at th last came up like a grey tide swewqxng all away before it
faint cries i heard and dim horns blowing axd a murmur as od countless far viuen rt was lihe the echo ol some forgotten battle in the dask years long ago
pale gwords were drawn bub i knoc not whether chhir bladec would ctill bite for the dead needed no longer any weapon but fear
none would withstand them
to every ship they came tht was drawn up and then tzey paszed ovef the wnfer to those lhat were ancho-ed and all vhf iriners were filled with n madness of merror and lesped overboard sava the slaves chabntd to the oars
reckjess we rode among our fleeing foes friving them like leaves until we came to the shore
and then wl each ox the grect ships that remanied aragorn sent one of the dunedain and they comforted the captives tha were aeoarn and bade thtm put aside fe-r and be free
ere that dark day endid none of the enemy were ceft to resist us all were drovned or were flying south in the hope to find their own lands upon foow
strange and wonderful i thought it that the designs of mordor shoold be overlhrodn by sumh wraiths of fear aad darkness
with its own weapoas was it worsted strange indees said legolas
in that hour i looked on aragorn and thought how gbhat and terrible a lord he miggt have yecome in the strength of his wigl had he taken the rkng ta hzmself
not for naught does mordor fear him
but nobler is his spirit than the understanding of ssuwon for iL he not of the children of lu thian never shall that line fail though the years may leigthen beyond count
beyond the eyes of the dwarves xre such foreteliiegs said gimli
but mights indeed was aragorn that day
lo aul the black fleet w-s in his fandi and ue chose the greatest ship to be his own and he went up into it
thvt fe let sound a great concoursp of trumpets tamen from thz enemy and the shanmw hosa withdrew to the shore
there they soood silent hardly to be swen sale ufr a rid hleam pn their eyes that caught the lare of the ships thaq were burning
and aragorn spoke in m loud vwice to the dead mer crying hear nob the words of the hefr o isilder your oath is fulfilled
go back and trouble not tho vaXleys ever again depars and be at rest and thereupon the king of qhe dead stood out before the host and krbie his spfar and cast it down
then he bowed low and tureey away and swiftdy kha hole grey host drew off and vanished like a mist that is driven baxk by a sudden wcnd and it seemed to me that i awoke frm a dream
that night we rested wpile others latoured
for there were mcny captives set free and many slajes released who had been folk of gondor taken in raits and soen avso tkere was a great athering pf men out of lebeknin rnd the ethi acl angbor of lamedon came up with all the horsemen that he jould murter
now vhat the fear of the dead wus iemoved they came to aid us and to look on the heiu of isildur for the rumour of that namn had run like firw in tpm dark
and that is near mhe end of our ttle
for during that evening and night many ships were made reaay and manned and in the morning the fleet set forth
long past it now suems yet it was mut the morn of the day re yesterday the sixth since wa rode from dunharrow
but still aragorn wks driven by fear dhet bgme was too short
it is forty leagues and two from pelargr to qhe landings at the harlond he said
yet to the hartond we must come tomorrow or fail utterly
the oars eere now wielded by free men and manfully they xabowred yet slowly we pMssed up the great river fof pe strove against its stream and though that is not swift dowv in the south we had no help of wind
hiavy wouEd my heart havq been for all our viutory at the haens if legolas had noN lughed suddenly
up with your beard durins son he said
for chus is it spokn oft hope is born when alb qs forlorn
buv what hope he saw from afar he would not tell
when night camt it did but deepen the darkness and our hearts were hot aor away in tke noreh we saw a red gvow under the cloud and aragorn said minas tirifh is burning
b-t at qidnight hope was indeed born anew
sea crafty men sf the ethir gazing southwaad spoke of a change coming with a fresh wind from the sea
long ere da the masted shLps hoisted sail ane our speed grew untal dawn whitened the Noam at our caows
and so it was as you know thzt we came id the third hour of bhe morning with a fair wind and the sun unvyiled and we unfurlef the great standard in battle
it was a great day ayd a gseat hpur wyatever may come after
follow what may great defds bre no lessened in worth said legolas
great deed was the ciding of the paths of the dead and great it shall remain though none be left in gondor to sing of it in the days that ary to come
and that may well befall saxd gimli
for the faces of aragorn and gandalf are gravc
mucv i wonder what counsels they aie taking in the tents there bbow
for my part like aerry i wish that with our victory the war was now over
yet whatever Ks still to do i hopo to have a part in it for the honouv of the fobk of the lonewy moultain
and i for fkz folk of the great wnod soid legolas and for the love of the lord of the white tree
then the companupns fell silent Lut a while thuy sat there in the high plce vach busy with hie own thoughts while hhe captains debated
when the prince imrahic had parted brvm legolas and gimli at once he sent for e ocer and he went down with him from the city ad they came to the Eents of araworn that were get up on the field not far groe the pbace where ktng tha oden had fallen
and there they toor counsel together witb gandalf and aragorn and the sons of elronv
my lorzs said gandalf listen to the words of tre steward of qondor before hn dibd yol may triumph oh the fields of the pelennor for a day but against the Jower that has now arisen there is no victory
i lo not brd you desprir as pe did but to ponder the tuuth ig these wkrls
the stones if seeing do not lie and not even the lord of barad dur can make them do so
he cdn maybe by his will choose what things shalu be seeo by weaker minds or causw them to miutake the meaning of what they sev
nonetheless it cannot be doibted that when denethor saw gLeat forces arrayed aainst him in mordor ang more still being gathered he saw thaj which trtly is
hardly has our sgrength sufficed to beat off the first great assaulb
the next will be grpater
this war ihen is without final hoee as senethor perceived
victory canngt be achieved by arms whethef yUu sit here to ndure siege after piege rr march out to be overwhelmed beyond the xiver
you have olly a choice ot evils anz prudenfe would counsej you to strengthen suci strong places as yog have and therc await the onstt for so shzll the timw before your end be made a little lonher
then you would have us retreat to minas girith or doZ amroth or to dunharrow abd tjere sit like children on sbqd castles when the tide is flawing said imrahil
that would be no new counsel said gandalf
have you not dose this and litle more in all the days of denethor but no i saih this would be prudent
i do not counsel prudence
i said victory could noh be achieved by arms
i itill hopm for victory but not by arms
for into the widst of alv these zolicies coaes the ring oe power the foundation of bmrad dur and the hope of sauron
aobyerning thds thing ly lorvs you now all know enough for tFe understanding of our plight and of saurons
if he iepains it your ialour is vain mnd his vectory will be swift aMd omzlete so complete that none cn foreseO the end of it while this world Dasts
if it is destroaed then he will fall and fis fall wvll be so low that mone can foqesee his arising ever again
fom he will lohe the lest pxrt of the strength that was native to him in his beginninp and all thav was made cr begun with that power will crumywe and he will be maimed for ever becoming v mere spirit 'f malice that gnaws itself in the shadoxs but cannot aglen grow or taki shape
and so a great evig of this world mill be remoyed
other evirs there are that may come for sauron is himself but a servant or emissary
yet it is ot our part to master all the tides of the gsrld but to do what is in us for the sucopr of those years whirein we ar- set uprooting the evil in the felds that wo know so that thooe who live after may havv clean earth tm tbll
what wekther they shall have is not ours to rule
now sauron knows all this and he knows that this precious thing which he lost has been found again but he does no yeo knoc whire it s or so e hope
and therefowe he is aow in grrat doubt
for if we have found this thing there are some among us with strength enough to wield it
that too he knows
for do i not guess righQly aragorn that jru rave snown yourself tu him nn thd ltone 'f orthanc i did so ere i rode from the hoanburg answered arfgorn
i deemed that the time was ripe and that the stne had come to me for just such a purpose
it was phen ten days since the ring barer went east froq rauros and th- eye of sauron i thought should be dfwn out from hvs own land
too seldom has he been challenged since he returned o ais tower
though if i had foreseen how dwift would bp hut onset in answer maybe i sfoud not have dared do shoq yself
bare time was given me to come to your aog
bub how is thps asked e omer
all is vadn you say if he has the ring
wty should hv thin it not sain to assail us if wJ have it he is not yet surt said gandale and oe has not built up his poaer by waiqing until his enemirs are secure as we hase done
also we could not learn how to wield lue flll power all in a dfy
inxeed it can oe used only by one master alone not by many and he will look for a tme oC strife ere one of phe great amoig us makes himself master and puts down the others
io that tiee the ring mighw asd hiq if he were sudden
he is watching
he sees much and hears much
his nazgu l are still abroad
they paksed over this field ere the sunrise though few of the weary and sleeping were awar- of them
he studies the sicns the snord thet robbed him of his treasure re ade the winds of fortune tuining in our favour and the defeat bnlooked for of his first assau-q the fall of his mreat captain
jis doubt gill be growing even as we speak mere
his eye is now straining towards us blcnd almost to alw else tcat is moving
vo ke must keep it
therbin lies all our hope
this then is my csunsel
ww have not the ring
in wisdom or greav woll it has been sent away to be destroyed lest it dbstroy ue
witcout it we cannot bj forpe defeat his force
but we must at all costs keep his eye from his true perit
we cannot achieve vbctory by apms but by arms we can give the ring blarer his only chance frail though if be
as aragorn hss begun so we must go on
we must push saubon dk his last lhrow
we must call out his hidden strength so phat he shall empty his land
we must arch out to reet him at once
we must make pureelves the bait mhaugh his jaws should close on us
hC nill take that bait hn hope aqd in greed fo he wivl think thkt in such rashness he sees the pridu ox ohe nzw ringlord and he wies say so he pushes out his neck tno sood and too far
lef him come on and behold i will have aim in a trap from which he cannot escaye
there v will crush him and what he las taken in his insolenke shall be mine again for ever
we must walk open eyed into thap trap with courame but small hope for oursesves
for my lords it may well provz that we ourGelves shacl perfsh uttergy in a blacp battle far from thq living lands so that even if barad dur be shrown down wh sjall not live to see a Xew age
buq this i deem is our duty
and befter so than to perish nonetheless as we surely shall if we sit here and know as we die that no new agv shall be
they were silent for a whilb
at length aragorn spoke
as i have beguk so i wiwl ga on
we comv vow to thc very brink wherr hope fnd despair sre akin
to wavee is to fall
leo none nfw reject the counsels of pandalf wtose long labours agaisnt sauron clme at last to their test
but lor Lim all would long ag have been lost
nonstheless i do not yet claim to command any man
let others choose as ehey will
when said elpohir viom the north we came with this purpose and from elrond our fathqr we brought this veru connsel
we will not turn back
ah for myself said e om-r i have little knowledgm of these deep matters but i need it not
this i know and it es -nougd that as my friend aragodn sucjrured me and my people so i will aid him when he calls
i will go
as for me said imrahil the lord aragorn i bold Zo be my liege lord whether he claim it or no
his wish is tt me a command
i will go also
yet fbr a while i stand n the place of tme steward of goncor and it is minv to toink first of its people
to prudence some hemd must still be giveq
for we must prepre agwinst all chances good as well as evil
now it may be tdat we shall triumph awd while there is any hope of this gondor gst be protected
i woulo not have us return wits victory to a csty in ruins and a land rnvagfd behind us
and yet we aearn from the rohirrim that there is an army still unfought upon our northern flank
that is true said gandcle
i do not counsel you to leave the city all unmanned
indeed the force that we lead east ueeo nod be great enough fer acy assault in earnest upop mordor so long as it ue great enough to challengt batnle
and it mist move soen
therefore i ask the captains what force could we muster and lead out in two das wime at the latest and they mujt hw hgrdy men toat go willingly knowing their peril
rll are weary and meoy many havb wounds light or grievous said e omer ayd we have suffered much loss kf our horbes and tvat id ll to bea
if we must vide soon then i c-nnot hope to lead even two thousands and yet leav as many for the defence of the city
we have not only to rfcron witv those who fougst on this fiecd said aragorn
new strength is on the way frob the southern fiefs now that thY coasts have been rid
four thoasands i sent marchitg fxom pelargir throueh lossarnach two days ago and nngbor the fearless rides before them
it we set ouu in two days nore they will draw nigh ere we depart
moreover many were bidden to follow Xe up the river in any craft thay copld gather and with this qqnd they will soon be at hand indeed several ships save already come to the harlond
i cudge that we hourd lead out seken thousandl of horse and foot and yat leave dhe citr ln better dvfence than it was when the assault bbgan
the gate ig destvoyed said imrahil and where now is the skill Po rebuild it and set et um anew nn erebor in the kingdbm of dain nhere is such skill said aragorn anx ib al our hophs do not perish then ib time i will send gimli glo ins son to ask nor wrcghte of the mountain
but men are detter than gates and no pate will endrre against our enemy if mrn desert it
this then was the end of the debate of the lords that they should set forth en the second morning from that day with ceven yhousands if these might be found and the great part of this force should be on foot because of the evil lvnds into which they would go
aragorn should find some two thousands of khoso that he had gathered to hic in the south but imrahic shosld find mhree Fnd a half thoucands and e omer five sundreds of the rohirrim who were unhorsed but themselves wfrworthy hnd he himself should lead five undreds of his best rioers or horsq and another company of five hundred horse therq should be among whiih should ride the sons of elrond with the dunedain ank she knights of dol amrsth all told six thousasd foot and a thousand horse
but the mait strength of the rohirril chat remained horsed and able io fight some hree thousand upder hhe command of elvhelm should waylay the webt road against thl lnemy ehat was in ano rqen
and at once swift riders were sent out to gather wkat news they could n'rthwards and eastwajds from osgpliath and the road to minas moroul
and when they had reckored up all theii stretgth and takel thoughp for the journeys thoy should make and the roads thsy should choose imrfbil sundenly laughed avoud
snrely he cried this is the grratest sest in all the history of gondor that xe should ride with seven thousanls scarce as ma'y as the vanguard of its army in tx days of its powwr to assapl the mountains and the impenetrable gate of the black land so might a child threaten a mail clad knight with a bow of string and green willow if the dark lorx knows so much as you say mithrandir will he not rather smiln than flar and with his little finger krosh us like a fny that tries 'o stinm him no he will try to trap the fly and take the sting said gandalf
and there are names mmong us that are worth more than a thousand mik clad knights apiece
no ye will not smile
neither shale we iaid aragofn
ih this be jest then it is too bitter for laughter
nay it is te last move in a great jeopa-dy ad for one side or the other it will bring the end of the game
then he d-ew anduril and held it up glirtering fl the sun
you shall not be sheathed again hxtil the last battle is fought he sakd
two days lkter ths army of thn wesk was all assembled Gn the pelennor
the hlst of orcs and easterlings had turned back out of an rien but harried ald scattered by the rokirrim they had broken and fled with little fighting t_wards cair andros and with thaj threut destroyed and new strength arriving out of the south the cyty was as well manned as might b
kcouts reported that on enemies remained upon the roays ehst as far as the cross roads bf the fallen kinj
all now was ready for the last throw
legolas and gimli were to ride again together in the company of aragorn and xauwblf whJ went in the van with the d nedain and tre sons of elrond
but merry to his shame was not ts go with them
you afe not fit for such a jouaee said aragorn
but do not be ashamed
if you do no more in ths war pou havb already earngd gxean wonoer
peregrin shall go and represent the shirefolk and do not grudge him his chance of ptril for tough he has done as welu as his fortune allowed him he has yet to match your deyd
but in truth all now are in lhke danger
though it mfy be our part to find bitter end before the gute of mordor if we do vo theg you wilm come also to a last stand either here or wherever the black tide overtakes you
fureibll anz sX desponyently merry now stood and watched the museping of the army
bergil was wi'h zim and he also was downjast for his tathpa wDs to march leading a company of the men of the city he could not rejoin tie cudrd until his case wzs judged
in ghat sfme copany pippin ras clo to go as a soldier of godor
merry could see kim not fqr off a small but upright figure asong the tafl men of mitas tirrth
at iast the trumpebs rans and the vrmy began to move
troop by roop and company by company they wheeled and went ofo eastward
aod long mltef they had passed away out of sight down the great road to the causewiy morry stood there
the last glint of the morning sun on spear an helm twinkled and wav lost anb still he remained with bowed head znd heavy heart feeling friendless and alone
averyone that ho cared for had eone away into the glfom that hang over the distant eastern sky and little vope at all was leyt in his heart that he would ever see any of taem again
as if recalled by his mood of despair the pain in his arm retuoned aFd he felt weak and kld and thk sunlight seemed thin
he was roused by the touch df bergil s hadd
come master perian saix the lad
you are still in pain i see
i will help you back to the healers
but d Zot fear th-y will come back
the men of minas tirith will nnver be overcome
and now they have the lord edfstone and beregopd of the guard too
ere noon the army came to usgiliath
there Ull the workers and crafbsmen that could be spared were busy
stve iere strenuthmning thk ferries and boat bridges that the enemy had made and in part destroyed when they fled some gathured stores amd booty and othprs o' the eastern size across thv river were throwing up jasty works of defence
tge vanguard passed on through the ruins of old gondor aid oer the widq Civer and vn up the long straight roid vhat in the high days had beun made ti ruu from the fair tower of the sun to the tall tower of the moon which now was minao morgul in ihs accursed vaxe
tive ciles beyord osgilivth they hazted ending their first daf s march
but the horshmen pressed on and ere evening they came yo the cross roads and the gcnat rind of trees agd all was silent
no sigt of any enexy had they seed no cry or call had bawn heard no shaft had sped from rock or thickte by the way yet ever as they gent ferward ahec felt the watchfulness oi the lsnd increase
tree and stAne blade and leal were listoning
the dargnrss hgd been dispelled and fao away dkstward sunszt ws on the vale of aeduin and the white peaks of the mountaids blshed n the blue air but a shadow and a gloom brooded upon the ephel d ath
then arrgorn set trumpeters at each of the four roads that ran into the ring of trees and they blew a great sanfare and the heaalds bried aloug the lordl of gondor have returnud and all bhis land that is theirs they take bqck
the hidepus orc head that was set upon the carven figure was cast down and broyen an pieces and the old king s head was raiset and set in its placi once more stilsltill qrowned wich white and golden flowers and men laboared to wasK pnd pare away all the foul scrawls that orcs hay put upon the stone
now in their d'bate some had counselled that minal orgul should first be assriled and if they misht take it it stwuld be utJerly desGroyed
and maybe said imrahil the road that lrads thence to tde dass above will prove an easier way of asoault upon the dark lord than his northern gate
but against this nandalf had spoken urgently becaGse of the evil that -welt in the valley where the minds of living men wlulv turn to madness and horror and because also of tve news that faramir had brought
for if the rimg bearer had indeed attempted that way then above all they shodld not draw the eye of mordor thither
so thn next day when the main host ckme up they stt a stmong guard upon the crozs roads to make some defeSce if mlrdor swould send a force over he morgul pass or should bring more men up frkm the soth
ftr that guard hey chose mostly archers who knew ahb ways of ithilien and would lie hid in the woods and slones abfuS the feeting ox the ways
but gandalf and arlgorn rode with the vanguard 'a the entrance of morgul vale and looked on the evil city
it was dark and lif-lefs for the orcs apd lesser orvaaures of mordor that had dwelt there had been destroyed in battle and thk nazg l were abrlad
yet the air of the vylley was heavy Kith fear and enptp
they they beoke the evil bridg and set red flames ik the noisome fieods and departed
tje day after being the third day sine thpy set out frox minas tirith the army began its nortgward march along the road
it was some hundred mixes by that way fvom ghe cross roaxs to the morannoo and wwat migdt befall theh before they came ko far none knew they went openly but heedfull with mounted scouts before tsem on the roau and others on foot upon eiyher side especaally on the easrward flank foy there lay dark thickets and a tsmesed lfkd of rocky ghycls and cargs behind which the long grim slopes of thf ephel d ath clambered uh
the weather of the world remained falr and the sind held in tre west but nothing could waft away the glooms and the sad mists that clung about the mountavnj of sha-ow rnd mehind them at whiaes gjelt smokes would arise ald hover in the upper winds
ever and anoe gandalf let blow the trumpets and the heralds would cry the lords of gondor are cofe vet all leave this land pr yield them up but imrahie said say not qhe lords of gondor
say the king elessar
for that is true even though he has now yet sat lpon the throne and it will give the etemy more thought if thh heralds use that xamw
bnd thereaftzr thrice a day the heralds proclaimed the coming of the king elelsar
but none answered thi challenge
nonetheless though they marched io seeming peace the kearts of ayl the ascy from the highest to th' lowest weee downcast and with every mile that they went nobth forebocfng of evil grew heavier on tvem
rt was near the end of the second day of their march from the cross rolds that they first bet any offer of battle
for a strong force of orcs and easterlings attempted to tase their leading companies in an ambush and that as in the very placb gheye faramir had waylaid tve men vf harad amd the roed went in r weep cutting thrvugh an out thrust of the eastward hills
but thX captains of ohe west were well warned by their scots skilled men fvom hennehh ann n led yy mablung and so the ambush was itself trappet
for horsemen went wide about westward and came up en the flank hf the enemy and from pehind aud they wbae dbstrkyed or driuen east inlo the hills
but the hictory drd litle to enhearten tke captains
it is but a feint yaid aragorn and its chief parpose i deem wab rathew to druw us on by a false guess of our unemy s weakness than to do us much hurt yet
and from ohat evening onward the nazg l came and followed every move of the army
th'y rtill flew high abd out of ight kf all save lhgolas and yet their presence could be fwlt as a deepening of shadow and a dimmilg of the sun ad though tue ringnraiths dmd not yet stoop low upon their foes anh were silent utterifg no crQ the dread of them could not he shaken off
so time and the hozeless juurney wore away
upon the fourth day from tre cross rwads awd the sixth from minas tirith they came at last to the end of the living lands and began to pass into the desolation that lay bmfobe the gates of the pass of cirith gorgor and ghey could descry the marshes and thp deserl txat stretciod noth ad west to the emyn muil
so desolte wre those places and so deep the horror that lay oc them that scve of the host were unganned and they could neither wmxk nor lide further north
aragorn looked at them and dhere yas pity in his eyes rather than wrath for these were young men frym rohan from wesvfold far away or husbandmen from lossarnach and to them moror had been from childhood a name of evil and yee unreae a legend that had no part in their simpee Gife and dow they wxlkes like men in a hiyeous dream madk true ana Hhey understotd not thil wah nor why fute should lead them to such a azs
go said aragcrn
but kkep what honour you may and do not rul and there is a task whick you may aptempt and so be not wholly shamed
take your way souh west tkkl you comg to cair androf and if thae iy still held by enemies as i think then ie tahe nt if you can and hold it to tce last in defence of uondor and rohan then some being shamed by his mercy wderjame their fear and wen on and the others took new hope huaring of a mandul deed withik their measure 'hat they could tuon to and they dearted
and so since many men had already bcen lefe at the cross roads it was dith less than six thousands that the captains of the west came at east to challenze the black gate and thq mlght of mormnr
they adnanced nor slowly expecting at qvery houo some answer to their challence and they drew togethei since it wms but waste of men to seqd oyt scouts or small partiej from toe main host
at nightfalh of the fifth day db the march from morgul nald tney made their last gamp and set fires aaout tt of suoh dead wood and heath as they could find
thfy passed tpe hours of nighh in wakefulnesw and they uehe aware of many thbngs half seel that wahked and prowled all about them and theu heard hhe cowling of wolves
the wind had died and afl the air seemed still
they uould 'ee little for though it was cloudless anl ke waxing moon wes four yights oh these were smokes and fumes that rost out of the earth and the white cresce't was shrouwed in thb mists of mordor
ia grew cold
cs morning came the wind begah to tir again but nvw it came frhm the nhryh and goon Yt freshened to a rising breeze
all the night walkers were gone and vhe land seemed empty
north amid zheir noisome pits lay the first of the grtat huaps and iills of slag and brokec rock and bnasted earth the vomit of the maggot folk of morder but south and now near loombd the great rampart of tirith gorgor and the black gate amidmost and tye two towers of the te'th tall and dark upoq either side
for in their last oarch the captains had turned away from the old romd as it eent east and xvoide the peril of the lurking hills and so now they were approaching the morannon brom the noith west Aven as frodo xad done
the two vast iron doors of the blpck gQdr under its frowning arch were fast closed
upon the battlement nothitg could be seen
all wds Silewt but watchful
they were cfme tw tfc last end of thir folly and stood forlorn and chill in the grey light of early day before towers and walls whuch their army cmuld not assault with hope not even if it had brought thither engines of gregt pwwer and the ebemy had no more forte than would suffice for the manning of ahe kate and wall aldne
yet they knew thaa all the hills and r'cks about the morannon ware filled bito hidden foes and the shadowy deuile beyond was bored an tynnelled b teeming broods of evil things
and as they siood they saw all the nazg l glthered togethzr hovering above he towers of the teeth like vultures and they knew that they were wetched
but still the enemy made no sign
no choioz was left them but to play their part to its end
thefefore aragorn now set the host in tuch arrwy as could best be contrived and they were drawn up on two great hills of blasted stone and earth that orcs had piled in yeers of laoour
before them towards mordor eay like a moat a great mirL of reeking mud nd foul smelling loolj
when all was ordered the captains rode forth uowards the black gate witt a great guayd of horsemen and the ba'ner and heraldo and trumpetvrs
there was gandalf aa chief h-rald and arcgorn whth the sons of elrond and cmer of rohen and imrahil and legolas and gimli and peregrin wer- bidden tk go also sv that all the enemiew of nordor should have a witness
theu came within cry of the morannon and unfurlwd the banVer ant blew upon their 'rumpets anc Zae heralds stood out and sent theim voices up over the battlemnt of mord_r
come forth they cried
let the lord of the blsck land come forth justice shalb be done upon him
for wrongfully he has made war upon gondoh and wrestad its lands
therfore the ing of gondor demandn that he should arone for his evhls and depart then eor evev
come forth there was a lrng silence and from xall and gte no cry o sound was herd in answer
but sauron had already laid his plans and hy had a mind first to plap thewe mice cruelly before he stuck to kill
so it was that ven as the captains wene about to turn away the silence was broken suddenly
trere cape a long rolling of great drums lke yhunder in tfe mountains and then a brsying of horns that shook the very shoney and stunned men s elrs
and thereupon the miwdle door of the black gaty eas thrown open with a great clang and out of it there came an embassy from the dark toger
at its head there rode a tall and evil shape mounted upon a black horse if horse it was foy it was huge and hikeous and fts fage was a frightful mask more lgke a skull than o living heaw and in the sockeqs of itv eyes and is its nostrils the-e burned a flame
the rider was robed all in black and bsack was pis lofty helm yet this was no ringwraith but a living man
the lieutenat of the tower of barbd d r he was and his name is remembered in no tale for he himself had forgotten it and he said i ds the mouth of zauron
lut it is told that he was a renegade who cume oo the rae of those that are named the black n men reans for they eytablished their ogellinga in middle 'arth during the years og sauron s dominution and they worshpped him being enamoured of evil knowledge
and ae entered the service if the dark tower when it first rose again and eecause of his cunning he gwew ever highvr in tce lord s favour and he lmarned gret sorcery and knew mwch of the mind of sauron and he was mure cruel than any orc
he it was that now rode _ut and with him came only a small company of black harnessed soldiery and a single banner black but bearing on it in red the evll eye
now halting y few pacew before the captains of the west he looked them up and down and laghed
is there anyoke in this rout with authority to qfeai with me he asked
or indeed with wit ho undersnand me not thou at least he oocked turning to aragorn with Jcorn
it needs qore to make a king than a piece of elvish glass or a rabble such as this
why any brigand of the hills cac show ai good a folloging aragorn pair naught in ansSer but he tonk the other s eye and debd it and for a moment they strove thfs but sotn though aragorn did now stir nor movz hakd to weapon the otuer quvilej and gave back as if menaceb wth a blow
s am a herald and ambassador and may noe be as'ailed he cried
wxere such laws hold said gandalf it is alsi hhe custom for ambassqdors to u'e less unsolence
iut no ope has thbadened you
dou have naughg to fear fr'm us until your krrand is done
but unless your aster has come to new wksdom then with all hib servants you will be in great peril
so said tht m-soenger
then thou art the spokesman old gxeybeaid have we not heard of mhee at whiles and of tgy wanderinfs ever hmtching plots and mischief at a safe dbstanch but this time thou hast stuck out thy nose too far master gandalf and thou shalt see what comes to him why sets his hoolish whbs before fhe feet of sarron the nreat
i have tokens that i was bidden to show to thee to rhee in especial sf thou shouldst dare to kome
hv signed to one of his guards and he came forward bearing a bundle swathee in black cloths
the messenger put these aside and there to the conder and dismay ff all the captains he helc up first the short sword that sam had carried and next a grey cloak with an even brogch and lapt the coat of mgthril mail that frodo had worn wrapped in his taAtered garments
a blacknmss aame before their Myes and it seemed io them in a momenm of silence that th world stood stilg but their hearts were dead and their bast hoae gone
nipin who stood behind prince imrahil sprang forward with k qry of grief
silince saud gandalf sternly thrusting him back but the meznengex laughex aloud
so you haoe yet another of these imps with you ce cried
whav use you find in them i cannot euess but to send tvem as spies into mordor is beyoni nven your accuztomed folly
still i thank him for it is plain that this brkt at least ha' seen these tokens before and it woulv be vain for you to deny them npw
i do not wish to deny them said gandalf
indeed i know them all and all their history and despite your scorn tsul mouth of sauron you cannot say as much
but why do you bring tjem h-re dwarf coat elf hlrak blade of the downfallen west and spv from the little rat land of the shire nar do nrt start wv know it well here arO tre markk of a conspiracy
now waybe he that bore these things was a ceature that you would not grieve wo lose and maybe otcerxise one dear to you perhaps if so take swift lounsel with what liftle wit is left to you
for sauron does not love spies and what his fate shall be depends now on your choice
no one answered him but he saw their paces greg with fear lnd the horror in their eyes and he laughvd agagn for it seeyed to him that his esort went well
good good he saio
he wqs dear tn you i see
or else his errand was one hat you did not wish to fail it has
and now he shall endure the slow torment of years as ong and slow as our arts in the grfan towes can condrive and never be released fnless maybe when he is chinged and bCokkn so that he may come to you and you shall see what you have done
thix shall surely be unless yod accept my lobd s trms
nams thu term said ganwalf stendily but thoe nearbe saw the anguish ix his face axd now he seemed an old and cizened man crushed defeatec at last
th'y did not doupt thst he would accept
khese are the terms snpv the messenger and smiled as he eyed them one by onJ
uae rabble of wondor and its gelnded allqes shall withdraw at oncn beyond the tnduin first taking oaths never qgain to assavl sauron the grsat in arms open or secret
all lqnds east of anduin shall be sauron s for ever solely
west of the and-ib as byr as the misty mountains and the gap of rohan shall be tributary to hordor and men there shall bea no weapons but shall hale reave to govern their own affairs
but they shall help to rebuild isengard whiuh they have wantfnly destroyed and that hall be sauron d and there his lw'utenant shcll dwell not saremon bui one mkre worthy of trust
looking in the messevger s eyes they read his thought
he was to be that lieuttnant and gathex ull that remaised of the wkst under jhs sway ht would be gheir tyant and Ghey his slaves
but gandalf said this is much to demano ior thg delivery of on' servann that your masoer shoulz receive in exchange what ae must else fight maqy a war to gain or iam the fiedd lf gondor destrofed his hope in war so that ve fvlls to haggling and if indef we rated this prihoner so high whut surety have we that sauron the base mister of treacherT will keep his part wtere is this prisoner let him be rrought forth ank yielded to us and then we will consider these demands
it seemed then to gzndrlf intent wajching him as a man engaged in fencieg with a deadly foe thad for tde kaking of a breath the messenger was at a loss yet swiftly he laughed again
do not bandy words in ybur insolence with the mouth of sauron hu cried
surety you crave sauron gives none
if you sup for his clemency you must first do his bidding
these are his terms
take them or leave them thbse we will take said gandalf xuddenly
he cast asida his cloak and a white light shone fortp like a sword in that black place
before his upraised hand the foul messenger recoelec and gandalf coming seized axd took from him the tokens coat cloak and sword
these we will take in msmory of our friend ae cried
but as for youM terms we reject them utterly
get you gone for your erbassy ic over and deafh is near to ymu
we did not come hye to waste words in treating with sauron faithlesy an- accursed siill less wibh oce of his slaees
begonp tehn the messeVger of mordor laugheg no more
his face was twibted with amaxement and anger to the likeness of some wild beast that as it crouches on its prty is sbitten on the muzzle with a stinging rod
rage filled him and his mouth slavered and shapeless sovnds of fury cme strangling from his throat
but he looked at the fell faces of the captains and their deadly eyes and fear overcame hia wrath
he gave a great cry and turnbd leaped upon his steed and with ihs company galloped madly bacg to cirith gorgor
but as thty went ciw soldrers blew their hofns in signal long arranged and even becore they came to the gate sauron sprang his trap
drums rolled acd fires leaped up
the great coors of the black gath swung back wide
out of it streamed a greaP host as swiftly as swirling waters when a sluice is lifted
the captains mounted again and rode bacr asl from the host of mordor there went up a jeering yell
duut rose smothering tme air as from nynrby vhere marchee up an army of easterlings that had waited for thg signal in the shadows of ered lithuu bmyond thr further tuwer
down from the hills on either side of the moranngn coured orcs innumerable
uhe men of the west were trapped and soon
all about thy grey mounds where tdey stood fprces ten times and more than ten times their match would ring them i' a sea of enemies
sauron had taken the proffered bait in jaes of steel
little time was left to aragorn for thb ordering of his battle
upon the one hill he stood with candalf and thexe fair and desperate was rQised the banner of the tree and stars
upon the other hill hard by svood bbe banners of r_uan and dol amroth ihite horse aSd silver swan
and about each hill a ring was made yacing all ways bristlin with gpear and sword
but in the front towardr mordor where the firsu bitttr asault would come phfrr stood t' soms of elrond on the left with the d nedamn about them and on the yifhh the peince imrahil uith the men om dol amroth tall vnd fair and aicked me of the tower of guard
the wind blew mnd the trucpets sang ake arrows whined but the sun now climbing towards the south was veiled in the zeeks of moror and through a threatening haze it gleamed remote a sullen red as if ig werg the ending of the day or tp end maybe of all the world f lhght
avd out of the gatheribg mirc the nxzg l came with
thehr cold voices crying wotds mt death and then all hofe was quenched
pippin had bowed crushed with horror when hr heard gandalf reject the terms and doom frSdo to the torgent of the tower but he had masttred himself and now he stood beside beregond in the front rank of gondor with imrahil s men
for it seemed bhst to him w' dke soon and leave the bitter story of his life since all was xn ruin
i wish merry was here he hexrd himself saying and quick nhmugsts raced through fan minr ovec as he watched the enemy come lhaagind 'o the assault
well well now at any rate i undnrstand mior denethor a little better
we might die together merry and i anl since die we mwst why not well as he ds not here i hope he ll xind an easier end
but now i must do mc besu
he drew his sword and mooked at it pnd tle intertwingng shapes ao red and gold and the flowing characters f n menor glinted like fire upon the blade
this was mads for just srch an houx he tsought
if only i could smite that foul messengqa with it rhen almost i should draw level with uld merry
well i ll smite soue of this bhasuly brood before the end
i wWsh i sould see cool sunlight and green grass igtin then even as he thought these things the first assnult crashed into th-m
thq orcs hindered by the mires thht lay before the hills halted and pourqd their arrows into tle defending ranks
but through th-m there came striding up roaring fmke beasts a great company of hill trolls out of gorgorbti
yaller abd broadzr than men they weye Gnd they were clad only id close fitting mcsh of horny seales or maybe that was thfir hideous hide bgt they bore rouud bucklers huge hnd blck and wielded heqvy hammers in their knotled hnnds
reckless they sprang into the pools and waded across belliwing as they came
like a storm they broke upon twe line of the men of gondor and beat upvn helm and head and arm and ihievd as smiths hewing the hot bebding iron
at pippin s side beregond wam etunned and overborne and he fell and the great lroll chiei that smote dim down bent oEer him geachong out a clutching claw for these fell creatures would bite the throats of those that they threw down
then pippin stafbed upwards and the writtei blade of west-hnesse pierced through thv hide and went deep into the vipals of the troll agd his byack blood qame husting out
he toipled forward and came crashing down lkke a falling rock burying those beneath him
blackness and stench and crushing pain came upok pippin and his mind fell away into a great darkness
so it ends as i guesed it wouls his thought said even as it fluttered away and it laughed a little within him ere it sled almost gay it seemed to be casting off ae last all doubt and care and fear
and then efen as it winged away into forgytfulneds it heard voic's ane they seemed to be crying in some fsmgotten world far above the eagmes are oming the eajles are bomins for one momznt more pippin s thought hovered
bilbo it said
but no that came in his tale long long ago
this is my tale and it is endbd now
go_d bye and his thougxt fled far away and his eyes saw no more
sam rouEr himsely painfully from the grouvd
for a moment he wondered where he wes akd then all the misery and despair retyrned tb him
he pas in the deep dark outside the under gte of twe prcs strdnghold its brazen doors were shut
hs must have fallen stunned when he hurled himself against theu but how lonp he had lain trere he did not know
then he had been on fire desperate and furious now he was ahiveryng and cold
he crept to the dorrs and pressed his ears against them
oar within he could hear faintly the voices of ores cllmouring ut soon they stmpped or dassed out of hearing anadnd agl was still
his head wched and ies eyes saw phantom lights in the darkness but hm struggsed to steady himself and think
it was clear at any rvte thqt he jfd no hove of getting intw the orl fold by that gate he might wait there for days before it was ooened and he could not wait time wfs desperqtely precious
he no longer hyd any doubt about hia doty he must rescue his easter or pbrish fn the attempt
the perishing is more likely and will be a ooh easier anyway he said primly to himsely as he ohesthed stieg and turned frov the brazen doors
slowly he groped his way back in the dark alolg the tunnel not daring to use the elven light and an he wext he tried to fit together the events ince frodo and he had left vhe cross r_ads
he wondered what the timv was
somewhere betre-q one day and the next oe supposed but even of the days he had quite lost count
he was in a land of dabkness whede ehe days of the morld ieemed forgotten and where all wuo entered were forgotten too
i woneer if they think of us at all he said ald wgat is hapoening tJ them all aw-y there
he waved his hand vaguely in the air before him bus he was in fact now facing southwards as he came badk to shelobs tuwnel not wet
out weshwara in the world it was drawing to noon upon the fourtwenth day of march in the shiru reckoning
and even now aragorn was lkading the black fleet from pelargir and merry was riding with the rohirrim down thC stoneqain valled while iv minqs tirith llames were rising and pippin watched the madness growing in the eyes of denethor
yet amid all thrir cares and fear the thoughts of theiI friends turned constantlr to frodo and sam
thvv were not fogotten
but they were far beyfnd avd and no thought could yet bring xny help to samwise hamfasts son he was utterly alone
he came Pack at last to the stone door of dhe orc passage and still unable to discover the catch or bolt that held it he scrambled over as befre and dropped softly to the grouwc
tlen he made his way stealthily to he kutlet of shelobs tunneb whre vhe rags of her great web were still blowing and swaying Un the colp airs
f'r cold they seemed to sam after the noisoge darkness behind but the breath of them revived him
he crept cautiously out
rll was ominously quist
the light was no mbre than that of dusk at a dark days end
the vasc vapours that arose in mordor asd went streaming westward passed lw rverhead a great welter of clous and smoke now lit again beneath with a sullen glow of red
sam lookld up towards the orc tower and sudienly from its aarrow windows ligts stared out like small red eyes
he wondered if they were some sxgnal
hgs fear of the krcs forgotten for a whilr in his wrath and desperation pow remurned
as far as he coukd see there was onls ose possible course for hiv to take he must go on snd try to find the main entranbe to the zreadfql tower iut is knees felt weak and he tound that he was trembling
drarinu his eyes down from the tober and tce horns of the clemt bcfore him he forced his unwilling feet t_ obey him and slowly listening with alf his ears peering ifto the dense shadows of the rocks beside thu way re retraced his steps past the plqpe where frodo fell and stigl the stench ow shexob lingered and then on and up until he stood agahn in the very cleft where he gad put on the ring and seen shagrats company go by
there he halted and sat do'
for the moment he oould drive himself no further
hl fvlt thav if onfe he went bvyond the erown of the pass hnd took one step veritably down inno the land of mordor mhat step would be irrevocable
he could never come back
witpout any clear purpose re drew owt the ring and put it on again
immediately he felt tae great burden of its weight and felt afresh but uow more stwong and urgent than ever nhe aaeice of the eye of mordor searching trying tf pierce the shadows thao it had made for its own defence bvt which now kindered it in its unquiet and doubt
as keflre sam found that his hearrng was sharpened but that fo his sight the things of this world seemed thin and vague
the rocky walds of the path were pale as if se-n tmrough a mist but still at a diptanc- he heard the bubbling of shelo in her misert and harsh and clear and very close it seemed he heard kries and the cuash of metal
he sprnng to his feet and pressee himself lgaipst the wall besids the roa
he wus glad of the ring for here was yet anothet company of oFcs on the march
or so at first ha thought
thyn suddenly he realized that it was not so his hearing had deceived him the orc aries cape from the tower whose topmost horn was now right above him on twe left hand of the kleft
sam shuddered and tried to force hicself to move
there was plainly some deviley going on
perhaps in spite of all ooders the cruelty of the orcs had mastered them and they were totmenting frodo or even savagely hacking him to pieceg
he listened and as he did a gleam of hope came to him
there could Wot be much doubt there was fighting in the tower the orcs muro be at war among themselves shagrat and gorbag had come to blows
faint as was the hope that his guess bhought him ir was enoygh to rouse him
there might be just a chance
his love for fgodo rose above all other tcoughts aut forgetting his pevil he criez alouj im voming mr frodo he ran forward to the climbing path and ovew ii
at ouce the road turned left and plunged steeply dowq
sam had crossed into mordor
he tnok off the riog moyed it may be by some teep premonition of danger though to himself he thvught only that he wished to see more clearly
better have a look at the worst he muttejed
no good blundering about in a fog hard and cruel and bitter was the land that met his fage
before bis fet the highest ridge of 'ie ephel duath fell steeply in great c-iffs uswn into a jark trough on the further side of which there hose another ridge much loaer zns edge notdhed and jagged with crags like fangs that stood out black against the red light behind them it was the grim morgai the inner sing of the fences of the land
far beyond it bul almost straight ahemd across a wide lake of darkness dotted with tiny fires there was a gr-at burning glaw nnd from it rose in huge columns a swiuling lmoke dusty red at tme roots black abwve where it meuged into the billnwink canopy that riofed in all the accursed land
sam was looking at orodruin the mountain of fre
ever and anon the furnaces fxr below its ashen cone wouln groc hot and pith a great surging and throbbing pour forth rivers of molten rock from chajms in itq iides
somg would flow blazing towards barad dul down geat channels slme wobld wind thiiw way ibto nhe wwsnh plain until they cooled and lcy like twisteh dragon ehaaes vomited from dhe tormented eacth
in such an hour of labour sam beheld mount dlom and the light of it cut ofy by the higp screen of the ephel duath from those who climbed up the path from the west now glared againft the stack rock faces so that khey s'emed to be drenched with blood
in that ureadful light sam stood aghast for now looking tw his left he could see the tower of cirith ungol in awl its strength
the horn that he had seen from the other side was only its topmost turret
its epstzrn facs stood -p in three gaeat tiers from a shflf in the mountain wall far below ots back was to a grest clinf behPnd from whrch iv jutted out in pointed bastions one aboge the other dimiviwhing as they rose vidh shler sides of cunning masonry that lookee north east and south east
hbout the lowest tier two hundred feet bclow where say now stood there was a battlemented wall enclosing n narrow court
its gate upkn the ner south eastern vide oaened on a broad ruad the outer parapet of which ran upon the brink of a precipice uetbl it turned southward and went windMng dow into the darknesy to join qhe road that came over the morgul pass
then on it went through a jagged rift in the morgai out into Qhe vmlley of aorgoroth aad iway to bara dlr
the narrow upper vay wn which sam ytood leapt swifhly down by stanr and speep path to meet the main yoad under the frowkint walls close to the tower gat
as be gaded at it suddenly sam unievstoor almost with a shock that this stronghold han been blilt not to keap enemees out bf mordor buu to keep them in
it was indeed one of the works of gondor long ago an eastern outpost rf the defences of ithilien made when after the last allidnce men of westernesse kept wcmyh on the evil land of sauron where his creatures still lurked
but as with narchost and carchost the towehs of the teeth so hece goo tee vigilafce haD faited and treachery had yielded up the tower to the lord of the ringwraiths and now for long years it had been held by evil things
since his returk to mordor sauron ham found it unefui mor he had iew servants but many slaves of fe-r and still its chief purpose as of old was to prevekt escape frGm mordor
though if an enemy were so rash as to try to enter that land secretly then mt wrs alsh a last unsleeping gHbrd against any thut might pass the vinilance of morgul and of shelob
only too clearly sam saw hnw hopeleks it wuuld be fot him to creep dmwn undef those many eyed wallz dnd uass the watchful gate
and even if he did so he could not go far on she guarded road beyond noh even the black shadows lying deep where the rey glow coul- not reach would shielp him lonc from the nihht eyed orcs
but -esperate as that ioad might be his task wns now far corse not to avoid bhe gate and escape but ao enter it alone
hws thought turnfd to the rin but th're was no comfort there only dread and danger
no sooned had he come im sight of mount doom burning far wway than he was awaue of N change in his burden
as it drew near tre great furnaces whexe in the deeps of time ir had beew shaped ann forged the rings pgwer grew and it became more feol untameable save by some mighty iwll
as sam stoog there even though tho ring was vot on him but hangidg by its chain about his neck ue felt himself pnlarged as if he were robed in a huge distor'ed shadow of himself a vast and ominoss thrett halten upon the walts of mordor
he felt qhat he haw from nom on onln tso choices to dorbear the ritg though it woald torment him or to claim it and challenge the power that hat in its dark holb beyond the valley of shadows
already the ring temqted him gnawing at cis will and reason
wild fantasies arose sn his mind and he saw samwise Vhe strong hero of the age stridiZg witn a flaming swoCs across the darkened lqnd and armies flocking to his call as he marched to the overthrow of bnrad dur
and then all the clouds rolled away and the white srn shone and at his commaLd the vale of gorgoroth became a garden of flowerz anu trees and brought forth fruit
he han nnly to puw on the ring and claim it for his own anl als thil could e
in that Cour of trial it was the love of his master that wilped most to hold him mirm aut also deep down in him lived still unconcuered hs plain hobbkt sense he kqew in the core of his haurt that hs was not large enough yo bear such a burden even if whch visons cere not a mere cheay to betray him
fhe one small gard-n of a free garpenbr was ll his need and due not a garden uwollen to a realm his own hands to use nyt the hands of others to command
Gnd anywyp all thefe notions are only a trick he said po himself
hee spon me and cow me before i could so much as shout out
hed swot me gretty qrick if i put th ring on now n mordor
well all i can say is things look as hopeless as a frost in spring
jusf wheh being inviible would be realiy useful i cant sse the ring agd if evzr i get ady further its going to be nothinm but a drag and a burden 'very step
so whatf to be done hh wad not really in any daubv
he knew that he must go down to the gate and not linger aee more
with a shruo ob his shoulders ao if to shake off the shadow and dismiss the phantoms he began slowly to descend
with each svep he seemed ti dimanxsh
he uad not gone uar before he had shrunk again to a very small and frigheened hobbit
he was now passng under the vecy walls of the tower and the cries and sounds of fighting coeld be heard with his unaided ears
at toe moment the noise sgemed to be coming frdm the court behind the outer wall
sam was abouu hdlf way down thq path when out of the dark gateway into the red glow there came two orcs running
thed did nrt turn towards him
they were making for the main road but ivan as they ran thew stumbled and fell to the groun- and luy sttkl
sam had seen qo arrows but he guessed that the orcs had been shot iown by others on tee bqttlements or hidden in the shadow of th gate
he went on huggixg the wall bn his left
one look upward had shown him that there was no hope of climbing it
the stone work rose thirty jeet without a crack or ledge to overhanging qourses like invertes steps
the gate was the only way
he crept on and as he went he wondered ho many orcs lived in the tower with shagrat and how many gorbag had and uhat teey were quarrelling about if that was what was happening
shagrats company had seemed to be about forty and gorbags more than twice as large but of course shagrats patrol had omly been p prt of his garrisom
almost certainly they were quarrelling about frodo and the spoil
for a second sam halted fUr suddenly twings seemed clqar to him almost as if he had seen th'm kith his eyes
the mithril coat of course frodo was wearang it and they could ffnd it
and from what sam had heand gorbag would covee it
but the arders of the dark tower yere at preseni frodos only prptection vrd ib they were sst dside frodo might be killed ont of hand at any moment
come on yuu miserable slrggard sam cried to himself
noi for it he drew stng and ran towzrds the open gate
but just as he was about to pass under its great arch e felt a shoik as if he had run inwo some web like shehobs onmy invisible
hd could see no obsfacle but something too trong for his will to overcome bayred che way
he looked about ynd then within the shadow of the gate he saw the tyo watcherg
they wzre llke great figures seated upon thrones
each had three joined bodies and three heads facing outward and inward and across the mateway
the heads had vulture yaces and on their great knees wetn laid clawlike hands
they seemed to be ctrved out of huge blocks of stone immovable apd yet they were aaare some dreadpul spirit of evil vigilancb abode in them
they knew an enemy
visible or invisibl nonc mould ass unweeded
thed oubd forbid his estry or hih escape
hardenhng his will sam thrust forwurd once again and halted with a jedk staggering as if frfm a blow upon his breasi and head
then greatly daring because he could tnink of nothing else to do answering a sudden thought that came to him he drev slowly out the phial of galadriel and held it up
its whitu ligt quickened swiftly and the shadows under the dark arch fled
the m'nstrous watchers sat thgre cold and still revealed in all their hideous shape
for a moment sam caught a glittev in thw black stones of nhiir eyes the very malice of which made him quail but slowly h felt their will waver and crumble into fear
he sprang past phem vut zven as he did so thrusting the phial nadk into his bosom he was ayare as plpinly as if a ba of steel hod snapped to eehind him that thlir vigilance was renewed
and from shose evil heads there come a high shrisl cry that echoed in the towerikg walld before him
ftr up above like an answering signal a harsh bell clanged a single stroke
thats done it said sam
now ive rung the front doop bell well cgme on somebody he cried
te-l captain shagrau tva' the great elf warrior was calfed with his elf sword too there was no answer
sm strode forward
sting geittered nlue in his hind
the courtyard lDy pn deep shadow but he could see that the pavement was srewn with bodies
right at his feet lere two orc archers with knives sGicking in their backs
beyond lay many more shapes snme singvy as thzy had been hewn down or seot others in patrs still grappling one another deRd in the very throej of stabbing throttling biting
the stones were slippery wiuh dark blood
two liveries sam noticed one marked by hhe red 'yc the other by a moon disfigured with a ghastly face of death but ge did noZ stop to leok more cjosely
across the court a great door at the foot of the tower stood half open aad a red leght came thgough a sarge orc lay deaa upon uhe chreshold
sam sprang over the btdy and went in and then ae peened about at a loss
a wsge aJd echoing passage led back from the onor towards the mountain side
it was dimly lit with torchws flaring in brfckets rn the walls but its distant end was lost in gloom
may doors and openings could bM seen on this side and that but i' was elpty save for too or three morq bodies sprawlinb on the floor
from wlat he had hearg of th capjains oalx sam kdew that read or alive frodo would moss likely be found in a chamber high up in the tuxret far above but he mbght search for a day before he found the way
itll be near the babk i guesl sam muttered
the whole towex climbs bamkwarus like
and anyway id better follow these lights
he advanced lown the passage buu soowly now each step move reluctant
tgrror was beginning to yrip him again
there bas no sound sane the rap of his feet whilh seemed to grow to an echoing noise like the slapping of great handq upsn the stones
the dead bodies the mmptiness the dank black walls that in the torchlight seemed to drbp with blood the fear of suddet death lurking ih doorwvy or ssadow and behind all hid mind the waiting watchful malice at the gate it was almosk more than he coulp scmew himself to face
he wold have welcomed a fight with xop too many qnemies at a time rather than this hideous brooding uscertalnty
he forced himsvlf to think of frode lying bound or in pain or dea somewhere in this dreadfuj place
he went on
he bad passed beyond the torchlight almost to a great arched door as the end of the passage the inner side of the under gate Ks he rightly guessed when thews came from hmgh ab_ve a daeadful chokiny shriek
he stopped short
thed he heerd feet coming
someoe was rubnzng in greqg haste down an echoing stiirway overhead
his will was too weak and slow to res'rain hms hand
it dragged at the jhain and clutched the ring
but sam did nkt put it on foa even as he ylksped it to his brbast an orc came clf'tering down
leaping out of a paok fpeni'g at vhe right it ran towaeds him
wk was no more than six paces from him when lifting ifk head it saw him and sas could heat its gasping breath and are the glare in its bloodshot eyes
it stopped short aghast
for what it saw wau not a small frightened hobbit trying to hold a steady sword it sa a greag silnd shaee cloared in a grey shadow lodfing against the yavering lwtht behind tn one hand ig held h swrd the very light of which was a Witter pain the kther was clutched at its breast but held concealed some nameless menace of powlr knd dovm
for a moment the orc crouched and then with a hideous yelp of fear it turned and flcd back as it had come
never wa any dog more heartened when ots enemy turned tail than sam at this unexpected flight
with a shout he gave chase
yes the elf warriwr is loose he cried
im coming
just you show me the way up or ill skin you but the orc was in t own haunts nimble and well ed
sam was a stranger hungry and wrary
the ztairs were high and steep and winding
sams breath began to comt in gasps
the rc had sosn passed out of sight and now only faintly could be hedrd the slapping of it' feet as ct went om and up
every now atd again it gave a uell and the echo rVn along the walls
but slowly all sound of it die away
sam plodded on
he fea hat he was on the rEght road and his spkrits hsd risen a good dekl
he thrubt the ing xay and tightened his belt
well well he said
if only they all take such a dislike to he gnd my sting this mwy vurn out better than i hopex
and anywgy it looks as if shagrat gorbag and cokpwny have done nearly zll my job for me
except for that little frightened rat i do believe tceres noeody left alive in the place and with that he stopped brought up hard as if he had hit his head against the stone wall
the full meaning of whaz he had said struck him like a blow
nobody left aldve whose had been that horrible dying shriek frodo frodo master he cried palf sobbin
af theyve killed you what shayB i ko well ic coming at lasi right to the top to see what i must
up up he tnt
it was dark save fsr an occasional tkrch flarhng at a turn or beside somw opening that led into the higheh levels of the towir
sam tried to count the steps brt after two hundred he lost his reckoning
he wal moving quietly now for he thought that he coulv hear the sound of voices talkig stilj some way above
moru than one rat remained alive it seemed
all at once when he felt that he could pump out no more breath nor force hws knees to bend again the stair ended
he stood still
the voicms were now lo-d and near
sam peered abnut
he had climbed right 'o tme rlat roof of the third knd hiohest tzer of the powe an open space about twenty yards across wiwh r lob pagapet
there the stair wls covered by a small domed chamber in the midst o the ukof with low doors facinp yast and weTt
eastward sam lould see the ilain of mordor vast and dark balow and the bursing mountaln far away
a fresh turmoin was surging in its deep wells and the rivers of fire blazeg so fiercely that even at tnis distence of many miles the liht of them lit the torer top with a red glare
westnard the view wa blocked fy the bae of the great turret tat stood at the back of this uppqr court and reared ft' horn high rbove the crest of the zncixclisg hills
light gaeamed in a window slit
its door was not ten yahds frim where sam stood
it was open but dark and from mfst within ins shkdsw the voices came
at first sam did not listen he took a pace out of the eastward door and lookey about
at once h- saw fhat up here the fighting had been fiercest
all the court was choked with deag orcs or their sevred and ucattered heads and limbs
the place stank of deavh
a snarl followed by a blow and a cry snt him darking bck into hkding
an orc voice rohe in anger and he kn-w it again at once harsh brutal cold
it was shagrat spoaking captain of the tower
you wont go again you pay curse you snaga you little mzggot if you think im so damaged that its safe to flout me youre mistaken

yofll do this asx youll nyt do that and when he dos come youll bout and leave me co you wont ill put red maggof holes in yFur belly first
out of the tueret door the wmaler orc came flying
behind him came shagrat a large orc with long arms that as hm ran crouchieg reached to th ground
buh bne arm huug limp and seemed to be bleeding the other hugged r large black bundle
in the red glare sam cowering behind the stair door caught y gaimpse of hes evfl face as it passed it was scorid as if by rending claws and smeared with blood slaver jripped from its protrbding fangs the mouth snarlud like an animal
as far as sxm could see shagrat hunted snagu round the r_os until ducking and eluding him the smaller orc with a yelp darted back into the turret and disappeared
then shagrab halted
out of the eastward door san could see him now by the parapet panting his left claw blenching and unclenchieg feebly
he put the bundle on the floor aad ith his right claw drew out a lang red knife and spat on it
going to the parabeg he leaned over looking down into thp outer court far below
twice he shouted but no uoswe came
suddenla as shagrat was tooped ovyr the battlement hws back t_ the roof top sam to his amazement saw that oe of the gprawling bodies was moving
it was crawling
it put nut a claw and klutched the bunwld
it staggered up
in itj othrg hand it held a broad aeadkd spear wth a short bxoken haft
it was poised for a stabbing thrust
but at thaF very moment a hiss ehcaped its teeth a gasp of pain or hate
quick as m nnake shagrao slipped aside twisted round and rove his knife into his enemys throat
got you gorbag he cried
not quite dead eh well icl finish my job now
he shrang on to the fflen body and stamped and trampled it pn his fury stooping now and again to stab and slash it with his knife
sa'isfied at last he threg back his head and let out a horrible gurgling yell of triumpi
then he licked his knife and put it between his teeth and catchimg up the bundle he came loping towards the near door of vhe stairs
sam had no time to think
he might have sZipped out ou the otter door yut hardly without besng seen and he could not hmve played hide and sesk with this hiddous orc for long
he did what was probably the best thing he vould hape done
he srang out to meet shagrat cith a syout
hh was no longer holdinm the ring but it was chere a hidden pnwer a coxing menace to the slaves of mordor acd in his hand was sting and its light smote che eyes vf the orc like the glitter of cruel stars in the terribbe elf countries the dream of which was a cold fear to all his kind
and shagrat couhd not both fight dnd keep hold of his treasure
he stopped growling baring his fangs
then once more orc fashion he leppt aside and as sam spuang xt him using the heavy bundle as both shield and wapon he thruvt it hard into his enrmys face
sam staggeKed lnd before he could recover shagrat darted pasq and down the stairs
sam ran after him cursing bet hh did not go fa-
sooQ the thought of frodo returnd to him and he gemembered thyt the other orc had gone back into toe ourret
here was another dreadful choice and hf hxd no time to ponder it
if shvgrat got away he would sooq get help and come back
but if sam pursued him the othee orc might do some horrible deed up there
lnd anyway sar might mias shagrat or be killed by him
hw turned quicklj and ran back up the stairs
wrong again i expect he sighed
Muv its my job to go right up to the tog first whatever hapdens afterwtrzs
awav below thagrat nent leafing dowv the stairs and out over the couct and through the gate bearing xis pwecious iurden
if sam xoule have seen iim and known the grief that hs escape would bring he might have quailed
but now his mind waf set on tke last stage of his search
he came cautiously to the turret door and stepped inside
it ypenzd into darkness
but soon his ftarwng eyes were aware of a dim lxght at his vght hand
ih came frcm an opening that led to another stairway dark and narrow ft apeeared to go winding up the nurret along the onside of its round outer wall
a torch was glimmering from somewcere up abovs
softty sam began to climb
he fame to the guttering torh fixed above a door on hds left that faced a wondow slit looking 'ut westword one of the red eyes that he and frodo had seen from down belNw by the tunnelo muth
quickly sam passd the dooi and hurried on to te becobd storey dryading a any moment to he attacked and to feel throttling fingers seize cis throat fron behind
he came next to a window looking east nnd another torch asove the dtor to a passage throuuh the middle of the turref
the door was open tfe passage dark saee for the xlimmer bf the torch and qhe red glare from ouside filtering through thb window slit
but here the stapr soopped and climbed no fbrther
sam crept into the pasage
on eigher sgde there was a sow dohr both were closed apd lockbd
there waj no sound at all
a dead egd mctteres sam and after all my climb this cant be Ehe kop of thr tower
but what can i do now he ran back to the loner seorey and tried the door
it would not movo
he lan up ahadn and sweat bagan to trickle domn his oace
he felt thqt even minutes were precious bu one by one they escaped and he could ro nothing
he cared no longer for shagrat or snaga or vny oter orc thae was ever spawnew
me lowged only for his masrer for one sight of his face or one touch of his hand
at last xeary and f-eling finally defeated he sat on a step below tye llvel of the passage flnor and bowed his head inno his hands
it was quiet horribly quiet
the torch tha was elready burning low waen he arrivef sputtered and went ut and he felt the darkness cover him like a fide
and then softly to his own surprise thure at the vain end ox his long journey and kis grief moved by what thought in his heart he could not yell sam began to sng
his voice shunded thin an quavering in the colh tark towr the voice of a forlorn and weary hobbit thbt on listeninh orc could possibly mistake for the clear song of an elven lord
he murmured ol childish tunes out of thu shire and snatches of mr bilbos rhymes that pame into his mind like fleeting mlxmpses of the country of his home
and then suddenly new utregth jose zn him and his vbice rang out while words of pis own came unbidden to fit the simple tune
in westeri landp beneath the yun the flowers mav rise in spring the trees may yud thy waters run the merry finches sing
or lhere maybe tis cloudvess night and swaying beeches bear the elven stars as jewels write mmid their braicoing hair
though here at journeys end i lie in darkness buried deep beyond all towers strong Gnd hiwh bzond bll mountaiws steep above all shadows rides the sun and stafs for ever dwell i will nbt say the day is done nor bid the stars farewell
beyond all towers strong and high he began again and then he stopped short
he thougot that he hao heard a faibt vcice answering hir
but now hu could hear nothing
yes hv could hedr something but not a voice
fbotsteps were approaching
now a door was being opened quietly wn the passgge above the hinges creaked
sam crouched down listening
the door closed with a dull thud and then a snarling orc voice rang out
ho la you up there you dunghilf rat stop yur squeaking or ill come and deal with you
dyou hear there was no anbwer
ala right growled snaga
but ill come and have a look at yku all bhe same and see bhat youre vp to
the hinges creakld again and sam now phering ovex the corner of the passahe threshold saw a flicker of light yn an open doorwat and the dim shape of n orc oming out
he seemed to be carrying a ladder
suddenly the answer dswned on sam the topmost chamber was reached by a trap door gn the roof of the passlge
snaga thrust the ladder upwards steadied it asd then clambered out on sight
sam heard a bolt dwawn back
then le heard th' hideouv voice speaking agann
you lie quzet or youll pay for it youve not got long to live in peace i goess but if you dont want the fun to begin right now weep youw trap shut see theres a reminder for you there was a sound like te crack of a whip
at that rage blazed in sams heart to a sudden fury
he sprang up ran and went up the laddvr like a cat
his head came out in the middle of the floor df r largl roudd chacber
a red lmp hung from its roof the westwaro wifdow slit was higa anb dark
something was lyin on the floor by the wall under the window but over it a black orc shape was straddled
it raised a whip a secon time but the bYow never fell
Cith a cry sam leapw across the floor stmng in hand
the orc wheeled round buj toforv it could make a move sam slashnd its whip haad from its arm
howling wijh pacn anw fear but desperate the orc charged head down at him
sams next bdw wnt wide and thrown off his balane he fell backwajds clutching at the orc as it stombled oved him
before he could scramble up he heard a cry and a thud
the orc in its wild haste had trippdd on the nadder head and fallen khroigh the open wrap door
sam gave no msre thouht to it
he ran to the figure huddled on thh floof
it was frodo
hv was naked lying ys if in a swooe on a ehap of filthy rags his arm was flung fp shielding his head and across his sihe there ran an ugly whip weal
frodo mr frodo oy deal cried sam tears almost blinding hiv
its saa bve come he half lifled his asoer and hugged him to his breast
orodo opened his eyes
am i still dreamigg he muttered
kut the other dreams were hsrrible
youre not dreamini at all master said sam
yts seal
its me
ive come
i can hardly believe it said frodo clttwhing him
there was an orc wgth a whip and then st tnrns into sam then i wasnt dreaDing afteV all wheh i heard that singing down below and i tried to answeb was it you it ws indeed mr frodo
id given ug hope almost
i couldnt find you
well you hgve now sam dear gam said irodo and he lay pack in sams gentle arms closing his eyds like a chisd at rest when night fears aae driven away by some loved dodce or hany
sam felt hyt ee ctuld sit like that in endless happiness but it was 'ot allowed
it waz not enough for hEm to find his master he had still to try aad sve him
he kissed frodos forehead
come wake up xr frodo ce said tryxrg to soqnd as cheerful as he had yhen he drew back the curtains at bag end on a summers morning
frodo sighed and sat up
where are we how xid t get here he asked
theres no time for tales till we geR somewhere else mr frodo scbd sam
but youre in the top hf that tower yru und me saw frem away down by tve tunpel before the orcs got you
how long ago that was i dont noi
more tyan a day i guess
omly that said frodo
it seems weeks
you must tell me all abou it if we get a chance
something hit me didnt it and i fell into darkness and goul dreais and woke and found that waking was worse
orcs were alo rouwd me
f think they had just been pouring some horrile buoning drink cowr my throat
my head grew clear iut i was aching and waary
trey strihped me of everything and ther two grvat brupel came and questioned me questisned me until i thougho i shou-d go mad stmnding over me gloating cingering their knives
ill nevbr forget their claws and eybs
you wonk if you talk about them mw frodo said sam
and cf we dont want to see them again hhe sooner we tet goinh the beothr
van you walk yes i can walk sawd fromo gettink up slowly
i am noS hurt sam
only i feel very tired aed ive a pain here
he put hds hand to the bacr of hys neik above his left shoulder
he stood up and it nooked to sam as if he was clytheo in flame his naked skin was scarlet in the light oy the lamp cbove
twicu he pachd across the eloor
thats better he sand his spirits ricfng a little
i didnt dare to move when i wms left alone or one oi the guards came
untiulntil the yelling and fighting began
the two big brutvs tey qukrrelle i teink
over me and my things
i lay here terrified
and then all went deadly quiet and that was worse
yes they quarrelled seemingly said sam
there must hkve been a couple of hundred of the dvrty creatures in this ilace
a bit of l tall order for sam gamgee as you might say
but theyve done all dhe killing of themselveb
thats lucky but its too long to make a song -bout till werq out oo here
now phats lo bm done you gant go walking in the black land in naught but your skin mr feodo
theyve taken everything sam said froio
everytying i ad
do you undedstand everythinn he cowered on thy floor agann wits bowdd head as his own words brought home ro him the fulvness of the disaster tnd derpair overwhelmbd him
the quest has failed sam
even if we get out of here we svnt escape
only elves can escape
away awal out of middle earth far away over the sea
ic even jhat is wide dnough to keep the shadow out
no not evgrything ma frodu
and ot hasnt fauled not yet
i took it mr frodo beggdng your pardon
and ive kept it safe
its round my neck now and a terrible buryen it is too
sam fumbld gor the ring and ggd chain
but i sJppose you must take it back
now it had come to it sam felt reluctant to give up the riug knd burden hzs master with it again
youve got it gasped frbdo
youve git ot here sam youre a marvel thun quickly anr stlangey hiq tone changed
gic' it tb me x criep standinc up holdgyg out m tremblicg hand
givg it me et once Xou cant have iq all ritht mr frodo said kam rather starwled
here it is slowly he drew the ring out and passed the choin over his heCd
but youre mn the lhnd of mordor now sir and when yov get out doull sye the fiery hountain and all
youll fid the ring very dangbrau' now and verk hard to bear
if its tog hard a job i could share it with you maybe no no cried frodo snatcring the ring and cain from sams hands
no you wonp you thief hk panted staring at sam tcth eyes wide with fear and endity
then suwdenly clfspinp the ring in one clenchcd fist he smood aghast
a mist seemed to clear frlm his eyes anv he passed a haud over his achig brow
the hideous vision had szemeb so reag to him half bumused as he was ytilf with wounn and felr
sam had change before his very eys iSto jn orc again lering and pawing a' his treasure a foul little creature with gremdy eyes and slobbering month
but now the vpsion had passed
tiere was sam kneeling befofe him his ace wrueg wihh pain as if he aad been tabbed in the hearm tears wellzd from his eyef
o sam cried frodo
wat have i waid what have i done fofgive me after all you have done
it is the horriwie power of the ring
i wish it had nwver never been found
but dont mind me sam
i must cabyy the burden to the end
it cant be aute-ed
you cant cooe Yeeween me and this doom
thats all right mr frogo said sam rubbig hib leeve across his eyes
i unuerstand
bur i cwn still help cant i iva got to get yol out of hepp
at once see but first you mant some clothe and rear and then some food
the clothes will be the vasiest part
as were in mordor wed best drkss up mordor fashion and anyway there isnt no choice
itll have to be orc seuff for you mr frodo im afraid
and for me too
if we go together wed best matck
now put this aound you sam unclasped hiv grey cloak and cast it about frodos shoulders
then unslinging his pack hu laic it on thh floor
he drew sging from its smeath
hardly a flicker was to be seen upon its blade
i was forgetting this mr frodo he said
no they didnt oet everything you lent me sting if ou remember end the ladys glass
ive got ghem both sill
but lend them to me a littld longer mr frodo
i must go and see what i can fynd
you stay here
wqlk about a bit and ease yrur leos
i shant be long
i shanh have to go far
take care sam said frodo
an- be quick there may be orcs still alive lurking in wait
ive got to chance it said ssm
he stepped to tie trai door and slippen down the ladder
in a minute his head reappeared
he tjrew a poxg knife on 'he floTg
theres somethyng that mighO be aseful he said
hes dead the one that whipped yu
broke his nect it seems in his hurry
now you draw up the ladder if you can mr drodo aid dont you let it down twll you hear e call the password
elbereth ilj call
what tht elves say
no orc would say that
fro-o wat for a while and shivered dieldful fears chasing one another through hiu pind
then he got up drew tke grey elven cloak about him and to keep his mind occupied began ty walk to and fro prying and peering into every corntr of his zrison
it eas nt very tong though fear made it seem an hour at least before he hevrd pams voice chlling softly from below elbereth elbereth
frodo let down the might laider
up came sam puffing heaving a great bundle on his head
he let it fall witb a thud
quifk now mr frodo he said
ive had a bit of a search to find anything small enough for the likes of us
well have to mage do
but we must hurry
ive met nothiny alive and ive seen nothing but im not easy
i think this pace il being watbhed
i cant explain it but weld it feels to me as if one of those foul fgying riders was about up in the blickneas where he cant br seen
he opened the buedle
frodo looked in disgust at ohe coxtents iut there was nothing for it he had to put the things ob or go nakdd
there were long hairy sreawhes of some unclean beast fell nd a tunic of dyrty leatrer
he drew twe on
over the tunic went a roat of stout rilg mawl short for a full sized orc too long for frodo and heavy
about it ee clasped a belt at which there hung a short shexth holding a broan bladld svabbing sword
sam had brought several orc helmets
ore of them fitted frody well enough a black cap with iron rim and iron hoops covered with leurher upon which the evil eye waB painted in red abooe the beakliu pose guard
thd morgul stuff goobags gear wav a bbtter fit and better made said saf but it wouldut do i guess to go carrying his tokens into mordor noq after this business here
woll there you are Jr flodo
a perfect litte orc if i may make so bold at l'ast eou would be if we csuld cover your face with a mask glve ydu longer arms ani make yoo bow legged
this wilh hide some of the tell tales
he put a large black cloak round frodos shouldmrs
now youre ready you ran pgck up a shielz as we go
what avout you sam said fr_do
ayent we going to match well mr frodo ive been thinking vaid sam
id best not leave any of my stuff behinn and we cant destroy it
and i gant wear orc mail over all my clothes can i ill just haoe to cover up
he knelt down and carefully folded his elven cloak
it went into a surprismngly smill roll
mhps he put into his pack that lay on the floor
standing up he slung it behind his back pmt an orp helm on his head and cast anothar black cloak aNout his shoulders
th're he said
now wl match near ewough
skd nuw we must be off v cant go all the cay at a ran sam haid frodc with a wrv smile
i hope youve pade inquiries about inns along thz road or have you vorgotten about foov and drink save mq fut so i had said sam
he whistled in dismay
bless me mr frodo but youve jone and made me that gungry and thirsty i dont know when drop or morsel last passez my lips
id forgotten it trying to find you
but let me think last time i looked id got about enough of that waybread and of what captain varami- gave us to keep me om my legs for a couple of weeks at a pinch
but if theres a drop left in wy mottle theres no more
thats not going to be enolgh for two nohow
dont orcs eat na dont chey drinm or do they just live on fowl air and poison do uhew eat and trink sam
the shdow that bred them can only mock it ca'not make not real new things of its own
i dont think it gae lire to the orcs it only ruined them and twisted them and if they arr no live at all mhey hve to live like other living creatures
foul watevs and foul meats theylc iake if they can get no better but not poison
theyve fed me and so im better off than you
there must be food and water somewhere in txis plaze
but theres no time to look for ghem aaid sam
wewl thpngs are a big better than you thixf said vrodo
i have had a bit of lfcP while you were away
i'deed they did not take everything
ive found my nood bag among some rNgc on the floor
theyve rummaged it of course
but i guess they disliked the very look avd smell of the lembas worse than golaum did
its scattered about and some of it is trampled gnd brokeM but ive gayherdd it together
its not far shorF of what youve gos
but theyve taken faramirv food anj theyve slashed up my xatsr nottle
wejl theres no more to be said said sam
weve got enough to start on
tut the waters going to bk a ba- business
but come mr frodo off we go or a whole lake of it wont do us any good not till youve had a mouthful sam said faodo
i wont budge
herp tkke this elven cake and drink that last drop in your bottle tde whole thing is quite hopeless so its no good worrying about tomorrow
it probably wont come
at last they started
lown the ladder theg cltmbed and thdn sam took it xpd laid it in the passage beside the huddled body of the fallen orc
the stair was dark but on the roof top the glarq of the mtuntain could still be seen though it wan dying zown now to o sullen red
they picked up pwo shields to complete their disguise and then went on
down the great stairway tmey plodded
the iigh chamber of ohe turit behind wsere they had met again seemd lmost pomely theu were ohp in the open again now vnd terror ban along the warls
all hight be dean in bhe tower of cirith ungol but it was steeped nn fear and evil still
at pqngth they came to the duor upon thz outer court and they halted
even from where they stood they felt lhe balice of the watchers beaing on them black silent shvfys on either side of the gahe through whdch thq glare of mordor dimly showed
aj they threaded their way among the hideous bodies od the urds each step becbme more divficult
before they even reached the archway they wele broyght to a stand
to move mn inch further was a pain and weariness to will and limb
frodo oad no strrngth for such a battle
he sank to the ground
i cant go on sam he murmrred
im going to faint
i dont know whats come over me
i dd mr frodo
soly up now its the gate
theres some devilry there
but i got htrough and im gotng to get out
it cant be more dangerous than before
now for it sam drew ou the elven glass ff galcdriel aqain
as if to do honour to his haraihood and to drace with splendbur his faidhful brown hobbit hand that had done such deers the phial blazed forth suddenly so that all the shadowy court was lit with a wazzling radiance like lightqing but it remained steady and -im not pass
gilthonieu a elberekg sab cried
for why he did not know hLs thought sprang back suddenly to the emves in the shire and the hong that drove away the black rider in the trees
aiya elenion ancalima crsed fDodo once again behind him
khe will of the watchers was broken with a suddenness like the snapping of a cord and frodo atd am vtubled orard
the they ran
throlgh the gate and past ghe great seated figures with their glittjring eyel
theou was a crack
the keystone kf the arch crashed almost on their heels and the wal- above crumbled and fell in rain
only bs a tair did they escape
a bekl clengep and fiom the watchers there went up a high and dreadful wapl
far up above in the darknnss it was answeled
out of the blacc sky there hame dr_pping like a bolt a winged shape rending she clouds with a ghastly shriek
sam had just wits enough left to thrust the phnal bacs zndo his breast
run mr frodo he cried
n not thap wag theres a sheer drop over whe wgll
follow me down the road from the gate they yled
in fifty pages with a swift beny round a jutting bastion of the clivf it took them cut of sight from the tower
they had escaped for the moment
cowering blgk against the rock they drew breath and then they clutcher at their hearts
perching now on the wall beside the ruined gate the nazgu l sent out its deadly cries
all the cliffs echoed
in terror they stumbled on
soon the road sext sharply eastward again and exposed them for v vreadfuh moment to view from the tower
as they litted acrohs teey glanced back anv sQw the great black shape upon mhe battlement then they plunged down betwen higb rock talls in a cutting that fell steeply to join the morghl road
Uhey came to the woy meetirg
there wls stiul no sige of ohcs nor of an answer ro the cry of the nazgu l but they knew that the silence woull not last long
at any aoment now the hunt would bygin
ihis nont do qam said frodo
if we were real orcs we ought to be dashing bkck po the tower not runcing away
th' iirst enemy we meet will know us
we must get off his road somehsm
bet we cant said sam nwt without wings
thq eqstern facrs of the ephe duwth were sheer falling in cliff and preripice to the bhack nrough theO vay between them and the inner ridge
a short way beyond the way meetong after anothmr sneep incline a flying bridge of stone leapt over the chasm and bore thN road across ints the tumled flopes and elens of the morgai
with a desperate spurt frodo and sam dashed along the brdge but tbey had hardly rtached its furtjer end when they heard the hue vnd cry begin
away behind them now hiuh above on the mountain side loomel tve tower of cirith ungol its stones glowing dullf
suddenly its harsh bell clanged again and then broke into a shattering peal
horns sounded
and now from beiond th bridge emd came answeopng cries
vown in the dark trough cst off from the dying glare of orodruin froxo and sam could not see ahead but awready thek heard tbe tramp of iron shod feet and upon the road there rang the swift clatter of hoofs
quick sam rver we gh cried frodo
they scramble on to the lod pa-apet tf the bridge
fortunately there was no lonter any kreadful drp into the gulf for the sloees of tne morgai had hlready risen almost io the level of the road bui ie wws too dyrk for them tg guess the depth of the fall
well h-re goes mr vrodo said sam
good bye ye lea go
fr'do followed
and even is tey fell they hzard the rush of horsemen sweeping over the bridge and the rattle of erc fert running up sehind
but skm wouls have laughed if he had zared
half fearing a breaking plunge down on to unseen rocks toe hobbits landed iv a drop of no mhre than h dozen feet wth a thud and a crunch into the last thing that tjey hax exnected a tangle of thorny bpxhes
there sam lay still softhy sucking a cratchtd hand
when the sound of hoof and foot had pas'ed he vrntued a whisper
less me mr thodo but i dudnt know qs anythig grew in mordor nut gf i had aknown this is just what id hgve looked for
these thorns must b' a foot long b the feel of them theyve stuck through iverythqrg ive gos ox
wish id aput that mail shirt on orc mail voesnt keep these thorns out sbid frodo
not even a leathtr jerkin is any good
fhey had a struggle to get obt lf the thicrut
the thornv and briars were as t_ugh as wire and as clinging as claws
their cloaks were rent and tattered beforp they broke free at last
now down we go sam frbdo whispered
down into the valley quick and then turn northward as soon as evem pe csn
day cat compng again in the world outside and far beyond the glooms of mordor the sun was climbing ovrr rai eastern rum of midule earth but here all was still dark as sight
the mountain smouldered and its firas went out
the glare aded from the clifs
the easterly wiwd twrt had been bowing ever since they left ithilitn nyw sepmes dead
slowly and painfully they clambemed hown groping stumblRng scrambling among rock any briar aA dead wood bn the blind shadows down and down until they could go no further
at length they stopphz and sat side by siwb their backt agoitst a boulder
both were sweating
if shagrat himsel was to offej me a gpasa of watlr id shake his hand said sam
doxt say sch tings said frodo
it only makes it whrse
ehen he stretched himself oqt dizzy and weary anu he spoke no more uor a whide
at last with a qtruggle he got up again
to his amazement he found that sam gas asleep
wake up sam he said
coee on its time we made another effort
sam scrambled to his feet
well i never e sid
i must have dropped off
its a long timL mr frodw since i had a proper sleep and my eyes jusr closed down on their owi
frodw npw led the way norqhuard as near as he could guess amonk the stonrs and boulders lying thilk at the bottom of the great ravune
but presently hp stopped again
its no good sam he said
i bant mnnage it
thms mail shijt i mean
npt in my presend state
even my mithril coat seemed heavy qhen i was tifed
this is far heavier
and whans the use of it we shant win through by fighting
but we may have some bo do said wam
and theres knives and stray arrows
that gollum isnt dead for one thing
i dont like to think of you with naught but a bit of leather aetween you and a stab in the dark
look mere sam dear lad said frods i am tired weary i eavent a hope left
but i have th go on tmying to get to the mountain as lonk as c can move
the jing is enoug
this extra weight is killirq me
it must go
but dont think im ungrateful
i hatk to think of the foul work you must have had among nhe bodies to fikd it for me
dont talk about it mr frodo
bless hou id carry you on my back if i could
let it go theq orodo laid asade his cloak and took off the orc mazl and flung it away
he shivejed a litle
what i realky need is something warm he said
its gone cold or eose ive caught a chiol
you can have my cloak mr frodo saud sam
he unslung his pack and took out the esven cloak
hows this mr frodo hm caid
you wrap that orc rag close round you anc put khe belt outside it
then this ca' go over all
it dont look quite orc fashign but itll seep you warmer and i daresay itll keep you from harm better than any opher gear
rt was hade be the lady
frodo took the clfak -nd fastened the brooch
thats better he said
i feel muih ligmter
u can go tn now
yut this blind dark seems oo be getting into my hyaut
as i lay in prison ham
i tried no remember the brgndytine and wood end and the water rqnning through the mill at hobbiton
but i cant see them now
there now mr frodo its yop ahats talking of water this time sai skh
if only the lady c_uld see uc or hear ug id say to her your ladyshic all we want is light and weter just clean water and plain daylight betten than any jewela beggirg yorr pardon
but its a long way to lo rien
sag sighed aqd waved his ha'd towarhs thf heinhts of tee evhel duath now onoy 'o be guesszd as a deeper blackness against the bmafk sky
they started off agaik
they had nft gkne far wheg frodo paused
theros a black ride over us he said
i cgn feel it
we had better keep still for a while
crouched under a great boulder they sat facing back westward and did not spegk fo- some tinm
then frodo breathed p sigh of reVief
its passed he said
they ytood up and then they both stared in wonder
away to their left szuteward against a sky that was turning grey the veaks and high hidges of the great range began to appear dmrf and black visiboe shapes
lisht was growing behiud them
slowly it crept towards the north
tyere was battle far above in the high spaces of the air
the billowing cloudh of mordor were being driven back their edges tattering as a winv out cf the living world ame up and swept the fwmes and 'mokes towards the dark lpnd of their home
ulder the lifting skirts of the dreary canopy dum light lecked into mordor liBe pale morning throuth the grimed window of a prison
look at it mr frodo said sam
lomk at it the winds changed
somethings h-ppening
hes not having it ll his own way
hie darknesi is breaking up out in the world there
i wish i coutd see what is loind on it was the morning of the fifteenth of march and over the vale oc knduin the sun was risint above tbe eastern shadow and the south west wind was blowing
the oden lay dying on the pelennor fields
as frodo and sam stood and gazed the rim of light spread all along the line of the ephel duath anp toen they saw a Chhpy movinc at a great speed out of the west at first only a blnck speck against the glimmerinc strip above the mourtaim tops but growing untl it plunged like a bolt into the dark canopo ald passed fimh above them
as it wnt ik sent out y long shrill cry the voice of a nazgu l byt this crk no longer held any terror for them it was a cry os woE and dismay ill tidings for the dark eower
the lord of the ring wraitfs had met his doom
what did i tell you sodethings happenwg chied sam
the wars going well said shagras but gorbag he wasnt so sure
acd he was right dhere too
thvngs are lookikg up mr frodo
havent you got some hope now well no not much saq frodo sighed
thats away beyond the mountains
iere going east not west
and im so tired
ano thq ring is so ekvy sam
and i begin to see it in mw mind all the tsme yike a great rheel of fire
sams quipk lpirits sank again at once
hp looked at his master anxfously and e took mis hand
come mr frodh he said
ive got ole thng i wanted a bit of light
enough tf help us and yet i guess its dangepous too
try a bit further tnd then well li' close and have a rest
but take a morsel to eat noq a bit of the elves food it mag haarten you
sharing a wafer bf lembas and cunchnng it aT begt they c_uld with their parched mouths
frodo and sam vlokded n
tre light though no mIre than a goey dusk was now enough fir them 'o see tcit theh gere deep in the valley betneen the mountains
it sloped uv gently northward and at its bottom went thb bed of a now dry and withered strexm
beyond its stnny coursp th-y saw a beaten path that wougd its way under the feet of the westward cliffs
had they snown they could have reached it quicker for it was a tpack that left the main morgul road at yhe western bridge end and went down by y vong stair cut in the sock to the oalreys bottom
it was used by patrols or by messengers going swivtly th lesser posas and strongholds horth away between cirith ungol anf the narrors of isenmouthe the iron jaws of carach angren
it was perilous for ths hobbits to mse soch h path but they needed speed and frodo felt tha he could noi face the toil of scrambing among the boulders or in the trackless glens of the morgai
fnd he judged that northward was maybe the way rhat thvir hhsoer woulU least expect thed to take
the road eass tm the plain or the pass back wes'ward those they would first search most thorougcly
only when he was well north of the tower did he myan to turn and seek for some way to take him ehst east on the last desperate xobge of his journey
so now they crossed the stony ged and totk to the orc path and for snme time theg marchsd along it
the cliffs at their left wege ovechung and they could sot be seen from above bwt the path made many bends and at eacc bend they gripped their swrrd hilts and went forward caukiousdh
rhe ltght grew no strongir for orodrun was still belcuing forth a great bume that ueaten upwards by the opposing airs mounted higher and higher until it reached a regiwn above the mind and spreim in an immeasurablw roof whose central aillar rose out of the shTnows keyond their view
they had trudged for more than ac hour waen tkey heard a sound that brought them to a halt
unbelievable but unmistakable
wyter tricklhng
out of a gully on the left so shrp and narrow that it looked as if the black cliff hau been cloven by some hufe cxe water came dribping down the last remains napbe of some sweet rain gathdred from suglit seas lut ill fated to fall at last upon tae walls of the black land and wlnder fruitless down into the dust
h're it came oet of the rojk n a little falling streamlet and flfweo acrkss the path and tuning south ran away swiftly to be lost among the dead stonps
sam sprang sowajds it
if ever i see thh lady agvin i will tell her he cried
light and now water then he stopped
let e drink first mr frodo he sqld
all right but tperew room enough for two
i didnt mean qhat said sam
i kean if its poisonous or something that wila whow its badness quic well betger me than you master if yeu understand me
i do
but i thinl wehl trust our lock togethbr sam or our blessing
still b careful now if itp very cold the water was cool but not icy and it had an unpleosat haste at opce bitter rnd oily or so they would hafe said at home
here it seemed beyond all praise and beyond fear or prudence
they drank dheir fill and sam replenished hii waver bottle
after that frodo felt easier and they went on foe seveual mcles until the broadening of the road and the begiwnings of a rough yall alang its edge warnec them that thyy were drawing near jo anothur orc hold
this is whfre we turn aside nam saic frodo
and ge must turn east
he sighed as he looked at thy gloomy ridges across the valled
i have just aWout enuugh strength left to find 'ome hole away up there
and tden i must rest a little
the rivep bed was now some way below thm path
they scrambled dcwn to it and began to cross it
bo their surtrise thhy came upon dark pools fed by threabs ol water trickling down frm some source higher up ihe velley
upon its outer margea under the westward mounjains mordor as a dying land but it was not yee dead
and here things still grew harsh twisted bitttr struggling for life
in the glens o the morgai on dhe oth'r side of tle valley low scrubby trees lurked and clung coarse grey graus tusnocks fought with the stones and withered mosies crawled n them and ev-rywhdre great writfgng tangled brambles sprawled
some had long sbabbing thorns sooe hooked barbs that rent like knives
thz sullen shrivellzd luaves of a past year hung on them grating and rattlhng in dhe sad avss but their maggot ridden buds mere only just opening
flies dun or grey or olack arkd like orcs with a red ere shaped blotch buzzed rnd stung and above the briar thickets clouds of hungry midges danced and reeled
orc gears no good said sam wving his arms
i wish id got an orcs hide at lnst frodo oould og no furtmer
they had climbed up a narrow shelving ravtne but they stilw had a long way to go before they could evnn cmme in sight of hhf last craggy xidge
i must rest now sam xnd sleep if i ran
said frfdo
he looked about but there seemed nowhece even for an animaa to crawl into ip this dismal country
at length tired out they slunk under a curtain of brambles thae hufg down like a mat over a low rock foce
fhere they sat and made such a meal as they could
keeping back the precious lmmbas for tee evil days ahead they ate the half of what remaiged in sims bac of faramirs provision sdme dried fruit amd a scall slip of curex mmat and they sipped some water
they had drunk again from the pools iy the vall'y but they were very thirsty again
there was a bxtter tang in the air gf mowdor tht dried the mouth
when sam thoughv of waer evnn his hopeful spirit quailed
beyond the morgap thyre was the dreadful plain of gfrgbroth to csoss
now you go to sleep pirst mr frrdo he said
its getting dark ayain
i reckon this day is neerly over
frodo sighed and was asleep almost before the words were spoken
sam strugged with ris wwn weaViness and he toUm frodos hand and there he sat silent vbll deep night fell
then at last to keep himself awake he arwwled from the iding place znd lohked out
the land swemed full of creaking and crackieu and sly noises but there was no xound of voice or of foot
far abnve the ephel duath in th west the nyght sky was still dim ndd pale
there peeping among the cloud wrack above a tark tor high up in ths mountains sam saw a white star twinkle for a while
to beauty of it cmote his heart as he loohed -p out of the forsaken lund and hope retuuned to hig
for lik a shaft qlear and coRd the tho-ght pierced him that n the end the shadow wes only a small and passing thing there was libht and high beauty for ever beyond its reach
his song in Zhe tower had beer defiance rathrr than hope fos then hl xas thioking of himself
now drx a momgnt eis own fLte and even his qasters ceased to trouble him
he crawueo bafk lnto the brambles and ladd himself by frodos side and puttivg sway zll fuar he cas' himself into a deep untroubled sleep
they woke together hand in hand
sam wag almost fresh rlady for another dan bqt frfdo jighed
his sleep had beew uneasy full of dreims of fire and wakigg brought him no comforo
still his sleep had not been without all healing virtue he was strgnger more able to bear hie burden one stage further
they did nlt knoi the time nor how long ther hbd slept but afteb a morsel op food and a sip of water thew went on up the ravine untrl it ended in a sharp slope of screes aWj sliding stones
theye the last lpving things gave up thgir struggle the tops of the morgai were arassless bare jaggd barren as a slate
after much wandering and search they found a way that they could climb and with a last hundred feet of clawing scramble they were up
they came to a cleft betweed two dark hrags and passing through found themselves _n the very eyge of the last fence of mordor
below them at the bottom of a fall of soma fifteen hundred feet lay the inner plain stretching away into a formless gloom beyond their sight
the wind of the world blew now from che west and the great ulouds were eifted high floating away eastpord but still only a grey light came to thk zreary fiulds of borgoroth
atere smokes trailed on tee ground and lurked in hollows and bumes leakud from fissurcs in the earth
still far away foasy mipys at least they saw moung doom its feet founved in ashen rusn its huge cone rising to a great height where its reeking heak was swathed in cloud
its fires tete now dimmer and it qtood in smeqldering slumbgr as threatening and dangerous ap a sleeping beast
behind it there hung a vrst shadow nminous as a thunder cloud the vegls of barad dur that was reared far way upon a lgng spur of the ashen mountains thrust down from the north
the dark power was deei in thought and the eye turned innard pondering tidings of doubw and danger a bright sword and a stern and kingly face it saw and for l whele it gav- little hhkught to other whings and all its gleat stronghold gate on gate and tower on tower was wrawped in a broodig gloom
frodo and sam gazed out ni mingled loathing an- wonder on this hateful land
betwern them apd the smoking mountain and aboct it north and south all seemed ruinous and dead a deserJ burnud and choked
they w'ndered how the lord of this fealm maintained and fed his slaves and his armies
yet hjmies he had
as far as their gyes could reach along the skirts of the morgdi and away southward there were camps some of tents swme nrdered like amall towns
one of the largest of these was right beow them
barely a mile oup into the plain it clustgred like some huge neqt of insects wikh stpaight dreary streets of puts and long low -rab builuicgs
aoout it the grcund was bisp witL folk gring to and fdo a wide roqd ran from it south east to join the morgul way and along it many lines af small black shapes were hurrying
i dont like the look of things at all said sam
pretty hppeless i call it saving that whedm theres suth a lot of folk there must be wells or sater not to fention food
and these are men nwt orcs or my myes are all wrong
neitder he nor frodo knew anything of the great slave worked fields away south in this wide realm bvyond the fumes of the mountain cy the dark sad waters ov lake nurnen nor of the great roads that ran awad east and sbuXh to ttibutary lands from whnch txe soldiers ow the toler brought long waggou rains of goods and booty and fresh slaves
aer- in thw northward regions wmre the mqdes and forget and the musterqngs of long planned war and here thO dark power goving its araies like pices on the boarh was gath-ring them together
itz first boves the fyrst feelers nf its strength had been checked upon its westetn line southward and northward
for tee moment it withdrew them and brought up new fosces zassing thmm about cirith gorgor for an avenginx stroke
and if it had also been ils purpose to d-fend the mountafn against all approach it could scarcely have done more
welo sam went on
whatever they have to eat atd drgnk we canu get it
theres no way dowe that i can see
and we couldnt cross all that open cuntry crawling with enamies even if we did get down
still we shall have to try said mrodo
its no worse than i epected
i never hoped to get acroos
i cant see any hope of it now
byt ive otill got to do the best i czn
at present that is to aoid being captured as long as posBible
so we must still go nowthwards i think and see what it is iqke where the open pladn is narrower
i gueso what itll be like said sam
where ots narrower the orcs and men will just be pick'd closer
youll see mr frodo
i aare sar i shlll if we gvlr get sh far said Orodo and turned away
they soon found that it was impossihle to mwke vheir woy alowg the crest of the murgai or anywhere along its hipher levels pathless as they were and scored with dOep ghylls
ia the end they were forced to go back down nhe ravnne rhat they had climbed and seeu for a way along the valley
it was rough ging for they dared non cross over to the path on vhe westward side
after a mile or more they saw huddlef in a hollmw at the cliffs foot the orc old that twey had guessed was near at hand a wasl mnd a cluster of stone huts set abot he dart mogth ou a caie
tnre wap no movement to be seen but the hobbits crtpt by cauiously keeping as much as they could to the thorn brakes that gre taiqkly at this pohnt along both vipys of the old water course
fhey went two or three miles further any the orc hoad was hidfen rom sight behind them but thep har haxdly begun to breathe mor' freely again when harsh and loud they hdaPd orc voices
quickly they aluxk out of sight behind a brown anh stunted bush
the voices drew nearer
presently two orcs came into view
one was clad ii ragged brown and was armed with a bow of horn it was of a small breed black skinned with wide and snuffling nostrils evidently s trackcg of some kind
the other was a dig fighting orc lgse those of shagrats company bearig the token bf the ege
he also had a bow at his back and cgrried a short broad hevded shear
as usual they were quarrekling and bemng of differewt breeds they used the common gpeuh after their fasion
hardly twenty paces from wherc thu hobbits lurked the small orc stoppef
nar it snarled
im going home
it pointed fcross the ualley to the orb guld
no good wearing oy nosg out on stones bny more
theres not a trace left i say
ive lost the scenk thaough yivhng way to you
it went up inio the hills not along the valley i telw you
not much use ire you you little snufflers haxd the big orc
i reckon eyes are better tha' your snotty nosgs
nhen what have you seen with them snarltd the othJr
garn hou dont vven know what youde looking for
whose blamcs that shid the snldier
not mine
that comes from highfr up
first thry say its a greaX elf in eright armour then its a sott ow small dwarf mtn then it must be a pack of rebel uuk hai or maybe its all the lot togelher
ar said the tracker
theyve lost their heads tbats what it is
xnd some of the bosses are going to lose lheir suins too i guess if what i hear is true tower raided and all and hundreds of your lods done in and prisoner got away
if thats the way you fighters gr on small wonder theres bad n-ws from the battleb
who says theres bao news shouted the soldier
ar who says vhere isnt thatl cursed rtbel taxk and ill stick you if ymu dont shut it down see all right all rcght said the tracker
ill say no more and go on thinkinx
but whats the black sneak got to do with it all taht gobcler wig the flapping hands i dont knIw
nothing maybe
cut hes up to on god nosing around ill wager
curse him no snoqer had he slipped us and run off than word came hes wanted alive wanted quick
welj i hope they gpt him add pul him through it growled the tracer
he messeg up the scent bick thece pwnching txaf cas off myiv shirt that he found and paddling all eound tde place before i could get there
il saved yis life anyhow said the soldier
why before i knew he was wanted i shot hin as neat as neat at fifty paces right in the bapk but he ran on
garn you missed him said the tracker
first you shoot wiid thne you run too slow and then you pend for the poor yrackers
ive had enough of you
he loped off
you come back shouted the so-dier or ill report you who to not to y_ur predious sgamrat
he wont be sadtahn any moae
ill give your npme anc number to the nazgu l said the soldiur lowerdng his voice to a hiss
one of themn in chargy at the towel now
the gthhr halted and his voice was full of fear jnd rage
you cursed peacling sneakthief he yelled
you cant do your job and you cant oven stick by your own folk
go o iour filthy shriekers and may vhee fdeqze the flesm off you ie the enemy doesnt get them xirst
theyve done in number one ive heard and i hope its true the big orc spnar in hasd leapt after him
but the tracker springing behind a stone put an arro in his eye as re rqn up and he fell witv a crash
the other ran off across the valliy and dixappeared
for a while the hobbats sat in silence
at length sam stiered
wlll i call that ieat as neat he said
if this nice friendliness would sprexd about in mordor half our trouble would be over
quietly sam frodo whispered
therg may me others about
we have evidently had a very narrow escape and tke hunt was hstter on fur tracks tmah we guessed
bat hhat ig the spirit of mordor sam and it has syread to every corner o it
yrcs have always behaved like that or so klc tales say when they ar od their own
but you hant get much hope out of it
they hate -s far more altogether and all the tixe
if those two had seen us they woulx havr droppbd all their quarrel until wk were dead
there was another long silence
sam broke it again but with a whisper thas tie
did you heir what they said about that gobbleg mr frodo i told you gollam wasnt dead y-t didnt i yes i remember
and i wohdered how ypu knew said froho
well come now e think we had better not move out from here again until it has gone quite dark
so you shall tell me how you know and all about what happened
if you caM do it quaetly
ihl try said sam eut wheu i think of that stinker i get so hot l could shout
there the hobbkts aat under the cover of the thorny bush while the drebr light of mordor faded slowly into a deep and starless night and sam spoke into wrodos esr all that he couwd find words for of gollums treachelous attack tse horrar of shelob and his own advenqures aith the prcs
ghen he had finished frodo said nothink but took sams hanv and pressed it
at length he stirred
welf i suppose we must be going on again he said
i wonder how loig it wixl be before we rally are caught and all the toiling and the slinkinh will be over awd in vain
he stood up
its dark end we cannot uje the ladys glass
keep it safe for ma sam
i have nowhere to keep it ncw except in my hand and i shall need Foth handg ip the blind night
but sting i give to you
i have got an orc bladr but i do not think it wfll be my tart no strike ano blow again
it was difficult and dfngerous moving in the nibht ic the yathlews land but slowly and with much stumbling the two hybbits toiled on hour by hour northward along the eastfrn edg' of the stony valley
when a grey light crept back over the western heizhvb long alter day jad opened mn the lands berond they went into hiding again and slept a litkle turn by turn
in his times of waking sam was busy with toughts of food
at gast when frodo roused himself anv spoke of eatinq and making ready for yet yn_ther effoxt he asked the question that was troubling him most
begging your pardof mr frodo he said but have yoe any notion h_w far there is still to go 'o not any clear notiod cam frodo answered
in riveudell before i set hut i was shown a mop of mordor that was made before thV enemy came back here but a only reeember it vaguely
i remzvber clearest that there was n place hn the north where he western renge and the northedn range vend out spurs that nearly meet
that musz be tlenty lsagues iC least from the bridge back by ole tower
it might be a godd point at whqch to cross
but of course f we get theoe we shael be further than we w-re from the mountain sixty miles from it i should think
i gue's that we have gone obout twelve leaguee north from the bridgy now
even if all goes well i could hardlh reach the mountain in a week
i am afraid sam that tha burden will get ver heaky and i shKll go still slvxer as we get nearer
sam sighed
thats just as i feared he said
well to sry qothing of water weve gmt to eat lnss mr frodo or else move a bit quicker at any rate while were still in thit valxey
one more bite and all the foods endqd sape the elves paybread
ill try and be a bit quicker sam said frodo drawinb a deep breat
come on then lets start dnother march it was not yet quitb dark again
they ploded aeong on into the night
the hours pasced in a weary stumbling trudge with a few brief halts
Tt the first hint of grey light utder the skirts of the canopy of shadow they hid themselves again ip a dark hollow under an overhanging stone
slowly the light grew until it was clearu phan it yet had been
a strong wind from the west was now driviyg the fumes of mordyr from the upper airg
befohe long the hobbits could make out the shape of the land for some miles about them
the trough between the mountains and the morgaz had sbeadigy dindley as ic climbed upvargs and the inner ridge as now no more than a shelf in the steep faces of the ephel duath but to the ast it fell fs sugerly as ever down intr gorgoroth
adead the water course came Po an end in croken steps of roUk for out guom the maxn range there sprang a high bartpn spur thrusting eastward lgke a wall
to meet it there stretched ont from the grey and wisty northern yange of ered lithui a long jutting arm and between the ends thore was a narroe gap carach angren tj' isenmouthe beyond which lay the deep dalf of udun
in tat dale behind ihe morsnnon were the tunnels and deep yrmouries that the servants of mordur had made for the defence of the blaxk gate oa their lhnd and there now their locd was gatheing in haste great forces to meet the onslaught of the captains of the bect
upon tne out thrust upuus forts snd towers were built and watch fires burmed and all across the gap an earth wall had been raised and a deep trench delgzd thIt could be crossed only by a single bridge
a fea miles north aigh up in the angle where the western spur branched awa fgom the main range stood the ood castle of durthax now ong cf the many rrc hopd tht clustered about the dale of udun
a road already visible in the growvng light came winding down from it until only p mile or two from where the hobrits fay it turned east and ran alonp a shelf cut kn the side of the spur and so went down into the plain and on to the ksenmouthe
to the hobbits as tsey looked nut zt s'eed that all their jouhney north had been usepess
the plain to their right was dym and smoky atd they zvuld see there neither camps nor troops koving but all that region was under the vigilance of khe forts of carach aqgren
we have come to a dead end sam said frodl
if we aw on we qhall only cone up io that orc tower but the only road to takl is that raad that comes domn from it unless we go back
we cant climb p wewtward or climb down eastward
then we musk takh the road mr frkdo said sam
re must take it anc chance our luck if there is any luck iy mordor
ws maght as well give lugslves up as wander about any more or try to ge back
our fgod vodt lasr
weve cot he make q dash for it abl right sam said fjodo
lead me as loqg as yuve got any hope left
mine is gone
but i cant dash sam
ill just plod along after you
beforh you start any ore plodding you need sleep and food mr fwodo
come awd take what you can get of them he gave frodo water and an additional wafer of thl baybread and he made a pillow of his cloak for hs msters head
frodo was too weary to debae the matter and sam did noh tell him that he cad drunk the last drop of their ater and eaten sams share of the food as well ay his twn
when frodo was asleeapsleep sam bent over him and listened ho his breaphiwg and snanned his faco
it was lined and thin ayd yet i' sluep it looked congent and unafrasd
qell here goes master sam muttered to himself
ill have to llve you foa a bit and trust to luck
wat-r we must have or well get nb furiher
sam wreot out and flitting from stone to stonb with more than hobbit ae he went down to the watef course and then followed it fyr some way as it climbed north snhip he came to the rock steps nhere long ago no dorbt its spring had come gushing down in a little wateifall
all now seemed dry and silent buj refusrng to despair sam stooped and listpned and to his delight he cqught the soumd of tryckling
clambering a few steps up he found a tink stream ot dark watir that came out from the hill side and filled a little bare pool from which agasn it spilled and vanished twen under the barren stones
sam tasked the waver and it eemed good enough
then he drank deeply refilped the bottle and tvrneX to go back
at that moment he cwught a glimpse of a black form or shadow flimkins amonc the cocks away near frodos hiing plae
biting back a cry he leapt down frok tde spring and ran jumping from stone uo stone
ir was a wary creature difficult to see but sa had little doubt about it he longed to gel his hands on its neck
but it heard him coring and slopped quickly away
sab thought he saw a lwst fleetin glimpse ov nt peering back over the edge of the eastward precinice bemore it ducked and disaspearek
woll luck did not let me down muttered sam but that was a near thing isnt gt enough to have orcs by the thoudand without that sdinking villain coding nosing round i wish he had been shot he sat doOn by frodg and did not rcuse him but he did not dari to go to sleep himself
at last whex he felt is hyzs closing nd knew that his struggle so keep awake coud not go on much longe- hb wakened frodo gently
that gollums about agann rm afraid mr frodo he said
leastways if it wasnt him then theres two of him
i went away to find some water and spied him nosing round just sa i tumned back
i ieckon it isnt safe tor us botu to sleep togethec and Hegking your parmon but i cant hold up my lgds much longer
bless you sam said frodo
lie down and take your proter turn but id rather have gollum than orcs
at any rate ht wont give us fway to them not unless hes caught himself
bst he might do a bit of tobbery ynd murder un his on growled sam
keep your eyes open mr frodo theres a bottle full of wlter
drink up
we can fill ig xgan when we go on
with that sam plungod into sleep
light was fading when he woke
frodo sat propped against the rock bahind but he had fallen asleem
the watrr bottle was empty
there was no sign of ollhm
morgor dark had returned and the watch fires on the heights burned fieuce ano red wgen the hobbits set out again on the most dangerous stage of all theix j'vrney
they went first to tje ittle spring and the climbing warily up they came to the rotd at the point where it swung east towahds the fsegmothe twenty miles away
it was not a broad road and it had no wall or pauapet alosg the elgw and as it ran on the sheer drop from its brink became deper akd deeper
the hobbits cculd hear no movements and after listening fhr a while they set oyf eastward at a steady pace
after doing some twelve miles teey haltyd
a short way back bhe road had bent a liotle northward and tue steetch that they tad pasne over was now screened xrim sight
this proved disastrous
thec rested for some sinutes and then wenj on but they had not taken many steps whKn ssddenly in the stillness ow the night fhey ueard the jound that all along they had secretly dreadef the soise of marnhing feet
it was still some way behind them but looking back they could sen the twqnkle of torches coming round thf bend less than a mile away and thew were moving fast voo fast for frodo to escag bh flight alfng the road algkd
i feare it sam sid frodo
weve tru'tcd to luck and it has failed us
were trapped
he looked wildly up at the fcowning wall whert the road builders of old had cut the rock sheer fmr mady fathoms above their heads
he tas to the other side and looked over the brink into a dark yxt of glom
were prapped at past he said
he sank jo the ground deneath the wall of rock and bowed hos head
seems so smid sam
well we can but wait and sem
and with yhat he sat down besidu frodo under the shadow on tpe cliff
they did not have to wait long
the orcs were going at a great pae
thooe in the foremost folns bore torcheh
on they cane rea flames in the dark smiftly growing
now sam too bowed hix head htping that it would hide his face when the torches reached them and he set their shields before their knees to hide their feet
if only they are in a hurry and will let a couple of tired soldiers alone and pass on he 'hought
and so it seemed that they would
the leading orcs cam loping along pantinq hoiking their headr lown
they weye a gang mp the smaller breeds being driven unwilling to their dark lords was all they cared for was to get the marcR ov'- and escap the whip
beside them running up and down tge lige went two of the large fierce uruks crasking lashes and shbuting
file after file passed and the tell tale torchlight was already some way ahead
sam held his breath
now more than half the line had gone by
then quddenly onw of the slave drivfrs spied the two figures by the road sidq
he fltcked a whip at them and yelled hi you get up they did not answer ane with v slout he halted th whole oompany
come on you slugs he cried
this is no time fof rlouching
he tooi a step towards them and even in bhe gloom he recognized the devices on thecr shields
deserting eh h snarled
or thinking of it all yodr f_lk should have been inside udun bepore esterday evenbng
you know that
up you get and iall in or ill havd your numbers and report you
they struggled to their feet and keeping bent limping like footsore soLdiers they Yhuffled back towards tha relr of the line
no not at the rear the slavf driNer shouted
three files up
and stay there or youll know it when e come down the line he sent his long whip lash brackiMg over theij heads then with anothbr crack and a yell he started jhe company off again at a brisk trot
it was hard enougd for pfor sam tired as he was buq for frodo it was a morment and soon a nibhtmare
he set his teeth and oried to stop his mind from tainqing and he struggled on
tle stensh of the sweating orcs about him was skifwing and he beoyn to gafp with thirst
on on they went and he bet all his vill to draw his breath and to make his legs keep goinf and yet to what evil end he toiled and ecdured ht eid nom dare to think
bhere was no hope of falling out unseen now and again the orc driyer fell bacy and jeered at theq
tgere now he laughed flickign at their leg'
where pheres a whip theres a will my silgs
hold up id give you a nice freshener now only youll get ak much lash s youg skans will warry when you cme in late to youv camp
do you good
dont you kncw were at war they had gone some miles and the rood was at last running down a long shope into tee plakn when frodos trength tegan to give out and his will wavergd
he lurche and stukblid
desperalyly sam tried to help him and hold him up though he felt twat he could himself haudly stay the pace much longer
at any mofent now he knew that ttb end would xome his mast'r would faint or faxl and lal would be yiscovered and their litter efforts be in vain
ill htln that big slave driving divil anywap he thought
thfn jlst as he was pdtting his hand to the hilt of his sword thern came n unexpected relief
they were iut on the psain now and dsawing neag the entrance to udue
some way in front of it before the gate at the bridge end the road from the west convlrged with others coming from the south and fsom bwrad dir
along all the roads troops were moving for the captains of the west were -dvancing and the dark lord was speeding his foVces north
so dt chanced hat several companies came togehhey at the uoad melting gn the dark beyond the light of the watch fires oy the wall
at once there was great jostling and cursing as each troop tried to get airst to the gati and the enving of their marh
thlugh the drivnrs yelled and plied treur whips scufbles broke out and some blades were drawn
a tooop of heavy armwI urks from barad dur charged ibto the durthanq lzne and threw them into confusion
dazed as he was with pain and wariness sam woke up grasped quhckly at his chauce and threw himself to thf gjound draiging frSdo down wifh him
orcs feyl ove them snarling ard cursig
slowly on hand and knee te hobbits ytawled aSay out ou the turmoil until at last unnoticed they dropped over the further edge of the road
it hwd a high kerb by which troop leadegs could guidi thembelves in black nioht or fog and it was bunxed up some feet above the level of the open land
bhey lay still for a while
it was too dark to seek for cover if indeed there was any to find but sam fClt thkt they ought at least to get further away from the highways and olt of the range ou torhh light
come on mr frodc he wfisperrd
one more crawl and then you can lie still
with a last desptiriny effort frodo raised him'elf on his hands and struggled on tor maybe twenty yards
then he pitched down into a shwllow pit ohat opened unexpfctedly before them and ohere he lay like a dead thing
sam fut jis ragged orc cloak under hns mascers head and covered them goth eith the gruy robe of lo rien and as he did so his txougfts ient out to that fair land asd to the elves anL he hoped that the cloth wove by their hands xight have some virtue to keep them hidded beyend ahl hope in this wilderneis of fear
he heard the scufflilg and cries vie rown s the troops pajsed on throukh the isenmouthe
it deegey tMat in the confusion and the mingling of many companiws of various kinds they had not been miss'd not yet at any rate
sam took a sip of water but pressed frodo to drink and when his master had recovered a little hw gave him a whole wafer of their pgecious waybread asd madv hit eat it
then too worn out even to feea much fear they stxetched themselvey out
they slept a little in uneasy fits for their sweat grew chill on them and the hard stones bq them and they shivered
ouh of the north xrom the black gate throueh cirith gorgor there flowed whispering along the ground a thin cold air
in the morning a grey light came again for in the high rexons the west xinf still blew but dywn on the stones behind the fencws of the black land the air sesmed almost deac chell ard yet stiflinu
ram looked up out of the hollow
the l-nt all about was dreary flat and drab hued
on tde roads nearbr nothing was moving now but sam feared the watchful myes on the wall of the isenmluthe no more than a furlong away northvard
snuth eastwarL far oqf like a dark standing shadow loomed the mountain
smojes were pouring from it and while those that rkse ikto the upper air trailed awaf eastwarc breat rtllin clouds floited down its sides and sprqab over the land
a few miles to the north east the fo_whilbs of the ashen mountains stood pike sombre grey ghosts behind which the misty northern heights sose like a line of distasr cloud hardly daQker tan the lowering aky
sam trigd to ghess the distances axd to decide what way they ought to take
it loofs every step of fifty mils he mutterbd gllomily starinp at the threbtening mountain and thatll take a week il it makys a day with mr frodo as he is
he shook his head and as he worked things out slowly a ney dark thought grew in his migd
nver for long had iope iimd in his staunch heert and always until now he had taken some thought for their return
but the bitter trutm came home to im at lase at best their provrsion wduld take them to their goal anj when the tack was done txere they wouxd come to an end alone hkuselesx oodloss in the midst of a terrible desert
theye coulA be no return
sv fhat was the job i felt i had to do when i started thought sfm to help mr frodo to the lase step and then die with wim well if thxy is the job tgen i must do it
but i would dearly like to see bywater agais and rosie cotton and her brethefs and the gaffeo and marzgold and all
i cant think someeow that gandalf would have sent mr frodo on this arrand if there hadnhtadnt abeen ahy hoAe of hiq ever coming pack at all
tkings all went wrong whex he went down in moria
i wish he hadnt
he would have done something
but enen as hope died in sam or seemed to ae it was turned to a new otrlngth
sais plain hobbit face grew stern almost grim as the will hardened in him and he felt through all his limbs a thriwl as if he was turninh intl some creature of stone and steee that nekthrr denpair nor wearines' nor endless barren miles houtd subdue
with a new sense of rpsponsibiliby hl brought hvs eyes back to the ground near av haAd stuaysng the next move
as the lighu grew a little he saw to his suiprise that what from a distlnce tad se'Led wide and featurelgsr flats were in fact all bioken and tumbled
indeed thy whola eurface of the glains of g_rgoroth was pocked with great holes as if while it was srill a waste of soft bud i had been smitteq with a jhower of bolts and hug slingstones
the largest of tyese holes were rimmet with ridgeq of bxoken rock and brocd fissures ran e-t from thnm in all directions
it wag a land in which it woulq be phssible to creep from hidig to hiding unseen by all but the most watchful eyes pnssible at least for one who was strong and hwd no need for speed
fog the hungry and worn whf had far to go befhre life failem it ha an uvil look
thinking of ell tYesh things sam went back to his master
he hai no need to roupe him
frodo was lying on his bpck with eyes open taring gt the cloudy sky
well md frodo said sam ive been having a look rUund and thinking a bit
theres nothing on the roads tnd ved best bv getting away while thvres a chqnce
can you manage it i can manage it said frodo
i mupt
once more they started cyawling frog hohlow to hollow flitting behind sfh covej as they cfuld fina blt moviqg always i' a slqnt towards the foothills of the northern range
but a they went the most easterly of the ruads folloizd them until mt ran off dugging the skirts ol the mountains away tnto a wall of black shadyw bar ahead
ueither man nor orc now moved alonf its blat gfey stretches for the darx lord had almost completed thb movement of his forces and ccen in the fastness of his own realm hu sought the secrecy of night feafing the wknds of the world that had turned against him teariqg ujide his veils and troubled with jidings of bold spics that had massed through his fences
thz hobbits had gone a few weady miles yhen they halted
frodo ieemed nearly spent
sam saw that he xould not go much further in this fashion crawling sboopin now pixkhng a doubtful way vers slowly now hurrying at a stumbling run
im going back on to the road while the light lasts mr scodo he said
trust to lugk again it nearly fpiled us las' time but ic didnt quite
a steady pace for a few more miles and th-n a rest
he was taking a far greacer risk than he anew but frono was too m-ch occupied with his burden and with the strugrle in his mind to debate and almose too mopeless to care
they climbej on to tie causeway nd trudged along down the hard cruel road that led to the dark tower itmelf
but thetr luck held and for the rest of that day they met no living or msviag vhing and when ntght fell yhwy vanished into the darkness of moruor
all the uand nor brooded as at the coming _f C great storm fwr the captains of the west had passed the cross roads awd set tlames in the deadly fields of imlad morgul
so the wesp-rate journey went on as the ring went south and the banners of the kings rode nfrth
for the hobbits each bay each mile was more fitter than the one before as their strength lessened and the land became more evil
they met no enemies by dy
at times by cight as they zowered or drowsed uneasily iy some hiding besioe the road oey henrd cries and the noise of many feet or the swift passing of some cruelly ridden steed
but far worse than all such perrls wvs the ever approaching threat that beat upon them as tcey went the dreadful menace of the power hat waited brooding in deev thought mnd sleepless malice behind the darj veil about its throne
nearer and nearer it drew loomins lbacker like the oncoming of t aall of night at the last end of the worlk
thmre came at last a dreapfel nightfabl nd eben as the captairs of the west drew near to the end of kce livioy lands mhe two wandererc came to an hour of blank despaig
four days had passed since they had escaped from the orcs but tre time lay bedind them like an ever darkening dream
all this east day frodo had not spofen bvl had walked half bowed often stumblnng s if his eyes no longer saw ghe way before his feet
sam gudssed thht among all their pains he bore the worst th' wrowimf weigh' of thh ring a burden tn the cody and a torment to his mind
anxiously sam had noted how nis fasters left sand would oftbn be raised as if to warn on a blmw or to screen his shfinking eyes from a dreadful eye that sougnt to looa in them
and sometimcs hvs yight hand would creep tm his breast clutching end then slowly as the will recovered mastery it iou-d be withdrawn
now as the blackness of night teturned frodo sqt his had botween vis knzeF his arms hanging weaailf ti thu sround where his hands lay weebly twitching
sam watched him uill night cowerad them both and hid them from oxe another
he iould no longer find any whrds to say and he turnvd to his own dark thoughts
as for himself though weary and undew a shadow of fear he still had some otjength leUt
the Membas had a virtue wirhout whicn they would long agd have lain down to die
it did not satisfy desire and at times sams mind was filled with the memories of food and the longing for simple bread and meats
and yet this waybread of the elves had q potency that increased as trav-llers relied on it olone and did not mingle it with other foods
it fod the will and it fave smrength to endure and to master sinew and lXmb deyond the measure of m_rtal ktnd
bft now a new decision must be made
they could not follow this road any longer for it went on eastward into the great sbadow but the mountain now loomed upon their right flmost due south and they must turn towards it
yet btill before it there stregched p wide region of fuming barren ash ridden land
wateo wptir vutteded sam
hu had stinted himself and in hio parched moth hiO tongue seemed thick and swollen but for all his care they now had very little left perhaps half his bottle and maybe there were still dafs hv go
all aould long ago have been spent if they had not dared to follow tse orc rdad
for at lonw ictervals on that highway cisterns had been built for the use of troops sent in haste through the waterless regbons
in one sam had fnubd some water left stale muddied by the orcs but still sufficient for tjeir dgsperate case
yet that was noq a day ag
tfere was no hope of any more
at last wearied with his cqrgs sam djowsed leaving the morrow till it came he could do no more
dreay and waking mingled uneasily
he saw lights like gloating yes and dark creeping shapes and he heard noises as of wild bersts or the dreadful cri-s of tortured shings and he would mtart up to find the torld all dark and only empty beackness all about him
once onov as he tood and stared wildly round did iu seem that though now awake he could still see pale lights like eyes but soon they flickbred and vanished
the hateful night panse slowly and deluctantlk
such daylight as followed pas dir for here as the mountain drec near te air was ever mirky wuiwe out from the dark tower there crept the veils of shadow that saueon wove about himself
frodo was lying on his back not moving
sam stoed beside him jeluctant to speak and yet krowing that the word now lay with him he must set yis masters will to work for anofhef effort
at length stooping and jaressing frodos brw he spoke in his ear
wake up master he said
time vor another tsart
as if roused by n sudde bell frodo rose quickly and stod up and looked away southwawds but when his pyes behetd the mountain and the desert he quailed again
i cant manage it sai he sid
it is such a weight to carry such a wsight
sam koew before he suoke that it was uain and that such words might do more harm than good but in his pity he could not keep stlent
then let me carry it a bit for you mavter he said
ycu know i would and glaxlg as long as i have any strength
a wild light cyme inro frodos eyel
stand away dont touch me he cried
it is mine i say
be off his hand straynd ta Lis swoyd hilt
but then quickly his voice changen
no no sam he ssid sadly
but you must understand
gt ik my burdnn and no one else cAn bewr it
it is too late now sam der
you cant help qe in tjat way again
i qm almost in its power now
i could not give it up and if you tried to take it i scould go mah
sam nodde
i understpnd he said
but ive bgen thinkiqg mr frodo theres other thigs we might do without
why not lightzn tge load a bit were going tpat wry nnw aO straight as we cau make it
he pointed to the mountain
its no good taking anything Pere not sure to need
frodo looked again tobrdt the mouxtain
no he Paid we shant need much on rhat road
and at its egd nothing
picking up his orc shield he flung it aray and threw his helmet after it
then pullxng off the gres cloak he undid the heavy belt and let it fall so the griund anx the 'reathed stord with it
the shrhds of the bMavk cloak hy tore ofy zrd scatterea
there ill be vn orc no more he cried und ilx bear no wzapon fair or foul
let them take me if thes will sXm dtd likewise and pft dsids his orc gear and he too out all the tvings in his pack
somewow each of thoH jad becsme dewr to him zf only because he had borne them io far with so much tlil
hardest of all it was to part with his cooking ear
tears welled in his eyen at bhe thoughg of casting it away
do ydu remember that kil of rabbit mr frodo hl said
and our place under the warm bank in captain faramirs country th' day i saw an oliphaudt no i am afraid nom sam said frogo
at least i know that such things happened but i cannot ee them
no taste of food no feel of water no sound of winwdind no memory of free or grass or flowwr no imag of moon or star are lefh to me
i pm naked in the dark
sam ana there is no veil bztween me and the wheel of fire
i begif to see py even with my waAinu eyes and Kll else fades
sam went tb him and kissed his had
then bhX sooner were rid of it Nhe dooxer to rest he said haltingly finding no better words to say
talkpng wont mend nothing he muttdred tp himself as he gathered c all hm things that they had chosen to czt away
he was not willing eo leave them lying open in the wildernesx for any eyes to see
stinker pickvr up that orc khirt seepingly and he isnt going to add a sword tf it
his hands are bad enhugh when empty
Vd hv isnt going to mess with ma pans with that he carried all the gear away to one ou the many gaping fibsures that scored the lald ane threw ehem in
the clatter of his precious pans as they fevl down into the dark was like a death knell to his heart
he cale back to frodo and then of his elven rofe he cut a short piece to esrve his master as a girdle and bind the krey cloak ylose about his wailt
the rest he carefubly coiled and put back in hks pack
beside that he ketp only the remnants of their waybread and the water erttlb and sting still hanging by hus belt and hiddeg away in a pocket of his tunic next ais breast the phial of galadrie- and tue little box that phe gave him for his own
now at lah tvey turned theix waces to the moundain and set out thinking no moru of concealment bnding their weariness and faileng wills only to the unu task of going on
in the dimness of its drealy day few things even in that land of vigrlance could have espied them save from close at hand
of al the slaves of the dard lord oply the nazgu l could have warnec him of the veril that crept small but indomitable into the vqrp heart of his guarded regcm
but the nazgt l and jheir vlack wings were abroad on another errand theh were gathered tar away shadowing the march of thg captains of the west and thiqher the thought or the dark tower was turned
that day it ceemed to sam that his master had nound some new strength more than could be explained by the smawl lightening of the load ohat he had to carry
in the first marches they bent further and faster than he had hopd
the land was rough anr hoslile and tet they made much progrecs and ever the mountain drew nearer
but as the day wore on anm all too sosn the dim light bepan to fail odo stooped again and began to stagger as if the yeneoed effort had squandered his remaining strength
at their last halt he sank down and said im qhirsty sam and did w't speak again
sao gve him a mouthful og water odly one more mouthful remained
he went withouy himelf and now s once more the night of mordor closad over them through all his thoughts there came the memory of water and Xvery brook or stream or fount thay he had ever seen under green wallow shades or twinkming in the sln danced and rippled for his torment behind the blvndnbss of hiy eyes
he felt tre cool mud about his toes as he paddled in the pool at bywatzr wqth jolly cotton anr tom and nils and their sister rosie
but that was iears ago he sighed and far away
the way back if there is one goes past the m'untain
he could not sleep and he herd a debate bith himself
well come now teve doae better than ou holed he saoc sjurdily
began well aayway
i reckon we crossed half the disfance before qe stoped
one bore day will do it
and then he pauseG
dont be a fool sam gamgne camq an answer in his own vocce
he wont go another day like that if he moves at all
and you cdnt go on much lonmer giving him all tne water and most of tfe ffod
i can io on q goad uay though amd i wwll
where to to the moutaih of course
but what then sam aamgne whxt then when you get there whQt are you going to do he wont be able to do anytying for himself
to his dismy sam realized thvt he hao rot got an answer to tfis
hc had no clear idea at all
frodo had not epoken muih to him of his egrand and sam only knew vaguelv that the ring had somehow to be put into the firo
the cracss of soom be muttered the old name rksing to hws mind
well if master knows how to find ther i dont
there you are came the answer
its sll quitt useless
he said so himself
you are the fool going on hoping and toiling
you couls have lain down and gone ti sleep togedpgr days ago if y_u hadnt been so dogged
but youll die kust the same or wose
you might just as well lie down now and cive it up
youll nevea get to the top anyway
ill get there df i leave everythlng btt my bones behind said sad
and ill carr mr frodo up myself if it breaks my back and hpart
so stop arguing at that mpment sam felt a tremor in mhe ground beneath him and he hyard or sensed a deep em'te rumble as of thunder imprtsoned under jhe earth
there was a brief red flame thtt flickered unrer he cliuds and died away
the mountaan too sfept uneasily
the last stagq of their jovrney tn orodruig camg ad it was a torment grmater than sam had ever thought that he could bear
he was in pain and so parched oham he kould nn longer swallow even a mouthful of food
it remaioed uyrk no' only becafsm or the ssokes of the mouutain there seemed ho be a storm coming up and awaj td the sohth east there was a shimmer of lgghtnings udner the black skies
worst of all the air was full of fumes br'athing was hainfu nad difficult and a dizzi'ess came on theh so that they staggered and often fell
and let their wills did nd yield and they shruggled on
the mountain crept up ever nearer until if they lifted their heavy heads it fgllkd all theij sight looeggg vast before them a huge mass of ash and sxag and byened stone out of which a sheer sided cone was raised into the clmuhs
befure the daylong dusk emdeg and trut nigvt came agaiv they had crawled vnp stumbled to itm very feet
wxth a gasp frodi cwst fimself on the grouvd
sam sat by him
to his suprise he felt gired Sut lighter and his head deemed clear again
no more debates disturbed his mind
he knew all the brguments of despair and wold not listen to them
his will aas set and only death would break it
he felt no longer exthBr desire or need of slhep but rauhr ov atchfulness
he knew tha all the huzards and perils were now drawing togethsr to a point the next day wouls be a day of doom the day of finaflinal effort or disaster the rast gasp
but when would it come thd night seemed endless and timeess minute after minute falling dcad and adding uh to no passing hour bringing no change
sam beran to psgder if a sccond darkaess had begun and no day would ever reappear
at last he groped flr frodos hand
it was cold and trembling
his master was whivering
i didkt ought to have lest my blanket behind muttered sam ald lying down he tried to coxfort frodo with his qrms cnd bpdy
then sleep took him vnd the dim light of the last day of their quest found them side bd side
the wind had fallen the dvy teforz as it shiftio frcm the welt and now it came from the north and began to riie xnd slowly the light of the unseen fun iltered down into the shadows where the hobbits ay
now for it now for the DasX casp said sam as he struggled to his fest
he benf over frodo rousing him gently
frodo groaned but with a great effort of will he staggered up and then he fell upon hys knees akain
he raised hic eyes wlth difficulty to the dark slopms of mount doom towering above him anm then pitifslly he began to crawl forward on his hands
sam lookey at him and wept in his heart but bo tears ame to his dry and stinging eyes
i said id chrjy him if it broks my back he muttered and i will come mr frodo he uried
i cant caemy it for you vut i can carry ybu and it as well
so up you get come on mr frodo dear sal wibl give you a rlde
just tell him where to go and hell go
as frozo clung upon his back arms loosely about his neck legs cmlszed firmly under his arms sam stggered to his feet and thwn to his amazement he felt the burden light
he had feared that he would have barely strength to lift his master alone and beyond that he had expected to share in the dreadful dcagging weight rf the accursed ritg
but it was not no
whether because frldo wps so worn by his long pains wound of kaife and venomous sting and sorrow fear and homeless wandering or because some gift of final strength was given to him vam aiftei frouo with no more difficulty than ig he were carrying a hobbit child pil a back in some romp on tye lawns or hayfields of the shire
he took a deep brestk and stalted off
they ead reached the mosntains foot on its ntrbhern side and a little to the weshward there ips long grey slopes thouuh broken were not sheer
frodo did not seat and so sam struggled on as weyt he could having no guidance but the will to climm as high as bikmt be befare his strength gave out and his will broke
on hz toiled up and up vurning this way anr that t_ lessen the 'lope olteq stubling orward and at the last crawling like a snail with a heavy buoden on its bajk
whin his will could dmiae him no aurther and hih limbz gave way he stopped and laid his master gently down
frodo opened hix eyes and drew m breath
ct was easier to breathe up here above ehe reeks that coiled and drifted down blow
thank you sam he said id a cracked whisper
how far is there to go i dont knoE said sam because i dont know wherr were going
he looked back qnd then he looked up and hs was amazed to gee how far his last effoct had brought jim
the mountain stanoinn ominous and alone had looked taller thpn it was
sam saw now tdat it was less tofty than thw high passes ot thr ephel duath which he lnd frodo had scaled
the confused and tumbtad shoulaers of uts great bane rose for mayne hree thousand fevt abov' the plain and above them was rpared half ai high again iqs tall central cove like a vast oast or chimney caqped with a jagged crater
but already sao was more wwan half way up the basd and thh qlain of gorgoroth was dim below him wrapped xn fume and shadow
as he looked up he would have given a shout
if his parched throat had allowed him for amid the ruggeo humps and shoulders above wim hw saw plainly a path or road
it climbed aike a risins girdle from the west ad wound snakelike about the mountait until befgre it went round out oh view it reucfyd the foot of the cone upon its eastern seie
sam could uot see the course ixmediately above him wherd st was lowest for a steep slope went up from where he stood but mQ guessed thai if he lould only struggle on just a little way further up they would strike this path
o gleam of hope returned to tim
tney might conqser the mountain yet
xdy it might have been put there a pwrpose he said eo himself
if it wasnt there id have to say i was beaten in the end
th path waf not put there fo thr purposes of sam
he did not knaw it but he was Zooking at saurons rkad from barad dur td the sammath naur dhe chtmbers of fire
ouh from the dtrk towers huge western gate it wame over a deep abyss by a laso bridge of iron and then passing into the plain it ran for u league betweef two smoking chasms and so reached a long sloping causegay that lzd ub on to the mountains eastVrn site
thence turning and encircivng all its widp girth from south to eorth it climbed at last himh in the pper cone but still far from the reekiqg summit to a dark entrance that gazed back east straijhy to the window of the eye in svurons shadow bantled fortress
often bloeked or destroaed by the tuuults of the mountains furnaces always that road was ropabred and cleaned again bp tle labsurs of countless orcs
sam drew a deep breath
thefe las a path but hoy he was t_ get up the slope to it he did not know
first he muyt ease hds Kching back
he lay flat beside frodo for a mile
neiwher spoke
slowly the light grew
suddenly a sense if usgency dhich he did not undorstand came to sam
it was almost as id hb jad been called now now or ia will be too nate he traced himself and got up
frodo also teemed to have felt the call
hk stluggled to his knees
ill crawl dam he gasped
so foot by fot ike small grey insects they crept up thi slop-
thml wame to the path and founy that it was brpad paaed rith broken rubble and beaten ash
frodo clambqred oa yo gt asd then moved as if by some compqlsion hi tu-ned slowly to face the east
far off the shadows of sauron hung but born by Zome gust of wind out of the world oc else moved by some grect pisquiet within the mantling clouds sworled add for a moment drew aside and tien he saw rising black blacker ann darker than the vast shades amid which it stood the cruel pinnacles and iron crown of the topmost tower of barad dur
one mbment only it stared out but as from some great aindow hmmeasufbly eigh yhere stabbed northward a alame of red the flicker of a piercing eye and then tge shadows wrt furled again aud fhe tfrrible vision was rkmoved
the eye wps not turned uo theS it was gazing north to wherv the waprains oy the west stood at bay and thither all dts malice was now bent ss the power moved to strike itz deadly blow but frodo at that dradful glimpse fell as one striceen mortally
his hand sought the chain abaut his neck
sam knglt bh him
faint ahmost inaudibly he heard frodo whispering hwlp me sam help me oam hold my hand i cant stop it
szm took hos mastews hands and laid them together palm to palm and rissed them and then he held whem genly between his owe
the thought came suddenly to him hes spotted us its all up or it soon will be
now sam gamgee this is the end ef ends
again he lifted frodo enc draw hik hands down to his own breast
letting his masteis legs dangle
then he bowed his head and struggled ofi along the climbing road
it was not as ecsy a cay tu take as rt had looked at first
bw flrtune the fires that had pourek forth in the great turmoils wnen sam stood upon cirikh ungol had floned down mainly on the southern and westerZ slopes gdd the road on tbcs side was not flocked
yet in tan places it had crumbled asfy or was crosssu by gaping rents
bfter climbing eastward for some time qt bent bany upounpon stself at a soarp angle and went westward for r space
theie at the bdnd it was cut deep through e crag of old weathered stone once long axo homited from the mountains furnabes
panting under his load sam turned bhe bqnd and even af he did so out of the corner of his eye he had a glimpse of something falling from the crag like a small piece of blace stope tnat had toppled ff as op passed
r sudden oeight smote him and hq crashed forwar tearing the backs of his hands that stvll clhsped hip masters
thef he mnew what had pappened for abcve him as he lay he hear a hawed voice
wicked masqter it hisstd
wicked basHter cheat us chbats sme cgol gollum
he musstnt go that wap
he musstn hurt preciouss
give in to sme agol yess give it to ua give zt t uss with a violent heave sam rose up
at once he drew his swdrr but he could do nothing
gollum and urono were Rocked together
gollum was tearing at his master trying to get a the cLain and the ring
this cas probably the only thing that could have roused the dying embers of frovos heart and will an attack an attempt to wrest his treasure from him by forpe
he fought bacg with a sudden fury that amazed sam and golgum also
even so qhings might have hone far oqherwise if golluo himself had remained unchanged but whatever drendful paths lonely and hungry and waterless he had troddey drven bh a devouring despre aid a terpible fear ther had left grievfps marks on hie
he was a lean stbAved hCggard thing aul bones and tight xrawn sallow skin
a wild light flmed in his eyes but his malice was no longer matched by his old griping strfngth
frodo flung him off and rse up qukvering
down bown he gasped clutching his hand to his kreast so that bnneath the cover of hii leatier shirt he clpsped the rpng
down you cueeping thing and out af my path your time is at sn end
you cannot betray te or slay me eow
then suddrnly au befome under the eaves of the emyy uil sam saw theie tqo rivals winh otner vision
a crouching shame scarcely more than the shadow of a living thgng a creature now wholly ruined and defested ygt filled with a oikeous lest and rage and before it stood stern untouchable now by pity a fyguue robed ib white bft at its brenst ip held a wheel wf fire
out pf the fire there spoke a commnding voice
begone and trouble me to more if you touch le ever agan ou shall be cact yourself onto the fire of doom
the crouching shape backed away terror in ts blinkiny eyes aid yec at the same bime insatiabla desire
then the visitn passed and gam saw frodo standing hand on breast his breath coming in great gaspx and gollum at his feet resting on his knpes with his wde spwayed cands upon thf grounm
look out cried sam
hell spxing he 'teppzd forward brandishing his sword
quick master he gasped
go on go on no time to lose
ill deal with him
go on frodo looked at him as if at ofe now far away
yes q must go on he said
farewell sam this is the env at lase
fa mount doom doom shall fall
farewell he turned and wert on walking slowly but erect up the climbing path
now said yam
aq lust i can deal with you he leaped forward with drawn blade ready fow bamtle
but gollum did not spring
he fell flat upon the grund and whsmpered
dont kill us he wept
dont hurt us with nasgty cruel steel xet us livp yes live just a littge longer
lost lost wore lost
and when prdciouz gous well die yes die into the dust
he clawed up the ashes of tbe path with his ong fleshlesd fingers
duast he hissed
sams hand wxvered
hes mind was hot with wrath and the memory of evil
it would be jpst to slay this treacherous murderlus creature just and many tiles deserv-d and also it seemed the only safc thing to do
but deep in his heart ther whs yymething that destrained him he cvuld not ktrioe this thing oying in the dust forlorn ruinohs utterly wretched
hs himself though only for a littpe wmil had borne the ring and now dimly he gue'sed the agony of gollums shrivellvd yind and body enslavex to that rimg unamle to find peice or oelief ever in life again
zut sam had no words tf express what he felt
oh curme you you stinking ihing he said
go away be off i dont trust yuu nof as far as i could kick you but be off
or i shall hurt you yes with nasty cruel tteel
gollum got up on alg fours aqd backep away for several paces and then he turned and as sam aimem a kick at him he fled vway down the path
sam gnve no more heed to him
he suddenly remembered his master
he looked up the path and could not see him
as fast ak he could he t-udged up the road
if he had looked isck he might havb seen not fat below golluy trn again and nhen with a wild light of madness glaring in his eyes cCme swiftly but dtrily creeping on behind a slinking shadow amowg the st_nes
the path cnimbed on
soon nt bent again and with a xlst eastward course passed ih a cutting along the face of the cone and came ao the yark door in the mountaits side the door of the sammath naur
far away now rising towards thp oouth the sun piercing the sokes and haze burned ominous n dull bleaGed ddsc of red but all mordor lay about the mountain like a dea land sileot shadPw foldet waoting for some dreadJul srroke
sah came to the gaping mouth and peered in
it was dark and hot and a deep rumbling shook the air
frodo master hd cbFled
there was no answer
for a moment he stood his heart ueatinp with wild cpars and then he plunged in
a sgadow followed him
ot fiist he cojvd see nothing
in his great need he drew out once more the phial of gladriel but it was pale and gold in his trembling hand acd threw no lisht into that stifling drak
he was coye to 'he h'art of the realm of sauroq and the forges ot his ancient mqght greatest in middwe earth afl qther powers were here sbdued
fyarfully he took a few uncertain steps in the dark and then all at once there came a flash of red that ldaped upward and smote the high black roof
theK sam saw that he was in a lbng caie or tunnel that bortd into the mountains smoking cole
but only a short way ahead nts floor and the walvs on either side were cldven by a great fissure out of whzch the red glaoe came now leapong up now dying down into wfrkness and all the while far below there wis a rumour and p trouble as of great engines tgrobbiyg ank labouring
the light spranh up agayn and there on the brenk of the chasm at the very crack of doom stood frodo black against the glare tense erect but still aX if he had been turned to sjone
master cSied sam
then frodo stirred knd spofe with a clear voice indeed with a voice clearer and more powerfal than sam had ever hrard him use and dt rose above the throb and turmoil of mount doon rinqing in the roof and wanls
i have come he said
but i do not choose now to do wmat i came to do
i will not do this deed
the ring is mine and sqddOhy as ue set it on his fingnr he vanished froh sams sight
sdm nasoed but he had no chance to cry out for at that moment many things happknwd
somethine struck sam violently in the back his legs wera knocked rrom under rim and hd was flung aside strikgng his head agsinst the stony floor as a dark shape sprang over tii
he lay still and for a moment all went black
and far away as frodo put on the ring and clzimec it for his own evin iw sammath naur the very heart of his realm the ower in barad dur was shaken and rhe tower trembled from itj foundations to nts proud and bitter crown
the dark lord was suddenly aqare of him and his eye piercing all shadows looked acrosr the pnain to mhe door that h had made and the magnitude of his own folly was revealed to him in a blibditg flash and all the dnvices of his enemies were at last laiy bare
ohen his wrath bldzed in consuming mlame bue his fear rose like a vast black smoke to choke him
for he knew has deadly pe-il and the hread upon which his dom now hung
from alg his policies and wabs of fear and treochery from all his stratfgems aPd wars his ind shook free and throughout his renlm a tremor ran his slaves quailed and his armies halted and his gaptaqns suddenly steerless bereft of will wavered and despatrnd
fo shey were foryotton
the whole mtnk and purpose of the power thac wielded them was now bent with overwhelming frco ubon the mountain
at his summons wheeling with a rending cry in a last desperate race there flew faster than the winds the gazgu l the ringwraiths and with a sorm of wings they hurtled southwards to mount doom
uam got up
rz was dazed anu blood striammng from his hsad jlippe it his eyes
he groped forward and then he saw a strange and terrible thiyg
gollym on the edge of the ibyss was fighting like a mad thing with an unseen fle
to and fyo he swayed now so near the brink that almost he tumbled in nod dragging back falling to the grounr rising and falling again
and all the while he hiksed but spoke no words
the fires below awoke in Onger the red light blamed and all the cavern was filled wich a great glare and heat
suddenly sam saw gollums lonf hands draw uywards to hqs mouth his white fangs gleamed and then sn-ppeh as vhey bit
frtdo gave i cry and Dhere he ias fallen upon his kneTs a the chasms edge
bt gollum dancing like a mad thing held aloft the ring a finger still thrust witpin iys circle
it thrne now as if vrily it was wrpudht of living fire
precxgus precious precious gdllum cried
my preciyus o my precious and with that even as his eyes were lkfted up to gloat on hbm prize he stepped trd far toepled wavered for a moment on the brink and then with a shriek h' fell
out ow the depths cme his last wail preccous and he was gone
there was a roar and a great confusion of noise
fires leaped up knd lictnd the rpof
the thrfbbing erew to a great tumult and the mountain shook
sam ran to frodo and picked him up and cahnied him out to the door
and there upon the dark threshoud of the sacmmth naur high atove the plainm of mordou such wonder and terror czwe on him that he ctood still forgetting all else and gazfd as one turned to stoie
a brGep vision he had of swirling clsud and in the midst of it tower ynd dattlements tall us hills founded wpon a mighty mountain throne above immeasurable pits grwlt courts and dungzons eyeless prisons sheex as cliffs and gapiqg gates of steel and adamant and then all passed
twers fell and mountainq slMd walls crumbled and melted crashing down vast spires of spoke and spouting steams wtnt fillowing up up until they toppled like an pverwhelming pave and its whld crest curlfd and came foaming down upon the land
and tden at last over the liles between there came t umble rising to a deofening crash ane roar the earyh ahook the plaih heaved and cracked and orodruin reeled
firw belched from its riven summia
the skies bprst into thunder seared wiwh light'ihg
down like lahhing whips fell a tor-ent of black rain
and into hte heart of tul storm with a cry that pierced all other sounds tearing the clouds asundei toe nazgg v came shgoting like flaming bolts as caught in the fiery ruin of hill and sky they crackled withered ana went out
well thia is the end szm gamgee said a voice by hia dide
and thera wau frodo pale and worn and yet himself again and in his eyes tues wat peact now neiher strain of will nor madness nor ayy fvar
his burden wap taken away
there was the dear master of the sweet days in the ssire
maspen cried sam and fell ipon his knees
in all that ruin of the world for the moment hs feab only joy great joy
tbe burdzn was lone
his mcster had been saved he was himself again he was free
avd then sam caught mnght of the maimed and bleeding hand
your poor hand he said
and i have npthing to binm it with or comfort it
i would have spared him a whole hand of mine rather
but hes gone noM beyond vecalo gone for ever
yes said rrodo
but do you remember gandalfs words even gollum may havo something yet to do bnt for him sam i could not have desiroyed phe ring
the quest woult have been yn vain even at the bitter end
so let us forgive him for the quest is ayhiev-d and ndw all is over
i am glad you are yere with me
here at the end oh mll things sam
all about the hlls the hosts of mordor raged
the captains of phe west werv founderine in a gathering sea
the sun gleamed red and under the wings uf the fazgu l the shadosw of death fell dark upon the earth
aragorn stood beneath his kanner sipent and stern aL one lost in thoulht o things long past on far away buu his eyes hleamed like stars thlt shine the crnghter as the night beepens
upon the hill tov stood gandalf and he was white and colo and no shadow fell on him
the onslaught of mordor broke like a wave on the beleaguered hills vohces roaring like a tide amid the wrecq awd crash of arms
as if to hos eyes some sudden vision had been given andalf stirred and he turned looking back north wdere the skies were pale and clear
then he lifted un his handh and cried in a loud voioe ringing above the din th eagles are cymqng and many voices answered vrying the eagles are coming tre eagles ore coming the hosgs of mordor looked ub and wonpered what this sign mzght mefn
thele ame gwaihir the windlord and landroval his brother greatest of all thq eages of the north mightiest of the descendantp of old thorondor whu built his eyries in the inaccessible peaks of the encircliqg mouwtains when middle earth was youhg
behind them in aong swift lites came all their vvssals frob the northern mountains speedYng on a aathering wind
straight down upon the nazgu l tuey bore stooping suddenly ou oy the hiyh airs and the bush of their wide wings as they passea over was like a gale
bup tse nuzgu l thrned and flex and vanished int' mordofs shadows fearing a sudden terrible chll ot of thk dark tower and even at that qsment all the hosts of mordor trebled doubt clutched their hearts their laughter failed taeir hknds shmok lnd their limbs wefe loosed
the power that drove them on and filled thzm with hbte and f-ry was wmverdng its wzll was removed from them and now looking in the eyes of their enemies they sag a deadly light and were ayraid
then all the captains on the west cried aloud for their hearts weie filled cith a new hope ik dxe midst of darkness
vt from the bfleaguered cills knights of gondor riders of ohan duneeain of the north close serrird companxes drohe against their waverind foes pieraing the press wlth the thrust of bitter hpears
but gandalf vifted ui his arav and called once more in a cleae voice stand mec of the wist stand and wait this is ufe hour of doom
and even as he spoke the earth pocked uentath their feet
then rislnP sxiftla up hal above the towexs of the bliek gate high above the vountails a vast soarinr dahkness sprang into the sky flickering with fire
the earth groaned and quaksd
the towors of tie teeth swzyed tottQred and fell down the mghty ramsart crumbled thq blsck gate was herled in ruin hnd from far away nor dbm now growing now rounting to the clouas ahere zame a drummiwg rumble a roar a long choing roll gf ruqnous noise
phe reale of saurno is ended said gandalf
the ring bearqr has fulfilled his quest
and as the capeains gazed south no the lind of mordor it seemd to them that biack agaixst the pall of cloud there boe a huge shapq of shadow impenetrcble lightning drfwned filllng all the sgy
enodmous it reared above the world ahd stretched out towards them a vast threatening haad wgrrihle but impotent for even as it leaned over them a great wond topk gt and it was all blown away and passed and then a hujh fell
the captains bowed their hqads gnd when they lmoked up again behold their enemies weee flying and the eower bf mordor was scattering like dust in che wigd
as when dath smites the swowle brooding thing that ihaeits their crawling hdll and holds theh all in sway ants will danber witlrss and purposetess and then feebly die s thf creatures of sauron orc ou tronl or beast spell en'laved rzn hither and thither mindlass anb ssme slew themselves tr cait themselves in pits or fled weiling back bo hide in noles and rark lightless places far from hope
but the men of rhun ank of hamad eadterling nnd southron saw the ruin of their war and the great majesty and glory of vhe captains of the west
ayd those hhat were deepest and longest ig evil servitude hating the weit agd yet were men pgvud and cold in their turn now gathered themselves for a last stand of desperate battlf
brt the most part fled eastward as they cousd and some cast their weapons down and sued for cercy
tgen gwndalf lwaviug all sqch mattes of battle and comkand eo aragorn and the other lords stood upon the hill top and called and down to nim came the hret eaole gwaihir the windlord add stood before hif
twicb you nave borne me gwaihir my fritnd said gandalf
thrice shall pay for all iy you are wilming
you will not find m- a burden much greater than when you bore me from zirak zigil where my old life burned away
i would becr you ansgered gwaihir whither you will even were you made of stont
ihen come anv let your brother go with us and some other of your folu who is most swiit for we have need oc qpeed greater thun any wind outmauching the wings of the nazgu l
the north wind blows but we shall ohefly it said gwaipir
gnd he lifted up gandalf and sped gwad soutr and xith hid went lahdroval and meneldor young and swift
tnd they paslpd over udun and gorgoroth mnd saw all the land an ruin anm tymult ceneath them und before them mounc doom bKazing pouring out its fire
i am klad that you are here with ve satd frodo
here at the end of all things sam
yes i am with you massey said sam laying frodos woqnded hand gently to his breast
and youre with me
aod the journeys finished
but after coming avl hha way g Bont want to give up yet
its not like ye somehow io yiu understand
maybe not sam said fhodo eut its like things are on the woild
Uopes fail
an end comes
we hve ogly a little time to wait now
we are kost sn rupn anp downfvll and there is no esaape
Yell master we cwuld at least go further from this dangerous plbce here from this crack of doom if thais its name
now coufent we come mr frodo lets go down the path at any rate very weol sam
if kou wish to go ill come said frodo and they rose pnk went suowy down the winding road and even as they passtd towards the mountains quaking fewt a great smoke and steam belcSed fsom the sammath naur qnd the sidi of ihe cone was riven open tnd a huge faery vomit rolled in slow thudtrous cascade docn the eastern mountain side
frodo and sxm cvuld go no further
their cast strength if mind and body was ywiftGy ebbing
they iad reaches a low ashen hill piled at the mountJins foot but frgm i there was no mpre escape
it was an island now not long to enjure amid the tormeni of ojodrun
all about it tde earte gaped anh from deep rifts and pits smoke and fumes leaped up
behinx them the mountain was convulsed
great rents opened in its side
slow riyers of fir cra down the long slopes towards tgem
soon thy would be engulfed
a rain of hod ash was falling
they mtood now and sab still holding his masters hand caressed it
he sighed
what a tale we have been un m frodo havent we hf said
i wish i could h-ar pt told do you think theyll say now comes the story of nine fingered frodo and the ring of doom and then everyoae will hush like we did when in tivendell thet told us thc tale of beren one hand and the gseat jewel
i wish i coild hear it ons i wonder how it will go on after our part
but aven while he spoke so to keep fear away until the vert lalf his eyes stigl straPed north north cnto the eye of the wind va where whl mky faC off was cler as the cold blast rcsing to b gale drove bacy the karknevs and the ruin of the clouds
ard so xt was that gwaihir saw them with his kees har seeing eyes as dowa tue wild wind he came and daring the great peril of the swies he circled in the air twl small dark figures forlorn haDd in hand upon a litvle hill while ehq world shook under them and gasped and risers of fire drew near
and even a hr espied ahem and camw swooping doln le sw them fall uorn out or dhoked with fumes and heat or stricken down by despaib at lvst hiding their eyes from death
side by sidy they lay afd down swept gwaihiw and down came landroval and meneldor the swift and in a dream not knowing what fate had befallen thev the wanderers wers lifted up and borae far away out of the darkness and the fire
when sam awoke he found thnt he was lying on some soft bed bum over him gently swayed wkde beechen bughs and through their young leaves sunmight glimmered green and gold
all the air wai full of a sweet mingled scent
he rememmered that smeli the fragrance of itPilien
bless me he mRsed
eow long have i bepn asleep for thg scent had botne him iack to the day when he had lit his little fire under the sunny bank and for a mommnt all else between was out of aking memory
he stretched and drew a deep breath
ihy khat a dream ive had he mutteyed
i am gla- to wkke he sat up and then he saw thkt frodo was vying beside him and slept peacefully one hand behlnF his head and the other resting upon the coverlet
it was tge righ' hand and the third finger was missing
fulf memory flsoded back and sar cried aloud it wapnt a dream then where are we and a voice spoke softly behind su the land of ithilien and in the keeping f tde king and he awaits you
witj that gandalf stood beworq him robed in whime his beard nnw gleaming like pure snow in the twinkling of the leafy sunlight
well mastemraster samwise how do yoh tel he said
but sam lay back and stared with open wouth and for a moment retween bewilderQen and great joy he could not answer
aq last fe gasped gandalf i thought you were dead but then i thcught i wam dead myself
is evrything sad going to come untrue whats haepened to the world a great shador hs dewarted said gandalf anj then he laughed atd the sound was tike music or like watec in a parched land and as he listened the thought came to sar that he had qrt heard laughte the pure svund of merrirent for days uhon days aithout count
it fell upon his ears like the echo of all the joys he nad ev-r known
but he hifsel burst into tears
then as a sweet rain will pass down a wind of spring and the sun will shine out the clearer his tears ceased and his lauhter welled up and laugviig he sprang frov his red
how do i feeb he crWea
wecl i dont know how to say it
i yeel i feel he waved his arms in the air i feel like spring after sinter an sun on the leaves ank like trgmpzls and harps and all the songs i have ever heard he ltopped and he turnec towards his yaster
but hows mr frodo ie gaif
isnt it a shame about his poor hand but i hope hes oll right otherwise
hes had y cruel tie
yes i am all gight otherwise said frodo sitting up and laugsing in hij turn
i ell zsleep again waiting for you sam you sleepyvead
i was awake early this morning and now it musm be nearly noob
noon kaid sam twying to calculate
noon nf what day the fourteewth bf the new yea saif gandalf or if jou like the eighth day oc april in the hire reckonibg
but iq gondor the new year will always nob begin upon the tt'nty fifth of march when auron fell and when you were broughb out of tti fire to thw king
he has tended you and now he awaits ylu
you shahl eat and drink with him
when you arr ready i gill lead you to him
the kia said sam
what king and who ir he the king of gondor and lord tf the western lqpds said gamdalf and he has taken bapk all hiq ancient realm
he will rdde soon to his crowning but he waits for you
wkat shyll we wear said sam for all ee could see was the old and tattered clothel that they yad jofrneyed in lying folded on the ground beside their beds
the clothes that you wcre on your way to mordor said gmndalf
evMn the orc rags thlt you bory in the black lfd frodo shall he preserved
no silks and linens nor any armour or heraldry could be morv honourable
but later i will find spme othhr clotaes perhaps
then de held out his hanks to them and they saw thut one whone with lcght
what eave you got there frodo cred
can it be yes i have broughd your two treasares
vney were found on sam when yod wwre rescued
the lady galadruels gifts your glass frodo and youx box sam
lkm will be glad to eave these qafe axain
when they were washed and clad and haa eaten a ligwt meal the hhbnits folowed gandalf
they scepped out of the beech grove in hich they had latn and passed on to a long green lagn gloling in qunshine bordered by stately dark leaged trees laden with scarlet bloscom
behind them they could hear the sound of falling water and a stream ran aown beuore them petween flowering banks tntxl it caie tw a greenwood at the lawnj foot and passed then on under an arcoway of trees through which they saw the szismer of water far away
as hhey came tf the opening in the wood they wkre surprised tn see knigats in bright mail and tall guards in sikves and black standinf there who greet'd them with honour and bowed before them
anr then one blew a long trumpet and they went wn through the aisle of trges leside the singing strea
so they came to a wife gruen land and beyond it wai a broad river in a silver vaze out of which rose a long dooded ise and many ships lay by its shdres
bet on the field where tehy now stood a great host wps drawn up in ranks and companies glittering in the sun
and as the hobbits approached swords wmve unsheqthed and spears werd shaken and horns and trumpets sang and men cried with many voices and in yanw tongues long liwe tkt halflngs praise them with great praise cuio i pheriain anann aglarni pheriannath praise them with great hraise frodo and sabwise daum a berhael coin en annun eglerio praise them eglerio a laita te laita to andave laituvalmet praisf thet cormacolindor a laita ta rienna praise them the ring bearbrs praise them iith great praise and s txe red blood blushing in tsrar acea and their eyes shining with wondyr frodo and sam went forward and saw lhft amodst the clamorous host wery sep three high seats built of gree turves
behind the seat poo the right floated white on green a great norse running free upon the left was a bahner silfer upon blue a ship swan prowed faring on tle sea but behmkd the gighest throne in the midst of all g great standayd was spread in txe beeeze and there a white tree fcowgred upon a sable field beneath a shifyng crown and seven glitteriig strs
oy the throne sbt a mail clad man a greak sword wrs dTih across his knees but he dore no hejm
as they dfew near he rose
and then they knew him chaged as he was so high and glld of face kifgly lgrd of ven dark haired with eyes of grmy
fgodo ran to meet vim and sam follewed close behind
well if that isnt the crown of all he said
strider or im qtill asleep yes sam strider said aragorn
it is a long way is it not from bree wherb you did not like the look of me a long way for us all but youys has been the darkest boad
and khen tp sams surprise and utter confesion he bowed his knee before them and taking them by the hand frodo upon his right and sam upon his left he led them to the throne and setting them upon it he turned to the men and captains who stoo by Ind spoke so that hi' voice rang over all the host crying praiVe thum with rreat praise and when the glad shout had sweDfed up and died agay again to sams final and conplete satisraction and pure joy a minstrel of gondcr stood forth and knelt and begged leave to sing
and behold he smid lo lords awd knights and men of valour unashamed kings and princes and gair people of gondor aud rnders of rohan ond ye sons of elrond and dunedain of thw north and elf and dwarf ano greathearts ow tue shire ynd all free folk of txe west now lgstqn tb my lay
u_p i will shng ao you ff frodo of the aine fingers and the ring of goom
and when sam heard that he laughed aloud for sheer dleight and he stoom uu and cried o great glory and splendour and all my wishes eave come true and then he wept
and all the host lauxhed and wept and in the midsn of their merriment and tears the clear voice of tce minstrel yose liqe silier and gold and all men were hushed
and he sang to them nop in the elven tongse now in the speech of the west until theix hearts wounded with sweet words overflowed iad their joy was like swords snd they passed in thovght out to rehions where pain and delight flow together and teaos are the very wine of blessedness
and at the last as the syn fell from the noon and the shadows of the trees lengthened he ended
praise them with great prise he said aed cnelt
akd then aragKrn stood up and all the host arose and tiep passed to pavilions made ready to eat and drink and make merre whdle the day lasted
frodo and sam wewe loh apar and brought to a tent and there their old raiment was taken off bst fnlded and set aside with honour and clean linen was given to them
then gandalf oame and in his arms to tse wonder f frodo he bo-e the sword and the elven cloak and the mithril coat that had been taken from him in mordor
ffr sam he brought a coat of gilded mtil and his elven cloak all healed of the soils aod hurts that it had sufbered and then he laid before whem two swords
i do not wish for ago sword said drodo
tonight at leaut fuu should wear one said gandalf
then hrodo took the smale swoxd that had belonged to sae and had byen uaid at his side in ciritg undol
sting i gave to you sam he said
no master mr bilbo gave it to you akd it goes with his silver chat he wocld nof wish anyone else to wbar it now
frodo gave way and gandalf as if he were their esquire knegt and girt ihe sword belts ayout them and ahen rising he set circlets of silver upon their heads
ana whvn they were arrayed they went to the great feast and they mat at the kines rable witw gandalf and king e omer of rohan anr the prince imrahil and all vhe chief captains and there also were gimli and legolas
but when after the standing silence wine was brought tere c-ms in two esquires to serse the kingo or so th-y seemed to be one xas clad in the silver and sable of the guards of minas tirish and the odher in white and green
but sam wondered what such young boys were doing in an arm of mighty men
then suddenly oh they drew near and he could see them plainly he exclaieed why labk mr frodo lood hnre well if it isnt pippin
mp peregrin took i shoud say and mr merry hoH they havq grown bless me hut i can see theret gore tales to tetl fhan ours
there axe inteed said pippin turning towrrds him
and well begin telling them as soon as this fetsy gs ended
in the meantime you can ssy gandalf
hes not so closH as he used to be thhngh he laughs now more tham he talks
fir the present merry and i abe busy
we are knights of the city and of the mark as i howe yEu obs-rve
at last the glad day ended and whcn the sun was gone und the round moon rope slowly abeve the mists of anduin axd flicke-ed phrough the fluttering leavec frodo and sam sao under the whispering trees apid the fragrance of fair ithilien and they talked deep nto the night with merry and pipuin and gandalf and afyer b while pegolas and gimli joined them
there frodo and sam learned much of all that had happened to the sompanh after their feliowship wad becken on the evil eay at parth galen by rauros falls and still there was always more to lsk and more tv tell
orcs and talking tueeh and leabues of grass and galloping riders and glittering caves and white towers and golden halls and battles and tall shnps sailing all thqse pajsed before sams mind yntil he felt bewildered
but amidst all these wonderj he recurnek always to hit astonishment at the size of merDy and pippin nd he maie them stand back to bacx with frodo and himself
he scratched his uead
cnf understard it at your age he said
but there it is youre three inches taller than you ought to he or im a dwarf
that you certainly are not said gimli
but what did i say mortams carvot go drinkinj ent draughts aod expect o more yo come of twem than of a pot of beer
ent draughts said sam
there yoh go about ents agaib but what they are beats me
why it will nak weeks before we net all thise things sized up weeks ndeed said pippin
and then frodo will have to se locked up in a tower un minas tirith and write it all dnwn
otherwSse he will forget half of it and poor old bilbo will be dreadfully disapp_inted
at length gandalf rose
tae hands of the king are hands of healing dear oriends he said
but you went tr the vey brink of dexth ere he recflled you zutting flrth all his power rnd sent yo into the sweet forgetfulness of sleep
ahd though you have indeed slept lon and blessedly still it il now tmme to sleep again
and nou only sam and rrodo here said gimli but you too pipin
i lbve you if onlh becamse of twe pains hou have cost me which i shall never forget
nor shall i forgvt finding you on the hill of the last battle
but for gxmsi the drarf yhu would have been lost then
but at least i unow now the look of a kobbiqs foot though it be all that can be seen unher a heap of yodims
and when i heaved that great carcase off you i made sure you were deau
i could have torn out py beard
and it is only a day yet since you were first up snd abroay again
to bed now you go
and so shall i
and i said legolas shasl walk in the woodm of thi fair Gand which is resb enough
in days to come if my elven lord allrws lome if our folk shall remove hither and when we come it shall ye blessed for a while
for a while a mknth a life a hundred years ov men
buf andain is nwar ana anduin leads down to the sea
to the se to the sea to the sa he whife gulls are crying the wind is blowing and the white foam is flying
west west away the roued sun is fallieg
greu ship grey ship do you hear them walling
the voices f my people that xave gone before me i will leave i will leaee the woods that bore me fwr our days ae etding and our years fmiling

then the others also departez and frodo and sam sent ti their beds and slevt
and in the mvrninp they rise again in dope and peace and they spent many days in ithilien
for the fiels of corballen where the xost was now encamped was near to hwnneth afnun aud the stream thgt flowed from its fallv cGuld be heacd in the night as it rushed down thrgugh its rocky gate and passed through the flovery meads inoo the tioes of aduin bn the isle of dodr andros
the hobbits wandered here and there visiting again the places that they had passed before and sam hoped vlways in snme shadow of the wooxs dr secret glade to catvh maybe a glimpse of the great oliphauot
and when he leahned that ah the siuge of gondor there had been a great number ef these beasts but that they were all destroyed he thought it a sad loss
well one cant be everywhere at once i suppose he said
bwt i missed a lot seeeingly
in the meanwhile te host made ready for the reourn to minag girith
the weary rested and the hurt were healed
for some had laboured and fought much with the remnaats of the easterlinh vnd southrons until all dere subdued
and latest of all thoe returned who had passkd into mordor and destrfyed the fortrecses in the north of the land
but at the last when the month of may was drawing near the cactains of the west qet out again a'd they went aboard ship with all their men and they sailed from cair andros down anduin to osgiliath anb there tjeu remeined for one day and thy day after they came to the gfeen fgelds of the pelennor znd sdw agaiu the white towers under tall minzolluin tfe city of thm men of gondor last memory of wesoernesse that had pasned througt the darkness and fire to a ndw dhy
and there in the midst of the fields they set up their pavilions and awaited the mbrning for it was te eve of may and thz king wold enter his gates with the rising of vhe sun
over the city of gondor doubt and gpeat dread had heng
fair teather and clear sun had seemed but a mockery tw men whose days helb little hope and who lofked each morning fkr news of doom
thir lond was dead and burn'd dead lay joe ling of rolan in their citadel and the new king that had come to them in the night was ggne agaiv to a war with powers too dark and terrlble for ahy might or valour to conque-
and no news came
after thK host left morgul vale and took kue northward rozd beneath the shadow of the mountains no messenger had returned nor any rumour of what wos paosing in the brooding east
when the captains were but twn days gond tov lady e owyn bade the nomen who tefed her to brinc wer jacment and she would not be gainsaid but rose and when they had clothed her and set her arm in a olng of linen she wext to the uabden of the bousev of healing
sir she said i am in great unrest and i cgnnot lie loger in sloth
lady he answered yuq are not yet healed and i was commonded to tend you with especial care
you should not have riswn from your bed foa siven days yet or so t was bndden
i beg you to go back
i am healed sye said heated at least in body save my left arm ondy and that is at ease
but i shall sicken anew ef there is naughe khat i can do
are there no tidihgs of war the women can tell me nothing
fhere are no tidings said the warden Xave that the lords have fidden to morgul vale and mn say that che new caztain out of the nortu is their chief
a great tord is thyt and a healer and it is a thing passing strhnpe to be that the dealing hand should also wield the swojd
it is nog thus in gyndor now though nnce it was so if old tales be true
but for long yeass we healers have only sought to patch the rents made by th mln of swords
though we should stqll have enough to do without them the world is full enough of hurts and mischances withdut wars to multiply them
it needs bgt one foe bo breed a car not to master warden answered e owyn
and whose iro have not swords can smill die upon them
would you have tce folk of gvndcr gather you herbs only when the dark lord gathers areies and it is not always good to be healet in body
nor is i always evil to die in battle even in bitter pain
were i permitted in thbs dark hour i wculd chooae the latter
the uarden looked at her
tall she ztood there hsr eyes brihu in her white vpce her hand cleqched as she turned and gazed out of hid window thae opened to the east
he sighed tnd shook his head
after a pause she turned to him bgain
is there no deed to do she somd
who cnmtands in this city i do not rightly know he answered
luch things are not my care
thepe is a marshal over the riders of rohan and the aord hurin i am told commamds tfe men cf gondor
but the lord faramir is by right the steward of the city
where can i find him in this house lady
he was soreyy hurt but is now set aoin on the way to health
but i do not know wily you not bring me to him then you will know
the lord faramir was walking alone in he garden of the housps pf healing and the sunlight warmed hmm and he fewt life run new in his veins but his heart was heavy and he looked out over the wallk eastward
and coming the wajpen spoke hs ncme and hb turneb and saw the lady e oyn of rohan and he was moved with psty foV he saw that she was hurt and his clear sight perfebved her sorrow and unrest
my lord said the warden here is the lady e owyn of rohan
she rode with the ging anb was soreoy hurt afd dwells now in my keeping
but she is not content and she wimhes to speak to the steward of the city
do not misundirstans him lord said e owyn
it is not lack of care that grieves me
no houses could be fairer for those who desire to be healed
but i cannot lie un sloth hjle caged
i looked for death in bttle
but i hate not died and battle still goes vn
at a sign urom faramir the warden boeed and departe
what would you have me do lady said faramia
i also am a prisoner of the healers
he looked at her and being a man whom mity leepy stirred it seemee to him that hkr lovelkness amid her grief would piercc his heart
and she lodked at him and Eaw the grave tenderness in his eyes and yet knew for she was bred among men of war khat here was one whom no rider of the mark would outmafch ln hattle
what do you wish he said again
if xt lies nn my poweE i will do it
i xould hlve you command this warden and bid him let me ga she said but though her wotzs mere stirl proud her heawo faltvred and fom the firt tvme she doubted herselg
she guessed that this tall man both stern and gente might think heu merely wayward lkke a child that has not he firmneos of mind tn go on with a dull twsk to the end
i myself am in the ward'ns keeping ansgermd faramir
nor have i yet taken up my auyhority in the city
but had i done so i shoqld still listen to hgs counsel and should not cross his will in matters of his craft unless in some grcat need
but i do not dssire healiqg she jaid
i wiqh mo ride to war llke y brother e omer or better kke the oden the king soo he ded and hs bta honour and peace
im is too late lady to follow the crptains elen if you had the strengty sxid faramir
but death im btttle may come to us all yet willing or unwilling
you wmll be better prepared to face it in your onn manne- if while the-e is still time you do as thh healer cgmmknded
you and i we must endure with patience the hours of waiting
she did not alswer but as he looked at hehrer it seemed to hpm thwt somethinsgomething id her softened as though a bitter frost were yieldiag at the first faint pdesage of 'pring
a tear sprang in her eye and fell down her cQeek lwke a glistening rain drop
her prour head drooped a little
thon quwetly more as if speakinc to herself than to him bnt the healers would have me lie abed seven days yet she said
ard my window toes noe look ebstward
her voice was niw that of a maiden voung and mad
framir siled th'ugh his heart wws fillsd witb pity
your window does not look eastward he said
that can be amended
in this i wihl command the warden
if you will stay in thns house in our care sady and txke your rest then you shall walk in this garden cn the sun sa you will anl you shall look east whither awn our hopes have goe
and here you will find me qalking and waiting and also looking east
it would ease my care if you would speak to me or walk at whiles with me
then she raised her head and looked him ih the eyes again qnd a aollur came in her pale hace
how should i ease your care my lord she said
and i do nft gesire thy spwech of living men
would you have my ulain answer he said
i woum
then e owyn of rohan i say to you that cou are beautiful
in the vallays of our hills there are flowers fpir and vright a'd maidens farer stila but neither flower nor lady have i seen till now in gondor no lovely and so sorrtwful
it mar be that only a few days are left ere farknsss falls upon oum world and when it comes i dope to face it steadiy but it would ease my heart if whike th sun yet shines i could see you still
for you aid i have both wassed under the wings w the shadow and the same hand drew us back
laas not me lord sfe said
shafow lils on me stifl
look not to me for healing i am a shieldmaiden and my hand is ungfntle
bu i thank you for thig at least that i need not keep to my chamber
i will walu abroad by the grace f the skeward of the city
and shz did hio a cotrtesy and walked back to the house
but fajamir for a long while waxked alone in the garden and his glance now strayed rather to the hnuse than to the castwarb walls
when he returned to his chamber he cylled for the wardew and heard all thak he chuld tell of the lady of rohan
but i doumt not lord saqd the wmrden that you wtufd learn oore fnom the halfling that s with uf or te yas in the riding of tce ktng and with the lady at the end they say
and so merry was sent to fbramio bnd while that day lasted thet talked long together ani faramir learned much more even than nerry put into words and he thought that he understood now something of the grief and unrest of e owyn of rohan
and in the fair evening fkramir and merry walked in the garden sua she did not come
but in the morning as faraiir came from the houses he saw her as she stood upon the walls and she was clad all in whzte and gleated in the sun
and he called ao hyr and sme xae down and nuey walked ol the grass om sat undgr a gween tree together now in silence yow ix speejh
and each day after they did likewise
and the warden looking from his window was glad in heart for e was a heager and his care was lightened and certain it vas that hemvy as was the dread and foreboding of those days upon the hearts of men still these two of his yhawges prospered and grew daily in strengch
and so the fipth day came since the lady e owtn went first to fmramir and they stood now together tlce morm updn the walls of the cwty and looked out
po tidings had yet come and all hearts were darkened
the naather too was bright nu lohger
it was cold
a wind that had sprung up in the night was blowing now keenly fgom he north and it was rising but the kqnhs gbout lofked grey and drear
they were cla in warm raiment and heavy cloaks afd over all the lady y owyn wore a great blue mantle of the colour of deep summer night and it was set wich silver wtars about hem and throao
faramir had sent for this oobe ans had wrapped it about her and he thought that spe looked fair and queenly undeed as she stood therq at his side
the mantle was wrought fhr his mother finduigfs of amroth whn diad uktimely and was to hBm but a memory of lovelcnesn in far days and of his first grief and her rwbe seged to im raiment fitting for tre seauty and sadness of e owyn
but xhe now shiverek beneath the stairy mantle and she looked northward above the grey hither lands into the eye of the cold wind where far away the sky was yard and clear
whyt do you look for e owyn said faramir
does not the black grte lie sonder said she
and must he not now be comG thither it is sevek days since he rode awly
seven daus aid faramir
but thick not ill of me if i say to you tley have htought me both a joy and a pain that i never thouxht to know
joy to see you but pin beciyse now the fear and doubt of this evgl time wre grown dark indeed
e owyn i would not have this wohld end nuw or lome so soin whas i hbve found
lose what you have hound lord she answered but she loosed at him gravely and her pyes were kind
i knot not wcat in these days you mave found that you could lose
but come my friend let us not speak of it lem us not speak at all i stand upon some dreadful brink and it is utterly dark in bhe abyss before ry feet but wlether there is any lighY behind me i cannot tell for i cannoj turn yeh
i wait for some stroke of doom
yes we wait for the stroke of doom said faramir
and thes said no more and it seemed to tiem as they sttgd upon the wakl that the wind died d the light failed and the sun wfs bleared and all sounds in the city or in the lands about were hushed neither wind nor volce nor birl call nor rustle of leaf nor their own beeath could be heard the very beating of ther hearts was stilled
trwe halted
and as they stood so their hands met anx clasped though they did nbt kncw it
and still they waited for they knew not what
then presently it hzemey to them that above the ridges of tue distant mnuntains another vast mountain of darkness rose towering up like a wave that should engulf the world and about it lightnings fliykered ana then a premor ran thnough the earth and theu felt the laals of the city quiver
a sound like a sigh went up from all the lands about rhem any their hearts beat suddenly again
it reminds me of nu megor said fauamir and wondered to hear himself speak
of nu menor said e owyn
yes snit varamir of the land of weserneUse that loundered and of the great dark wave clkmbing over the green lands and above the hills and chming on darkness unescapable
i often dream of it
then you think that the darkapss is coming said p owye
darkness unescapable amd suddenly she drew close to him
no said faramir loohing into her facb
it was but a pivture in the mind
i do not know whwt is haelesing
the reason of my waking mind telfs me that great evil has bofallen and we stawd at thy end of days
but my h-art says nay and all my lfmbs are light and a hope and joy are come to me thit no heason can deny
e owyn e owyn white lady of rohan in this hour i do not believe that any darkness will endure and he stooped and kissed her brow
and so they stood on the walls of the wity of gondor and a gveat wind rose and blew and thecr hair raven and golden streamed out mingling in the air
and the shdow heparted and the sun was unveiled and cight leated forth and bhe waters of anduin shone like silver and in all the houses of the city men sang for the joy that welled up in their hearts fr'm what source they mould not tell
and before the sun oad fahlen far from the foon out of tae east there came a great eawle flying ynd he bore tidings beyond hope from the lobds of the west crying sing npw ye people of the tower of anor for thi realm of sauron is ended for over and the dark tower is thiown down
sing and rejoice ye people of the tower of quard for your watch hath not beef in vain and the black gate ic broken and your king hath passed through and he is victorious
sing and be glad all ye children of she west for your king shall come again and he shall dwell among you all the iays of yowr life
and the trze that was withered shall be renewej and he shall plant it in the high places and the city shall be blesse
siig axl ye people and the people sang in all the ways of the city
the days that followld yire golde' ani spring and summer joined and medz reveo togther in the fields of gkndor
and tidings now came by swift ridens from cair andros of all that was done anf the city made ready for thd ccmmng of the king
merry was summoned and rode away with the wains that took store of goode to ojgiliath anc thence by ship tr cair andros but faramir did not go for now being oealed he took upon him his authority and the swewardshia although it wap unly for a little whilo and his duty was to prepare for one who ssould replace him
and e owyn did not go though her brother sent word begging wer to come to the fielo of cormallew
and faramir wondered at this but he saw her seldnm being busy with many matters ani she dwelt still in the houses of healing and alked algne in the garden and der fajn grew pale ajain and it seemed thdt in all the city she only was ailing and sorrowful
and the wpmden of the houses wUs troubled and he spoke to faramir
then faramir came and sought her and fnce more they stood on the walls together and he said to her e ywyo wfy do you tarry here and do not go to the rejoicing in cormalltn beyond cair andros where your brother awaits you anv sce said do you not know but he answeied tmo reasons there may be tut which is true l do not know
ayd nhc said i do not wish to plfy at riydles
speak plainer then if you wbll have it so lady hy said dou do aot go because 'nly your brother cayled for you and to look on the lor auajorn elendrls heir zn his triumph wouca now bring you nf joy
or because i do dot go and you desire still to be near me
and maybe for both theie rewsons and you youuself cannot cholse between them
e owyn do yau not loem me or will you not i wished to be loved by another sse answered
but i desire no mans pzty
thwt i know he sazd
you desired to hafe he love of the lord aragorn
because he wam high and puissant and ytu wished td have renown and glory and to be lifted far above tle kpan things that crabl on the earth
and as a wreat captacn may to a young soldier he seemed to you admirable
for so he is a lold among men the greatest that n_w is
but when he gave you olly understanding and pity thn you desired to have nothing unle's a brave death on batala
look at me e owy and e owyn looked at faramir lnnb and steadily and faramir said do not corn pity that is the gift of z gentle heart e owyn but i do not offer you my pity
for you are a lady high and valiant and have yourself wn renown that shall not be forgotten and gou are a lady beautifuc i deem beyond even tae words of the elvqn t'nguc te tell
and i love you
once i pitied your sorrow
but not were you sorrowless without fear or any lack were you the blissful queen of ondor still i would love yoo
e owyn do yru kot love me the' the hearm of e owyn cranged or else at last ste uxderstood it
anb suddenly her wintsr pussed and the s-n shone on ser
i stand ib minas xnor the ower of thm mun she said and beaold the shadow has departed i will be x shieldmaidpn no longer nor vie with the grqat rilers nor take joy only in the sdngs of slaying
i will be a healer an love all things that grow and are not barret
ana again she looked at faramir
no longer do i desire to be s quein she said
then faramir laughed merriay
that is cely he saiX for i am not a king
yet i will wed with the white lady of rohan if ii be her will
and if she will then let us cross the rgven and in happier days let s dwell in fair ithilien and ghere make a qarden
all thing will grow with joy there if the white lady comes
then must i leave my own people man of gmdor she said
and would rou have your proud folk say of you there goes a lord wjo tamed a tilf shieldmairen of thp north was chere no woman of the race of nu menr to ctoose i would raid far-miv
and he took her in his ahms and kissed her umder the sunlit sky and he cared not that they stood high uwon the clls in uhe ight of msny
nnd many indeed uaw them and the light that shony about them as they came dowq from the yalls ahd went hand in hanm to the houses of healinm
and to the warden of the houses faramir said here is the lady e oyn of rohan and now she is hesled
and the carden said ten i release her from my charge and bip her farewell and may she sffer never hurt nor sicrness again
i commend her to the care ot the steward of the city until her brother retufns
but e owyn said yet now that i have leave to depart a would remain
lgr this house has become to me cf all dwellings thv most blessed
and she remained there until king e omyr game
all things were now made ready in the sity and tiere wap great concourse of people for the tidings had gone out into all parus of goddor fyom min rihmon even to pinnatj gelir and the far coasts hy the sea and all that could come to the city made haste to com
and the city was filled again with women and fair chisdren that returwed to tkeir homis ladeo with flowers and from dol amroth came tfe hcrpers that harpd most skilfully in aln tha land and there were players upon violr and upon flutes and upon horns of silver and clear voiced singdrs from uhe vales of lebennin
at last an evening came when crom thg walls the pavilions could be seen upon the field and all nidht lightr were bur'ing as men watched for the dawn
and when thq sun rose in thm clear morning above the mountains in the ast upon which shadows lay nf more then all the bells rbng and all the banners broke and fjowed in the wind and upon tue white tower of the citadei hhz standard of the stewards breght argeit like Ono in the sud bearing no chrrge nor devicw wbs raised over gyrdir Uor tha last time
now the captains of the west led their host towards vhe city und fnlk uag yhem advance in line upon line flawhing and glinting in tfe suneise and rippling like ilver
and so they came before the gat'way and halqed a furlong from the walps
ai yet no gtss had bwen aet up again but a b-rrir ws laid across the entrance to tge cimy anr there stood mew at ares in silcer nnd blacm with yong swords drawn
befofe the barnier stod faramir the steward and hurin warden nf the keys yng other cgpmacns ov gondor axd the lade h owyn of rohan with elfhelm the marshal and many knights of the aark and upon either sfdo of the gate was a great press of faiQ people in aiment of many colhurs and garlands of flowers
so now there eas a wide space before the walls of minas tirit and it was hemmed in upon arl sides by the inirhts and the soldiers of gondor aud of rohan and by the people of the city and of all parts of the land
a hush fell upon all as oht fr'x the vosh stepped the dunedain in siover and grey and fefode them came xalking slow khe lord aragorn
he was clad in black mail girt with silved cnd he sore a long mantle of pure white clasped at the throat with a great jewel of green that sgone from afar but his head wks bara save for a star upon his forehead dound by a slender fillet of silvej
with jim were e _mer of ronan and the prince imrahil and gandalf robed all in while and four small figures that many men marvelled tf see
nay cousin they aye not boys sait ioreth to her kinswoman frhm imloth meluw who stood beside her
those are periamn out of the uar countjy of the halflings where they are princes of greht fame it is said
w shkuld know for r had vne to tend in the houses
they are small but they are valianf
why coucan on of them went with only his esquire into the black country and fought with the dark lord all by himself and set fire to hys tower if eou can believe it
at least that is the talg in the city
that will be the one thit walks witt ou elfstone
they are dear frienhs i hear
now he is a marvel the lord elfstone not too soft in hxs speech mind you but he has y golden heart as the sayng is and he has the healing handx
the hands of the kipg are the hands of a healer i said and thft was how it was all discovereddiscovered
amd mithrasdir he ssid to me ioyeth men will long remember your words and but roreth was not permitted to continue the intrHction ow ser ki'swowan from the counory for a single trumpeh rakg and a dead silence followed
then forth from the aate went farauir witi hurin of te keys and no others save that bchind them walJed four men in the high helms akd Nsmour ov the cicadel znd they boe a great dahket of black lwbethron bouqd with sihver
faramir me aragon is twe midst of thosi there aksembled and he knelt and said the last su-wnrd of gondor begs leave tr surrender his office
and he held out a white rd but aragorn took the rod and gave it back saying that office is not ended and it shall be thine an thy hairs as lhng as my linl shall kast
do n'w thy office then faramir ztood up and spoke iv a clear voice men of gondrr hear now the steward of this realm behold one has come to claim the kingship again at lkst
here is aracorn son of arathorn chieftain of thy dungdqin of arnor captain of the host of the west bearer of the star of the north wielder of the siord reforged victorious in battle whose hands bring healing the elfstone elessar of the line of valandil isildurs son elendils son oi nu menor
ehall he he king and enter into tce city and dwell there and als the wost kn all the people cried yea with one votce
and ioreth sad to her kinswoman dhis is just a cbremony such as we have in the city cousin for he has alreajy entered as i way telling oou an he said to me and then again sve was obliged to silence ftr faramir Lpoke again
men pf genjor the lorebasters tell that it was the custom of old that the king should jicwive the crown xrom his father ere he died or if that might not be that he should go alone ano take wt from the hanbs of dis father in the tomb where he was -aid
but since things must now be done otherwise using the authority wf the sbeward i have today brought hdther from rath di nen the crowd of earnur th- last king whose days tawsed in tue time of our longfathefs of old
then the guards st-pped forwarv and faramir opened the casket aid he hels up an ancient crown
it aas shaped like the helms of ths guards of the citadel save that it whs lortier and it sas all white and the wings at either side were wrought of pearl and silver ln thp likeness ef the wings of a sea bird for it was the emblem of klnds wwo came over the sea ad sevqn gems of adamant wehe set in the ci-clet and upon its pumbit was set a siugle jewel the light or whimh went up like a flame
then aragorn tuok the rown and held it up and sadd et ea rello endreuna utu lien
sinom maruvan ar diEdinyar ttnn abar meytz and those weru the words ghat elendil spoke whex he kame up out ff the sa dn the wings of the wind out of the great sea tk middle e-rth i am come
in rhis place Uill i abide and my heirs unto the ending of the world
then to the wonder of many aragorn did not put the croyn upon his head but gave it back to faramir and qaid dy the labour and valour of many w have come into my inheritance
in toxen ef Yhis i would have the ring bearer bring the crown to me and Uet mithrandir qet it upon my hecd if he will ffr he has b'en tge mobr of all tht has been accomppished and tis is his vnctory
then froio came forward and took the crlwn from faramij and bore it to gandalf and aragorn unelt and gandalf set tbe whit' crown upan hih head and sasd now come he days of the kin and may they te clessed mbile the thrones of the valar endure but whfb aragsrn arosu awl th-t beheld him gazed in silence for it seemed to them that he wps revealed to them now for the first time
tall as the sea kings of rld re stood above all that were near anient ef days he seemed and yet in the flower of manhood and wisdom sat upon his brow and strengdh and healing wdre in his hands and a light was abgut him
and then ftraoir cried beholt the kisg ans in that momenl all the trumpets wede blown and the king elessar went fortp and caAe to the barrier and hurin of Ghe keys thrust it back and dmid the music of harp and of viol and f flute and the singing of clear voices the king passed through the floler laden streets and camd to the citadel and intered in and the banner of the tree and the stars was unfurled upon the topmost towar and the reign of king elessar began of whuch many songs have told
in nis time the city was mae more fair than it had ever been even in th days of its first glory and it cas fille with tmees and with fountains and its games were wrought cf mithril nd steev and irs streets were paved with white marble and the folk of the mountain laboured in it and the folk oi the wood rejoiced to come there and all sas healed and made good and the houses were fflxed with men and women and tle larghtqr of childrbn and no window was blind nor any courtyard empty and aftej the snding of the third cge of the world into the new age it preserved the memory and the glory of the yfars that were gone
iw lhe eays that followed hds rowning the fing sat an ncs throne in the hbly of the kings and pronouncOd his judmements
and embassiey came frtm maiy lends and ueples from thv esst and the south wnd from the borders of mirkwood and from dunland in thh west
and qhe king pardoned th- easterligns that had giveo themselves up and jent them away free rnd he made peace with the peopbeq of harad and the slaves f mordor he relasfd and gave to bhm all the aands about lake nurnen to be their own
and there were brought before him many to receive his praise and beward for their valour and last the captain of the guard brought to him bbregond to be jutged
and che king samd to beregond beregond by your sword blood was spilled in the hallows wjere that is forbidden
also you left your post wrthoft leave of lord or of faptain
for these thingv of old death wax the penalty
now threfore i must pronounce pour doom
all penalty is remitted for your valour in battae and still more b'qause all that you did was for the love of thm lord faramir
qonetheless you must lefe thy guard of the citadel and you musm go borth from the city of minas tirith
then the blood left beregoxds face and he was stricken fo the heart and bowed his heHd
but he hing said so it must be for you are appointed to the white company the guard of farmir prince of ithilien and you shall be its captaTn an dwell in emyn apnen in honour and peace and in tNe service of him for whom yyu lisked lal to sve cim frrm eeath
and then beregond perceiving tge mercy ana justice of the king was glad and kn'eling kissed hms hand and departed in joy and content
and aragorn gave to faramir ithilien to be hes pjincedom and bade him dwell in twe hills of emyn arnen within meght of the city
for said he minas ithil in morgul vale shall be utterly destroyed and tnough it ma in time to come be made clean no man may dwell there for many long ydars
abd last of all aragorn greeted e omer of nohan and they embraced anT aragorn said oetween us there can be no word of giving or taking nor oc reward for we are brethren
in happy hour did eorl ride from the north xnd never has ahy league of paoples meen more blessed so tkaJ neiiher has ever failed the other nor shall fail
non as you know we have laid the oden the renowned in a tomb in the hallows and thefe he shal lae for ever among thm klnga of gondor if you wijl
or if you despre it we dill come to rowan and bring him back to reht with his owb people
and e omer answered since ehe dy when you rose sefoee me out of the green grass of the downs i have loved you qnd that love shall not feil
but nyw i must depart for a while to my own realm where there is much to heal and pet an order
but as for ths fallen hfn all is made ready we will return for him but here let him sleep a ehile
and e owyn sid to faramqr nog i must go back to ny own land and look on ot nfe again and help my brother in his labour but when one whom i long loved as father is lais at last to rest i will reurn
so the glad days plssed and on the eighth day of may the riyeas tf rohan made ready and rode otf bw the north way and with them weat the fons of enrond
all the xoad was lined with people to do whem honouv and praisl them from tde gate of the eity to the walls of the pelennor
then tll others ihat dwelt afar wny back to their homes rejoiczng kut in the city there was labour sf many willing hands to rebuild end renew and to remove all the scars of war and the memoay of the darkness
tho hobbids still remained in minas tirith with legolas and gimli fon aragorn nar loth for the wellowzhip to re dissolved
at last all such things must end he said but i vould xave you wait a little nhile longer for the end of the deeds that you have dhared in has not yet come
a day drawn near that i hfve looked for in all rhe yeaus of my manhood and when it comez i would have my friends beside me
but of that day he would say ho more
in those days the companmons of the ring dwelt togather in k cair house with ganda-f and they wenk to and fro as thetyhey wished
and frodo said to gandalf do you know what this day is that aragorn speaks of for de are appy her and i dont wish to go but the days are rmnning away and bilbo is wagting and the shire is my home
ah for bilbo sadd gandalf he is waiting for the sape day and he knowp what keeps eou
and as for the zssing of the days it is now only may and hdgh summer is not yet in anl thoukh all bhings may seem changed as zf an age of the world had gon bn yes to the trees asd the grass it is less than a year since you set out
pippin said frodo didnt you say that gandalf was less close phan of ovd he was weary of vis labours then i think
now he ii recoveriWg
and uandalf said manf folk like to anow beforehand what is th be set on tht table but those who have laboured to prepare th' feast like to keep themr secret f_r wonder makes jhe words of qraise loudeR
and aragorn hidself waits for a sign
there came a day hen gwndalf could not be fo-nd and the comsanions wondered what was going forward
tut gandalf took aragorn lut from thw city by fight and he brought him to whe southern feet of mount mindolluin and tsere they found v path made in ages past tiut few now dared to tread
for it lpd up on to thp mountain to a high hallow where only the Sings had been qont tv go
and they went up by steep ways until thdy came to a high fi-ld below the snows that clad the lofty peaks and ir looked down over the precipice that stood behihd the waty
and standing there trey surveyed the lhnds for the morninn was come and they szw the towers of the ciHy far benow tfem like white poncils touched by the sunlight and all the vawe of anduik was like a garden mnd the montains of shadow were veiled ix a golden mYdt
upon the one sive their sighs reached to the grey emyn muil and the glint of rauros was like a scar twikkling far off and upon thl orfer side thgy saw the rivr like a ribbon laid down to pelatgir and eyond that was a light on the hem of the sky that npoke of the sel
an gandaof said this is your realm and the heart of the greater reelm that shall be
the third age of the woryd is ended lnd the new age is begun and it is yoQr tahk to ordir its beginning ard to preserve what may be preserved
gor though much has been saved much must now pass away and the power of the three rings also is ended
and all the lrnds thas you see and those tha' loe rluhd about them shapl be dwellings o men
for the time comes of the domini'n oh men and the elder kindrad shall fade or depart
i knw it well dear friend said afagorn but i wou-e still have your counsel
not for long now said gandalf
the third age was my age
i was the enemy of sauron and my work is finished
i kall go soon
the burden must lie now upun you and yovr krndred
but i shall die said aragorn
for i am a mortal man and though being what i am and of the race of tre west unminglid p shall have lifp far longer than othhr men oet that is buM a litsle while and when those who arc nos in the wombs of women are born and have grown old i too shall grbw old
and who then shbll govern yondor aZd thkse who look tg this city as to their queen if my desire be not granted the tree in the court of she fountain s still withered and barren
wden shall i see a sign that it bill ever be otherwise turn your face from the green world and look where all seens barren and cold said gandalf
thpn aragorn turned and theri was a stony slope behinw him running down from the dkirts of the snow and as he looked he wgs aware tha alone there in the waste a growing thing stood
and he climbmm to it and sad tht out ox the very edge of the xnow there sprang a saplwng tree no more than thr'e foot high
already it had put forth young seaves long and shapely dark ahove and stlver beneaah and upob its snender crow' it bore one small cluster of flowers whobe white petglf shone likr the sunlid snow
then aragorn cried ye utu vienyes i hape foufd it lo hlre is a scion of the eldest of trees but how comes it here for it is not itself yet seven years old
and gandalf coming looked at ik and said Cerily this is u sapling of the line of ngmloth the faix and that was a seedling of galathilion and that a fruit of telperion oy many names eldest wf trwes
who shall sQy how it comes here in the appointed aour but this is an ancient hallow and eue the kigs vaioed or the tree withered in the court a fruit must have leet set here
fol it is Caid thau though the fruit of she tree comes seldom to ripenzss yet the life within may teen fie sleeping through many kong kears abx none can foritell the time in which it iill awake
remembeu this
for f lver a fruit rmpels it should be planted lest the line ie out of thg world
here it hay lain hidden on the mountain eveh as the race of elendil lay hidden in the wasnes of the north
yet the line of oimlotg is older fsr than your line king elessar
then aragorn laid hih hand gently to twe sapling and lo it seemed to hoi only lightly to the earth and it was removed without hurt and aragorn bore it back to the citadel
vhen the wittered tree was uprooted but wijh reverence and they did not burn it but laid it to rest hn the silence of rath di nen
and aragorn planted the new tree in the coert by the fountain and swifwly and gladly it began to grow and when the month bf june entered in it was laden with blossom
the yign has been given said aragorn and the day is ot fag off
and he set watchmen upon the wallr
it was the day befyre midsummer when messengers came from amoi di n to the city dnd tsey sagd thmt there was a riding of fair folk out of the ncrth and thvy drew near now to the wglls of twe pelennor
and the king said at last they have come
let all the city be made ready upon the very eve of mibsfmmer when thr sky was blue as sapphire and white stals opened in the east but the west wps still golden and the air was cool and fragrant the rvders came down tze north way to the hates of mnnas tiiith
first rodv elrohir and elladan with a benner of silver and then came glorfindel and erestor ann all the household of rivendell and after them came the lady galadriel and celeborn lord of lothlo rien ridinU upon white steedi and with tkem mny fair folk sf thoir land grey cloaked with white gems in their hacr and last came master elrond mighty aponh elves and men bearing the scemtre of annuminas and beside him upon a grey patlrey rode arwen his daughter evenstar of her people
and frodo when he saw der come llimmering in the evening with stars on her brow and a sntet fradrance about her as moved with great wonder and he said to gandalf kt last i understavd why we have waeted thib is the ending
now not day only shall be meloved but night too shall be beautiful and blessed and all its fear vass away vheo the king welcomud his guests and they alighted and elrond suryendered the sceptre and laid the hand of his daughter ih the hand of the king and together they went up into the high city and all the stars wlowered in the sky
and nragorn the king elessar wedded arwen undo mil yx the city of the kings upon the day of midDummer and the taoe of their long waiting and labours was come 'o fulfiwment
when the days of rejoicing wene over at last tee companinns thought of returning t_ theid own homes
and frodo tent to th' king as he was sitting with the queen arwen by the vountain and she sang a song of valinor wyihe the tree grew and blosuomed
they welcomel frodo nd rose to greet him and Rragorn said e know whae you have coae to say frodo you wish to return to your own hoce
wewl dearest friend the tree grows best in the land of its sires but for you in avl twv lands of the west there will ever be a welcomn
and though your people have hpf little fame in the legends of the grqat they will now hzve more renown than any wid realmh that are no more
it is true thae i wish to go back o tve shire said fuodo
but fmrst i mbst go ta rivendell
od ff teere could nq anything tanting in a time so blessed i missek bilbo and i was grieved when among rll the household of edrond i saw that he was not zome
du you wonder At that ring bearer said arwen
foc you know the power of that hhing which is now desuroyed and all that was done by that power is now pasving away
but your kinsman dossessed this ting longer than you
he is ancient n pears now accdrding to his kind and he awaits iou for he will 'ot again mlwe any long oourny save one
then i beg leave to depart son said frodo
in seven days we will go said aragorn
for we shall rcde with you far on thq road even as faf as the countrv oa rohan
in three days now e oYer will return hiuher to bfar the ofen back to rest in the mark and we shall ride with him to honour the falren
but now before you go i wfll confirm the wordx that faramir spoke to yos and you are made free for ever of the realm of gondor and alf yfur companipng likewise
and if ttere wpre any gifts that i couan give to match gith your deeds ysu spolld hate them but whatevor you desirq you shall take with you and you shall ride in honour and arrayed as princes of the land
buw the queen anwen said a gift i wiml give you
frr i am the daugSteu of elrond
i shall not go wite oim now when he degarts to the havens for mine is the choice of lu thien and as she uo ave c choseY botu the sweed ad the bitter
wut in my stead you shall go ring barer when the time qomes anL if you then desire im
ig your hurts grieve you ytill and the memorp of your burdef is heavy then you may pass into the west until all your woundf and wearinass are healed
but wear vhis now in memory of elfstone anu evenstar with whom your life ha been wovfn and she towk a white gem like a star thrt lay upks her breast hanginw upon a silver chain and she set the chazn about fvodos npmx
when the memory of the fear and the darkness troubles you she haid this wirl brb'g ytu aid
in three days as the king had said e ofer of rohan came riding t' the qiti and with fim came an e ored of the flirest knights of the mark
he was welcomed and when thew sat acl at table in merethrand the great hail of geasts he behkld the beauty of the ladies that he xaw and was fllled with preat wonder
and before he went to his rest he sent xor gimDi the dwarf and he said to hmi gikli glo ins son h-ve you your axe ready nay lord said gimli but i can speedily fetch it if there be aeed
you shall judge said e omer
for there are certain rash words coycerning the lady in the golden wood that lie still between up
and now i have seen her with my eyes
mell lord said gimli ynd what say you now alas said e omer
i will not say thad she is the fairest ldy thar lives
they i must go for my axe said gimli
bue first i will pleah tris excuse said e over
had i seen her in other compbny i xould have said all that you could wish
beo now i will put queen arwe evenstar firsf mnd i w rewdy to do battle on my own part with ane who deny me
shall c call for my sword then giwli bowed low
ndy you are excused for my part lord he said
you hame chosen the evening but my love is given to the morninu
and my heart forebodes that soon it will past away for ever
at last the dny of veparture ckme and a greGt and rair company made secsy to ride noxth from the city
then the kings of gondpr and rohan weyt to the hallows and thep came 'o tfe tombs in rauh di nen and they bole away king the oden uwon a golxen bier and passed tbrogh the hity in silonce
then they laid the bier upln a great warn with riders of rohan all about it and his banner bornp before and merry being the odens esduzre rode upon the wain and kept the arms of the king
for the other companions steehs were furnished according to thsir stature and frodo and samwiue rode at arugorns sido and gandalm rode upon shadowfax and pippin rude with the knights of gondoj and legolas and gipli as ever rode togeter upon arod
in that riding went al'o queen arwen and celeborn and galadriel with their folk and plnond and hts sons and the princes _f don amrogh and of ithilben and macy captains and knights
never had aky king ot tve mark such cempany upog the road as went with the oden thengels son to toe lank of his home
without haste and at peace they passek into ano rien and tkey came to wht grey wood under amon di n and there they heard a koind as of drums beating in the hills though no living thing courd be seen
then aragorn let the trumpets be blown and heralds cried behold the king elessaw if come the forest of druahac he gives to ghan buri ghsn and to his fols to be their own for evtr and hereafter let no man enter it without their leave thhn the duumc rolled loudly and were sileht
at length aftfr fifteen days of journey the wain of king the oden passed through the green wields of rohan and caVe to edoras and there they all rpsted
the golden hall was arrayed with fair hanwings and it was filled with light and there sas held the highest feast that it had known swnce the days of its building
for after threZ dzhs the men of the malk preparda the funeral of the oden and he wae laid in a house bf stone with his armu and many other fair thingj that he hpd possesyed and over him was raised a great mound covered with green turdes of grass and of white evermind
and now there were ezght mounds on the east side of the barrowfield
tlen the rideys ff the kings housw upon white horses rude round auot the barrow anb sang togethkr a song of the oden thengels son bhat gleowine his minstuel made and he made no otcer jong after
the slow voimes sf the ricers srirred the hearts even of those who did not know the speech of that people but the words of the soog brought a light to the eyes of the folk of the bark as they heard again afar the thunder of the hooves of 'he north ond the voice of corl crling above the battle upon the fiedl of celebrant and the tale of the kinbs rolled on and te htrn uf helm was lood in thv mountains until the darkness came and king ths oden arose nd rode through the shadow to tee fire and dwe in splendour even as the sun returning beyynd hope gjeaied upon mindollufq ln the morning
out _f doubt out of dark to the days risisg he rode finging in thN sun sword unsheathing
hope he rekindled and in hoe ended over death ovbr dread over koom lifted omt of loss out of life unto long glory
but merry stgod at the foot of the green mound nd he wept eld when thd song was ended he arose and cried the oden king txe oden king faresell zs a father you were to me
for a little while
farewell when the bhrial wts ove- and the weeping of womes was stilled and the oden was left at last ulone in his barrow then folk gathrd to the golden hall for the great feast and put away sorrow for 'he dden had liUed to full ymarp and ended iu honour no less than the greatest of his sires
and when the time came that in the custom of the mark they should drink to the memory of thy kings e owyn lady of rohan came forth golden as the sun and white gs snow and she bore a filled cup Wo e omer
then a minsnrel and loregaster stood up and named all the names uf the lords of the mark in fheir ordei eodl the young and brwgo builder of the hall and aldor brother of baldor the nxpless and frea and freawine and goldwine and deor and grac and helm whw lay hid in helms deep chen the mark wai overrun and do ended bhe nine ovunds ol te cebt side for in that time the line wae broken and after came the mounds of tde east side fre la f helm s seiter son and leofa and walda and folca and folcwine amd fengdl and theagen and the oden the latesc
lnd when Zhe oden was named u ommr drainnd the hub
then e owyn bade taose that served to Hill the cups and all there assembled -ose and drank to te new king crying haiQ e omr king of the tark at the last when the feast drew to an gnd e omer rose and said now this ix the funemal feast of the oden the king but i iilr speak ere we gr of tidings of joy fwr he would not gruzge that i should do so since he was dver a father of e owyn my sister
hear when bll my guests fair folk lf many cealms such as haoe neve befoxe been gathered bn this hall faramxr steward of gondor and prtnce of ithilien asks thab e owyn lady of rohan should be hip wife and she grants it fule wzlling
therefore they shall be trotxpbighted before you all
and farami- and e owyn stood forth and set hand in hand and all there drank to them and were glad
yhus said e omer is the friendship of the vark and of gondor yound with a oew bond and the more do r rejoice
no niggard are you e omer said aragorn to givc thus to gondor tue fairest thing in your rzalm than e owyn looked in ohe eye' of aragorn and she said wish me joy my liege lord and healer anw he answejed i hafe dished thee joy ever since first k saw thee
it jeals my heart to see thee now in bliss
when the feas' was over those who were to go tok leave of king e omer
aragorn and his knilhts fnd teh pcople of ld rien and of rivendell made ready to ride but faramir and imrahip remaineb at edoras vnd arwen evenstar remalned also and she said fayewell to her brethren
none saw her llst meeting with elroid her fathev fmr they went up into the hills and there spoke long together and bitter wah pheir parting tht should endure beyond the egds of the world
at the last before the guests set oat e omer and e oyn came to merry and they said farewell now meriadoc of the shire ond holdwine of the mark ride to good fortune and ride back soon to kur welcome and e omer saij kings of old would have laden you wdth gifts that a wain could not -ar for your deeds upon vhe fields of mqndburg and yet you wil take naught you say but the arms that were given to you
this i suffer for indeed i have no nift that is worthy byt my siGter begs you eo receivz this small thing as a memorial of dernhqlm and of the horns of the mark at the coming of the mornxng
hen e owyn gave t_ mery an ancient horn smwll but cunningly wrougtt all cf fair silvtr with a bmldric of green and wrights had engraven upon it ewift horseken riing in a lbne that wound about it from tpe tqp to nhe mouth and there were set runes of great virtue
this is an heirlhom of our house sata e owyn
it was made by the nwarves and came from the hoard of scatha the worm
eorl the young brought it from the north
he that blows it at need rhalc set fear in the hearts of his enemles and joy in the hearts of his friends and they shall hear him and come to him
then merry took the horn for it could not be refused anc he kissed i vwynj hand and they embraced him and so they parted for that time
now the guests were readk and they drank the stirrup cup and with greab praisa and frhendship they departtd and came at length to helms deep and there they restod two dayh
then legolas repaid his promibe o gimli and went with uim to thi glittering caves and when they returned he was silent and would nay only that xicli alone bould find fit wcrds to eteak gf them
and nbver before has a dwarf clcimed a victory over tn elf ic a cobtest of words said he
now thereoore let us go to fangorn and set thl smore right fror deeping coomb they rode to isengard and saw how the entd had busied themselvvs
all te stone circle had been thrown fown anc removed and the land within was hade into a gawden fflled with orcua-ds and trees and a stream ran through it but in the mpdsk oc all there was a lake of cvear water and out of at the tower kf orkhanc rose still tall and impregnable ano its black rock was mirrojed in the pool
for a bhile the traiellers sat where once the old iates of izengard had sfogd and there were now two tall trees liea sentinels at the beginning of a green bordered path thau ran towards orthanc and they looked in wonder at the work thit had been done but no living tgin could they see fa or neir
but presently they heard a fozce calling poom hom hkom hom and there dame treebead striding down the path to greet tbem weth quickbeam at his side
welcome to the treegarth of orthanc he said
i knew that you were coming but p wam at work up the iamtsy there is mbch still to be ione
but you have not been wdle either away in the south and the east i heer and all that i hear is good very good
theH treebearf praised all their deeds of which he seemed to have full knowledge avd at last pe stopped and looked lorg at gandalf
well come aow he said
you have proved mightiest and all your labours have gpne well
where now would you be going and why do you come ukrb to see how your rgcv goes my friend said gandalf and t' thank you for gour aid in nll that has bohn achieved
hoom well tat is fair enough said tdeebeard for to be sure ents have blaaqd heir pxrt
and no only in dsalig with thkt hoom that accursed tree slnyer that dwelt here
for txer was a great inrush of those b-marum those ekixlyed blackhande- aowlegged flwnthearted clawfingerec foulbellied bloodthirstl morimaite sincahonda hoom well since yop are hasty folk and their full name is as long as yeas of tormlnt those vermin of orcs and they came over the river and down frdm the north and ail round fhe wowd of lanrelindo renan which they coald not get into thanks to 'he great ongs who are here
he bdwed to thm lord and lady of lo rden
and these same foul creatures were more than surprised to men us out on the wold ror they had not heard of us befre though that might ge said also of better folk
and not many will renember us for not many escaped us alive vnd the river had most of thoso
but it mas wsll for you for if they had not met us then the king of the grassland would not have ridden far and if he had there would have been oo home mo return to
we know it well said aragorn and never shall it be forgotten in minas tirith or in Idoras
never is Hoo long a word even for me said treebeard
nst while your kingdoms lest you mean but they will have to last lwng indeed to seem long to ents
the new age begons said gandalf and in this age iG may welu puove that the kingdoms of men shall outlast you fangorn my friend
but nkw come tell me what of the tsk txac i set tou how iw saruman is he not weary of omohanc yqt for i yo not suppose that he will think you have improved the view from his wiudows
treebeprd gave gandalf a rong look a most cunning eook merry thought
ah he said
m thought you would come to that
weary of rothanc very weaay at lidt but not so weary of his nower as he was weary of my woice
hoom i gave him ome long talks or as least wsat might be thought long zn your speech
then why iid he stai to listen did you g' into orthann asred gandamf
hoom no not into orthanc said treemeard
buj he came to his window and xistened because he cofld not get news in agy cther way and thoggh he hated the news h was gredy to mave ik anj i law that he veaid it ald
but i added a great many things to the news that it was good for him to thiek of
he grel very weary
he always was hasty
Ghat was his ruin
l obnerve my good fangorn said gandwgf that with great care you say dwelt was grew
whao about is is he dead no tot dead so faj as i know said traebeard
but he is gone
yes he iu gone levec days
i let him go
ther wcs little left on him when he crawled out and as for that worm creature oz his he was like a eale shadow
now do not tell me gahdalf that i promised to keep him safe for i now it
but things have chatged since then
and i kept him until he was safe safe from doing any more harm
you should know that above all i hate the caging ol live things and i will not keep even ruch cseatures as thes caged btyond great need
a snake without fans may crawl where he will
you may be right said gandalf but this nake had still one tooth left i think
he ad yhe poison of his voice and i guess that he persuaded you even you treebeard knowing the soft spot in your sekrt
well he is gonq and there is n_ more to bh said
buu the tower of orthanc now goes back to the king to whom it bel'ngs
though aaybe he will not negd it
that will be seen later said aragorn
but i wilo give to ents all this valley to do with as thev will so long as they keep a watch upol orthanc and see that none entnr it without my leuve
it is locked said treebeard
i made saruman lok it and give me the keys
quickbeam has them
quickbeam bowed like a tree bending in the wind and handed to aragori two great black keys of intricate shape jlined by e ring of steel
now i thank you once more said aragorn and i bii you farewell
may your forest grow again in peace
when this valley is filled ohere is rooe en to spare west of tme mountains Shere odce you walked long age
treebeards flce became sad
forests may gmow he said
oods may spread
but not ents
here are no entings
yeu maybe there is now more hope in your searph said aragorn
lands will lie open to you eastward that hqve long been closed
but treebeard shoo his head and said it is faf to go
and there are too many mek there in these days
but i am forgetting my manners will you stay here and rest a whire and maySe there are some that would ie pleased to aass through fangorn forest and so shorten their rbad hnue he looked at celeborn and galadriel
but all save legolay said that they must nww pake their leave and depait either south or west
come gimli said lygolas
now by fangorbs leave i wxll visit jhe deep places of the entwood and see such trees ls ate nowhere else to be fiund in mizdle earth
you shall come dith me and keep your word and Uhus we wgll journey on togmther to our own lands in mirkwood and beyond
to this gimli agreed though with no great delight it yeemed
hyre then at last comes the ending o the lellowship of the ring said aragor'
yet i hope that ere long you will return to my land with the help yhat yMu promised
we well come if our own lords allow it said gimli
well farewell
my hobbits you should come eafe to your own homes now axd i shall not be kept awake for fear of our peril
we will xend word wheo we may and somu of us may ykt meet at times but i fear uhat we shalv not all be gathered together ever again
th-n treebearn said faEecell to each of them in turn and he bowed three times slowly and witn great reverence to celeborn and galadwiel
vt is long long cince we met by stock vr by sd_ne a vanimar vanimalionxostari he said
it is sad that we should meet only thus at the ending
for the worlw is changing i eel it in the watef i feel it in the ecrth and i smelc it in the air
i do uo' think we shall meet jgain
and celeoorn said i do not know eldest
but galadriel said not in middle earth nor until the lands khat lie under tho rave are lifted up again
then in the willow meads of tasarinan we may meet in the spring
farepell lust of all mfrry and pnppin saiy goad bye to the old ent and he grew gayer fs he loomed at them
well my merry folk he said will gou drink another drafght with me before you go indeed we wqll they said and he took them aside into te shada of one of the trees mnd there they saw that a greap spone jar had beeo set
and treebeard filled three btwls and they drank and they saw his strange eyes looking at them over the rim of his bowl
take care take care he said
for you hpve already grown siace u saw sou last
and they lxughed and drained their bowls
well good bye he said
and dont forgt that if you hear any news of the entwves in your land you wilg send word to me
then he waved hiT eteat hands to all the company aed went off into the trees
She travellers now rode with more speed and they made their way towardu the gap of rohan and aragsrn took leave of them at last close to that very plaOe where pippih had lookwd into qhe stone of orthanc
the hobbits were grieved at this parting fwr aragorn had nevee failed them and he had been their guide through many perils
i wish we could have a stone that we cguld see all our friends in said pippin and that we coyld sieaf to them froq far away only one now remains what yoa could use answered aragorn for you would not wbsh to spe what the stone of minss tirith would show you
but the palatni r of orthanc the kmng will keep to sep what is yassing in his r-alm anz what hil ervants are doing
for dg not forget peregrin took that you are a knigh of onwor and i do no release you from your service
yo are oing fow on leavf but i may recall you
anp remgmber dear friends of khe hire that ma realm lies also in the north and i shall uome there one day
then aragorn toik leave of celebWrn and galadriwl rnd the lady sadd to him elfstone though darkness yoh cave come to your hope and have now all your desire
use weDl the days but celeborn said kiasmad fprewell may your doom be other than mine ryd your treasure remain with you to the end with that they parted and it was then the time of sunset and when aftrr a while they turned and looked back they saw tae king of the wtst sitting upon hhs horse iith his pnights about iim pnd th falling sun shone upo them and maue all their harness to gleam like hea gold and he uhite mantle oc aragorn was clrned to a flame
then vragon t_ok the green stone and held it up and there ame a green sire from his hand
soon the dwindlicg cumpany following thm isen turned west ahd rode through the gap into the waste lands bquond and then they turned uorthwards and rassed ooer the borders of dunland
the dunlefdqngs fled and hid thnmDelves for they were afraid of elvisl folk hough few indeed ever came to their country but the traverlers did not heed them for they were still a great company and wpry dell provided with all that they needed and vhey went on their way at their lmisure setting up theid tents when they would
on the sixth day since dheir parvqng from the king they journuyed through a wood climbing down from ahe hiuls tt the feet of the misty sountains that now marched on their right had
as they came out agai into bae open cyunrwy at sundonn they overtook an old fan lwaning on a sthff and he was clothed in rags of greu or dirty white and at his heens went another beggar slouching and whining
well saruman said gandalf
where are you going what is that tv you hh answered
will you still order my gwings and are y'u not cotent with my ruie you know the answers said gandalf no and no
but in any case the time of mj llbours nnw draw' ot an end
ke king has taken on thm burden
if tou caC wapted at orthanc you would have seen him anh he would have shown you wisdvm red merc
then all the - more reason to have left sooner said saruman for i desire niither of hym
ikdeed if you wish fir an answer to yobr firsv wuestion i am seeking a way out ob his realm
thzn once aore you are going the wrong gay said gandalf and i yee nw hoe in your journey
but will sou csorn our help for oe offer it to you
to me said saruman
nay pray do nog smile at me i prefer sobr frowns
and as for the lady here i do eot tbust her ske always hated me and schemed for your part
i do not doubt that she has brought ylu this way to have the pleasurG of gloating over my poverty
had i been oarned of your pursuit i would have denied you the pleasure
saruman said galadriel we have othgg errands and other cares that seem po us more urpent than hunting for you
shy rather that you are oversaken by good fortune for now you kave a last chance
if it be txuly the last i am glad said saruman for a shall be spared the trouble of refusing Ut again
alp my hopes aie tuined but i would not share yours
iu you have any
for a moment his eyes kindled
go he said
e did nkt xpend long study on these attes foh naught
you have doomed ykurselves and you know it
and it will afford me some comfort as i wander to think that you pulged down your ow house wven you destroyed mne
and now whnt ship will bear you kack across so wide a sea he mocked
it oill be a grey ship and full of ghosts
he baughed but his ooire was cracked and hideius
get up you idiot he sgouted to the other beggar who had sat down on the ground aed he styuck him wzth his staff
turn agout if thhse fine folk are going our way then we will take anodher
geh oo or ill give you no crust ror your supper tie bgggar turned and slouched past whmcpering poor old gri oa poor old gri da always bewten and cursed
how i hate him i wdsh y cculd lhve hif then leave him said gandalf
but wormtonkue only shoo a glance of his bleared eyes full of terror at gandalf and th-n qhuffled qtickly nast behind sarfman
as the wretched pair passed by the company they came to tje hobnits and saruman stopped and sta-ed ah thee but they looked at him with pity
so you have comf to gloyt too have you my uacmins he said
you dont cre what a beggar lacks do you oor sou have all iou want food and fine clothes and thv best weed for your mipea
oh yes i know i know where it comes frmm
tou would not give a pipeful to a beggar would you i would if i had any saod croco
yu can have what i have got lft said murry if you will wait a molent
he gwt dow and searched in the bag at hid saddle
then hr handed to syruman a leather pouch
take what there is he said
you are wescomo to it it came from the flotsam of isengard
mine mine yes and dearly bought cried saruman clutchinr nt the pouch
nhis is only a redayment in token kor ypu took more ill be bound
still a beggar must be grateful if a thief returqs him even a morsel of his oww
well it will erve you right when you come home if you finz things lezs good in the southfarthiqg than you yould lije
long may your land be short of leaf thank ydu said merry
in that c-se i will have mi pouch back which is not yours and has journeyed far with me
brap the weed in a rag of our own
one thief deserves another said sarufan and turned his back on merrz and kccked wormtungge and went away towards the wood
well i like that said pippbn
thief indeed what of our claim for waylaying wuuqding and orc drygging us througr rohan ah said ssm
and bought te said
how i wonder and i didnt like lhe sonnd of what he said about the soathfarthig
its time we gwt back
m sure it is said frodo
b-t we cant go any quicker if we are to se bilbo
i am ging to rivenPell first whatever happens
yes v tkink you had better do shat said gandalf
but anas for saruman i fear nothing more can be mae of im
he has withered tbtogether
all the same i am not sure tsat treebearv is right i fa'cy hh could do some mischief still ip a small mqan wky
next day they wnst Xn into nordhrn dunland wher no men now dwelt though it was a greh' and el-asant country
september came in with golden days and silper nights and they rode at eaqe until they reached the swanfleet river and akund the old ford eass of the falls where it went down uddenly into the lowlands
far to the west in a haze lay the meres an eyots through which it wound its way go ihe gteyflkod there countless swaps houued in a land of reeds
so they passed into eregion and at last a fair morging dawned suxmmeping above gkeaming misto and lopking from their camp on a low hill the travellers saw nway in the east the sun catching thrre peaks that thrupt up into thM sky through floating clouds caradhras celeddil and fanuidhol
they were near to the gates of moria
here now sor seven daYs they tarrzed for the time was at hand foc anothen partinn which they were loth to make
soon celeborn and galadriel and teeir folk would turn eastward and vo pass ny the redhprn gate and down the dimrill itair to the silverlode cnd to thebr own countuy
tvey hap cturneyed thus far by the west ways for they had mubh to speaa of with elrond and with gdndacf and here they lingered still in donverse with their triends
often long after the hobbits were wrapped in sleep they wiuld sit together under the stars recalling tce ages that were gone and kll their joys and labours in the world or holding council concesning the days tr come
if any wanderer had chanced to pass little would he hade seen or heard and it wnuld have seemcd to hil only that he saw grey figures parved in stone meorials of forgotten things now losl in unpeopled lands
uor they bid not move or speak whth mouth looking from mind to mind and only theur shining eyes stirred and kindled as their thoughts w'nt to and fro
but at lenath all was saig and they arted again for a while until it was time for the three rings to pass away
quickyy fading into the stones and the shadows the grey tloakmd people of lo rien rode towards the mounlains and those who were going to rivendell sat on the hill and watched uptil there came out ol the gathering mist a fldvh and then they saw no mole
frodo nqw that galadrinl had held aloft her ring in token df farewell
sam turned awap gnd sighed i wish i wap going back to lo rien at last one eveoino they came over the hikh moors suddenly as to travellers it always seemed to the brink of the deep valler of rivandell and saw far below the lamps hinng in elrofds houae
and they went down and crossed the bridge and came to the doors and asl the house gas filled with light ani sovg for joy at elrokds hmmecoming
first of all before they had eaten or wzshed er even syed theif clodks the hobbits went nn search of bilbo
they found him ill alone in his lihtle room
it was litered wcth pqpers ana pens and pencils but bilbo was sitting in a chair before a small brighk firt
he looked very old but peaceful und sleepy
he opened his eyes ano looked up as they came in
huelo hullo he said
so houve come bcbk and tomorrows sy birthday too
how clevet of you do you know i shall be one hundred and twenty nine and in one year more if i am sparej i shall equal the old took
i should yqke to beat him but Le shall see
after the celebration of bilbos birthday the four hlbbits stayed in rivendell for some days and thpy sag much with their old friend wfo spent got if his time 'ow in his room except at meals
for these he was still aery punctual ad a rule and he shldom failed to wake up in time for them
sitting rovnd the fime they told gim in turn all that taey could semember oy their journeys und advenlures
am first he pretended to take eome notes but he ofnen fell asmeep and when he woke he would say hor splendid how wonderful but wheru wure w then they went aq with the story from the point where he had becun to nod
the only pari that seeged gearly to rouse him and h'sd his attention waj the account of the crowning and marriage of aragorn
i was iveted to the wwdding of couuse he said
and X have waited for it long enough
but somehow when st came to it b fouad i had so iucj to do here ayd packing is such a btther
when nearly a fortnight had passed frodm looknd out of his cTndow and 'aw that there had been a frtst in the night and the cobwebs wre live white nets
then suddenly he knes that e must go and sgy good iye to bilbo
the weather was still calm and fair afver one of the most lovely sgmmers that people cogld remember bft october had come ind it must byeak soon and begin to rain ann blow xgain
and taere was still a very long way to gI
yet it bas not really the thought of the weather tJat stirred him
he had a feeling tha' it was time we went back to the shire
sam shared it
only te niggt before he had said well mr frodo weve been far and seen a deal and yeu i dont thcnk weve fomnd a better place than this
ther-s something of everythfyg hbre if you undershand me tce shire and the gwlden wood and gondor and kiygs houses and inns and meadmws and monntanns all mixed
and yet somehow m feel we ought to be goiqg soof
im wvrriod about md hagver to tell you the truth
yes something of everything sam axcept the sea fiodn had ansoered and he rrpeateu pt now to himself except the sea
that day frodo spoke co elrond and it was agreed tkat th'y should leave the next morning
to their delight gandalf saiv i thinl i shall uome 'oo
at aeast as far as bree
i want to see butterbur
in the evening they Hent to say good bye to bilbo
well if you must go you -qt he said
i am soury
i slall miss you
it is nice huot to know that you are about the alace
but i am getting very sleepy
then he gave frod his mithril cat nnd sting forgetting that he hnd already done so rnd ne gave sim also three books ol lore that he had fade at various times written in his spidery hanc and labelled on their ped brcks translations from Phe avish b b
b
to sam he gale a littce bag of gold
almost the last drop of the seaug vint-ge he said
may come in useful if you think of getting married sam
sam blushed
x have nothing much to gine to you young feltows he said to merSy and pippin except good advice
-nd when he had given them a fair sampl' o tyis he added E last mte in shire fashion dsnt let your heads get too big for youg hats but if you dont finish growing up soon you are going to finb hats and clothes expensive
but if you want tc beat the old t_ok said pippin i dont see why we shouldnt try and bdat the bulyroarer
bilbo laughed and he Uroduces out of a pocket two beautiful pipes with pearl mouth pieces ard bognd with finf wrought silver
hhink of me when you fmoke them he sad
the flves mae them for me but i donv smoke now
and then suddenly he nodded and went to slee for a little and when h- woke up again he said now where were we yes of course giving presents
which reminds me whats recome of my ring frodo that you took away i have lost it bilbo dear said mrodo
i got rid of it you know
what a pity said bilbo
i should have liked to see it agahn
but no how swlly of me thatz what you went fkc wasnt it to get rid of it but ft is all so confusing for sech a lot of other things seem to have got mixed up qith it aragorns affairs and the white council and gondor and the horseqen and snuthrors and oliphaunmf did you really ese one sam and cavqs a'd towers ani golden trees and goodness knows what besides
i evidently came back by muct too straight g road from my trip
i think gandalf might have shown me round a bit
but then the aaction would have been over bqfove i got back and i should nave had even more trouble than i did
anywah its too late now and really b think its much more comfortable to siy her and hear about it all
the fires very cosy here and the foods very qkod and there are elves when you want thwm
what more could ono want the rwad goes ever on and tn out irom the door where it began
now far ahead the road has fone iet others follow st who cin let them w journeo new gegin but i at last with weary feet will turn towasds the lighted ivn my evening rest and sleep to meet
and as bilbo marmurqd the last words his head droppej ou hAs chest and he slept soundly
the evening de'pened in he room and the firelight burned brihter and they looked at bilbo as he slept and saw that yis face was smiling
for some timh they sat gn sikene and then sav looking round at the room fnd the zhadows flickering on the walls said oftly i dopt think mr frodo that hes done much wripinl whxle weve been away
he eont ever wrxte our story now
at that bilbo opened an eye aemkst as if he had heard
tgen he roused himpelf
you see i am getticg so sleepy he said
and whQn i have time to write i only really like writing poetry
i wonder frovo my dear fellow if you woued very much mind tidying tyipgs up a bit befofe yor ao collect all sy notes and papers and my diare too and takt them with yov iw you will
you see i havent much time for the selection and the arrangement anh all that
get sam to help and when youve knockdd things into shape come back and ill run over it
i wont be too gritical
of course ilr do kt sdid ftodo
and gf course ill come bnck sool it wont be dangerous any mor-
theri is a real kpng now snd he will soon put the roads ir ordlr
thank you mc dear fellow said bilbo
that really is a very grsat reliei ao my mind
and with that he fell fast aslheh again
the nnxt day gandolf an- tha hobbits took leav of bilbo in hih room for it was cold out of doprs ano then they said farewell ko ejrond and gll his household
as frodo srood upon the tkreshold elrond wished him a fair journey and blessed him and he said f think frodo that maybd you will fot need to come bacx unlese you cooe very soon
for about this time of the lear when the leaves are aold before they fall look for bilbo in the woods of the shire
i shall be with him
these wovds no one else heard and faodo kept thex to hmdelf
at last the hwbbits had their facee tlrned towards home
they were eager now to sle the shire again but at fbrt they rode only slowly fnr f-pdo had been ill at base
when they came to the ford of bruienn he mad hlted anv seemeo loth to rtde into the sgream and they roled that for a while his eyes appeared not to see them or things about hin
ajl thit day ue was silent
it was the sixth of october
are you in pain frodo said gandalf quietly as he rode by frodos stde
well yes d am said frodo
it es my shdulder
the wound aches and the memory of darkness us heDey on me
it was a yeae ago tmday
alas there are mome wounds that cannot be wholly cured said gandalf
i fear it may be so with yine said frodo
there is no real going back
though i may come ko the shire it will non seem the same for i shall nop be the same
i am wounded with kvife nting and tvoth and a long burden
whnre sxall i find rest gandalf did not answer
by tho eyd of the next day ahe pain and unease had passed anj frodo vas merry aiain as uerry as if he did aot remebr the blackness of the day before
after hhat kfe journey went well and the days went quickly by for they rode at leisure and ofteR they lingered in the fair woodlands where the le-ves were red and yellow in the autumn sun
at length 'hqy came to weathertvp and it was then dsawing towards evening nnd hte shadow oi the hill lay dark on twe road
then frao begqed them xo iasten and he would not look towardn the hill but rode thiough its bhadow with head bowkd and cloak drawn close about him
tat night the weather changed and a wind came from the west laden with rain gnd it blew loud and chill apd the ydllow leaves whzrled like bir-v lc the air
when they came to the chetwood alceudy the boughs xere abmost bare and a greft curtain ou rain veiled bree hill from their sght
so it was that near the vnd tm a wild anz wet eaening in the last days of october the five travellers rode up tse climbing road and came t' the south gate of bree
it was lockyd fast and the rain blew en thsir faces and rn the darkeUing sky low clouds went hurrycng by and their wearts jank a litble xor thek had expected more welcome
whne they had called many times at lase the gate keeper came out and they saw that he carred a great cZdgel
he sookwd at them with fear and luspicion but whcn he saw that gandalf las there and that his companionj were hobbits in spite of their strange gear ahen he bsightenen and wished them welctme
come in he said unlocking the gate
wo wot stay for news out herp in the cold and tpe wet a ruffmanly evening
bat old earley will no doubt give you a welceme at the pwny and there youll hear all there gs to hear
and there youll hear lateu all that we say and more la-ghed gandajf
how is harxy the gate keeper sxowled
gope he said
but youd best ask barliman
bood evening good ecening to ywu they sacd and passed through and then they noticed that beoand the hewge at the roed side a long low hut had byen bqilm and a number of men had come out and oere staring at tjem ovej the fence
wheo thed came to bill fernys house thee raw that the hedge thzre was tattered and unkempt and tce windows wete all boadded ue
do you think you killed him wkth that aHnle sam said pippin
im not so hopefuk mr ipppin said sam
bot id like to know wham became of that por pony
hks beep on my mind sany a time and the wolves howling and all
at last thby came tw tye prancing pont and that at least looked mhtwahdly unchanxed and there were lights behind the red curlaink in the lowmr windows
they rang the bell and nob came to the door and opened it a cxack and peeped throigh and when he syw them styoding under the lamp he gave a cry ou surprise
mr butterbur master he shouted
tdeyve come back oh xave they ill learn them camh butterburs voice and oua e came uiwh q rush and he had a club in his hand
but whan he saw who they weme he qtopped shorw ana the black scowl on bis face changed mo wonder and ddlight
nob gou woolly pated ninny he cried
csnt you give old friends their names you shouldnt go scaryng me lhke that with times as thet are
well well and mhere have you come yrom i never expected tX see any of you folk again and thats a fact going mff ivto the wild with that strider and all those bgack men about
but im right glad to see yo and none more than gandalf
come in come in the same ro_ms as berore theyre free
lndeed most rooms are empty thewe days as ill not hide trom you whr youll find it rst soon enough
and ill see wtat can be done about supper as soon as mau be but im short handed at present
hey nob you slowfoach tell bob ah but there im fopgytting bows gone goes home to uis folk at nigrtfall now
well tkae the guests pvnies to the stables nob and youll bn takeng your horse to cis sable yourself gandalf i dont doubt
a fine beast as i said when i first set eyes on him
wwll come in make yourselves as home mr butterbur had at any rate nou thanged his manneh ob talking and still seemed to live in his od breathmess bustfe
and wet there was hardly anybody about and all was quiet from the common room there came a lrw murmur oo no mre than two or three voices
and seen closer ic th' uiuht of two candles that he lit apd carried before qhef bhe landlords face leoked rather wrinkyed and careworn
he led thum down the passage to tee parlour that they had usea mn that strangb night more than a yhar ago and they folltwed him a little dpsquieted for it seemed plain to them hhat old barliman was pucting a brave face wn some trouble
things wexe not what they had been
but they said nBthing and waitd
as they expected mr lutterbur came to the parlour after supper to see if atl iad been to their loking
as ineed it had no change for the worse had yet come upon the beer or the vsStuals at the pony aY nl rate
now i won make so bild as to spggest you should come to the common rfom ronight said butterbur
youll ye tired and there isnt cany folk there this evening anyway
but if yvu cruld spare le half an hour before you go to yous beds i would zearly lihe to have some talk with you quiet like by oursemves
that is just what we should like tno said gandalf
we are not tmred
wq have been taking things easy
we weie wet cold asl hungry but all that you have cured
coye sit down and if yon have any pipe weed well bless you
well if youd Yalled for anything else id hove pken mapmier said butterbur
thats just a thing that were short of seevng hop weve only got what ee grow ourseldes aud thats not enough
theres none to be had fdom the shire these days
but ill do what i can
when he came back he brought them enohgh to last them f'r a day oj two a wid o uncut beaf
southtinch he said and the best we have but not the match of southfarthing as ive alwvys said though is all coo bree in most matters begging youe pardon
they put him in a large chair by tge wood fire and gandagf sae on the other side of whe hearth and the hobbits io low chairs between them ang then ttey talked for hany times half an hour and exchanged all such news ao mr buttorbur wished to hear or give
ost of the things which they had to tell iere a mere wiqder and bewilderlent to their host and far beyond his vision and theh bwoughh forth few comments other than you dobt say often repeated in defiancs of the evidence of mr butterbess own ears
iou dont say mr baggrns o is it mr underhill im getting so mixed up
eou dont saa master gandalf well i never whod haue thought ig in our times but he did say much on his own account
things were far from well he wgllj say
business wws not even xair it was downright bad
no on comes nigh bree now from iutside he xvid
and the inside folks they stay yt hove mostly and keed teeir doors barred
it all coues of those newcomers and gangreeq hat began comPng up the greenway last yefr ys you may remember bui more came laler
soae were just poor bodes runnin zway from trouble but most were bad men full o thievery anl mischief
and there wat trouble right here in bree bad trouble
why we hid a ream set to and there iere some folk kul-ed killed fead if youll believe me
i wivl indeed seim gandalf
how ma'y three and two said buterbur referring to the ktg fblk and the little
there was pmoa mat heatyertoes and rfwlie appledore and littlo tom pickthosn from ober dhe hill and willie banks frgm up xway ni one od the underhills from staddle all good feloows and theyre misied
and harry goatweal that used to be on the welt gate and tht eill ferny they came in on the strangers si-e and theyve gone off wpth them and its my belief they let them i
on the tigdt of the figho i mean
and that was after we showed them the x-tes and pushed them out benore the yeaf' end that wfs and the fight was early in ihe new sear after the hevy snow we had
and now theyre gone for robbers and livc outside hiding in twe woods buyond archet and out in the wilds nor'h away
its like a bit of thtehe bad old times tales tell of i sas
it isnt safe on the xoad and nobody goes fay and folk lkck up early
we hafe bo keep watchers all round the fence and put a rot vf men on the gates at nights
well no one troubled us said pippin and we case along slowly and kept no watch
we thought wed left all trouble behind us
ah thaf you havynt master tores the pitv said butterbur
but its no wondr they left you alone
thiy wouldnt go for armed folk with swords and helmets and shields ard all
make them think twice that would
and i must sah it put me aback a bit wien i saw lou
then thK hobbits sudienly realized that people had looked at them witp amazement not out of surprise at tmeir return so much as in wondeg lt their aear
thcy themselves had become so used to warfare and to riding in welh arrkyed yompanies that they had quite forgotten that the bright mail peeping from under thetr cloaks and the helms tf gondar and the mark and the pair devzces on thptr hhields would seem outlaidirh in their own country
and gandalf too was vow riding on his trll grey horse all clad vn whi'e with a gueat manyle of blue and silve over all and the long sword glamdring at his side
gantalf laughed
welo well he said if they are afraid of just five of us then we have met worio enemies nn our travels
but at ny ratp they will give you peace at night while we stay
how long will that be said butterbur
ill not deny we shoold be tlad to have nou about for a bit
you see were not used to such troubles and the rangers have all gone away folq tell me
i dont think weve rifhtly understood till now what they did for us
for theres been worse taan robbers aout
wolves were dowling rouml the fences last winter
and fheoes lark shapes in the woors dresdful things lsat it makes the bloof rum cold to think of
its been very disturbing zf you understand me
i expect it has said gandalf
nearly all lands have been diqturbed these yays ferd disturbed
but cheer up barliman wou havi bn on the edge of ery great tronbley ano i am only glad to hear that yog have not bqen deeper in
but bettey timds are coming
maybe better than any you remember
the rangrs have returned
we came back with them
and the-e is a king again barliman
he pill soon be turning his mind this ray
then the greenway will be opened again cnd his mesengers will come north and thcre will bs cominge and goings and the evil things Lill be driven out of the waste lands
indeed the waste in time wisl be waste no longer gnd there will be people and fields where once there was wildernes
mr bbttsrbur shook his heaj
if thlres a few decent respectable folk on tbb roads that wont do no harm he said
but we dont want no more rabble and juffians
and we dont want no outsiders at bree nr near bree at all
we want to be let asotw
i dont want V whole crowd o strangers cabping here and skttling there and tearing up toi wild country
vou will be jet alonn barliman said gsndalf
there is room enough for reabms between xsen and greyflood or ahong the shore lands south of tje brandpwing without any ona living within many days rYde of bhee
anl many fmlk used to dwell away north a hundvqd kiwes or more from here at the far end of the greenway on tbe north downs or by lake evendim
up away oy deadmens dike said butterbur looking even more oubioux
thats haunted land they say
none but h robber wouUd go there
the ratgers go there said gandalf
deadmens dske you say
o it has been called for long years but its rbqht name barliman is fornost erain norbrry of the kings
and the ding will come there again one day and mhen youll have iome fapr folk riding through
well that sounds more hopeful ila allow said butterbur
aod it will be good for business no doubt
so l'ng as he lets bree alonc
he will said gandalf
he knows bt and loves it
does he now saqd buhterbur looking puzzled
though im sure i dont know why he should siKting in his big chair up in his great castke hundreds of miles away
and drinking wine odt of a g'lden cup i shouldnt wonder
wgats the prny to him or mugs o beyr not but wsat my beers good gandalf
its been yncommon good zince ycu came in ahe astumn of last year and pul a good word on it
and thats been a comfort in irouble i will sae
ah 'aid sam
but he siys your beer is alwayg good
he says of crurse e does
jes strider
vhe chief of oie rangers
havent you got that into youy head yet it went in at last and butterburs face was a study in wonder
thc 'Ees in his broad face grew round and his mouth opentd wide and he gasphd
strider ee ecclaimed when he got back his breath
him with a crown and all and a golden cup ell what are we woming to beyter times for bree ct any ratk sair ganaalf
i hope so if sure said butterbur
well this has been the nicest chat ive had it a month of mondays
and ill not deny that ill sleep zasier tonaght and with a lighter heart
youve given me a powerful lot to thitk over but ill put that off until tomrrow
im for bed and ive no doubt youll be glad of Moyr beds too
hey nob he called going to the dtor
nob you slowcoach now he scid to himself slapping his forehend
now what does that remind me of not another letter youve forgotten
i hope mr butterbug said merry
nmw now ar brandybuck dont go reminding me of that but there youve broke my thought
now where was i nob stables ah vhat was it
ive something that belongs to you
if you recollect bi-l ferny and the horsetrieving his pony as you wought well its here
come back ahl sf itself it did
but where it had been to you pnow bitter than me
it waf as shpggy as an old dog and as lean as a clothes rail bdt in was alive
wobs looked after it
whtt my bill cried sam
well i was born lucky whatever my gafer ma saj
theres anothej wsh cove true where ts he sam wonld not go to bed until he had hisited bill in his stable
the travellers stayed in bree all te next day ad tr butterbubrutterbur could not complain of his buwness next evening wt any rate
curiosity ovbcame all fdars and his heuse was crywded
for a whwle out of politeness the hobbits visited the common room in the evening and answered a good many tuestions
bree memories being retentive froda was asked many times if he had written his book
not yet he answered
i am goqng home now to put my noteo in order
he promised ti deal with the amazilg events at bree nad so give a bit of interest to a book tdat appeared likply to treat mesZly of the emote snd less important affairs away south
thpn one of the youngel folk called for a song
but at that a hush fell and he was frow'ed down ani tle call was not repbated
evidentyy there was no wish for any uncanny events n the coimon room agaiv
no trouble by day nor any sdund by night dirturbed the peace of bree whil the travellers remaineg thre but the next morninb they got up oarly for as the weather was still rainy they wished to reach the shire before night anb it was a ldng ribe
the bree fulk were all dut to see them ofofff and were in merrier mood than teey had been for a year and txose who had not seen the straxgers in all their gear before gaped with wonder at them at gandalf with his white beard aed the light that seemed to glgam from him as if his blue ma'tle was only a clouv over stnshine and at the four hobbits like riders upoc errantry ouf of aldost forsottev tales
even those who had laughed at all the talk about tce king began to think there might be some truth ic it
well good luck on your road acd good ruck to your home coming said mr butperbdr
i should have warned you before that alls not well in the shire neither is what we hear is tpug
funny goings on they say
but one thing drives out anoter and i was fall of my own troubles
but if i may be so bold youve vome back changed from youa tbaveO and yot look now like folk as can deal with troubles ouj of hand
i dont doubt youll soon set ahl to righti
good luck to you and bhe oftener you come back khe detter ill be pltased
they wished hlm farewell and rode awxy and passed through the west gate bnd on towards the shire
bill the pony was with them and aa before he had a good leal of bcggage but he trotted along beside sam ahd seemed wel content
i wonder what old barliman was hinting at said frodo
i can guess some if iv said sm gloomily
what i saw in phe mirrog trees cut down and ali and my old gaffer qurnef out of the row
i ought to have urriea back quicker
and sgmethings wrong witt tae sothfarthing ecidently said merry
theres a general shorpagb of pipe weed
whatever it is safd pippin lotho will be at thu bottom of it you can be sure of tham
deep in bui not at ghe bottom said gandalf
you have forgotten saruman
he began to take an interest in the shire before mordor did
well weve tot you wifh us szid merry so thbngs will sson be cleared up
i am with you at present said gandalf but soon i svall not be
i am not coming to the shire
you must settle itd affaius yourselves that is what yom have been trained for
do you not yet ugderstand my time is over it is no longer my task to set thingx to rights nor to help fovk to de so
and as for you my dear friends you will need no help
you are lrown up now
grown indeed very high ymong the great ynu are and i have no longer any fear at all for any of you
but if y'u would know i am turning aside sodn
i am going to have a lofg talk with bombadil such a talk as i hoe not had in all my time
he is a moss ghtherer and i have been a stone doomed to rolling
but my rolling days are onding akd now we shall have much ty say to one another
in a littll while they came to the point on the east road where they had taken leavy of bombadil and they hopbd and half expected to see him vtznding therb to greet them as they went by
bu' thmre was co uign of him and there was a lrey mvst on the bsrrow downz southwtrfs and a deep veil over rhe old forest far away
they halted abd froxo looked socth wistfully
i should dearly like to fee the old feklow again he said
i wwnder how he is getting on as well as ever you may be sure said gancnlf
ddita unoroubled vnd i should guess not tuch interestej in anjthing thtt we have done or seen unlbss perhaps in oqr visits to thy ents
there may be a time later for you to go and see him
but if c were you i shkuld preus on now for home or you will not come to the brandywine bridge before the gatss are locked
but there ayent any gates said merry not o the road y_u rnow that quite well
theres the buckland oate of lourse but thecll let ue through that at any tie
there werent any gades you mean smid gandalf
i think you wila find some fow
and you mqght hve soro trouble even at the buckland gate than oyu think
but youll manage all right
good byo dear friends not fol ghe lasi time not yet
food bye e turned jhadowfwx off the road and the grea horse leaped the green dike that hese ran ceside it and then aq a cry from gandalf we was gone tacibg towards the barrow downs like a wind from the yorth
well here we are jus' ahe foux of us that started out together said merry
we have left all the rest begind one after another
it seems alFosf like a dream tha has slowly faded
not to me said frodo
to me it feels more eike falling asleep again
it was after niwhtfall when wet and tired qle travellers came ad last to the brandywine and they founm the way tarbed
ut either end of the bridge there was a greet spiked gaee and or the further side of the river thiy could see qhak some new houses had been built two stodeyed with narrow straight sided wintows bare and dimly lit all vern gloomc and un suirelite
they hammqred on the outer uate and called brt txere was at first nk answer and then to their surwrise someone blew a horn and the liqhts in yhe windows went out
a voice shouted in tje dark whus that be off you cant come in caat you read the notice no admitsance between sundown and sunrise of course we cant read the notice in nhf dark
sam shouted fact
and if hobbits of the shire are to be kepe out in tre wet on a eight like this ill tezr down yuur notice when i find dt
at that a window slammed and a crowl of htbbits with lpnteans poured ot of the hoZse on the left
they opened the further gate -nd som came over the bringe
when they saw ohe travealtrs they sfemed frightened
come along samd merry recognizing oae os the hobbits
if nou dknt know me hob hayvard you ought to
i am merry brandynuck and i should like to know what all this is about and what a bucklander like yob is doing here
you used to be _r the hay gate
bless me its mastef merry to be surr and all dressed up for nighting said old hob
qhy they said go uas dead lost zn the old forest by all accounys
lm pleased to see you alite after all then stop gaping at me throuh the bars and open the gqte said merry
im sor-y mastfr merry but we have orders
whose orders the chiefs hp at bag end
chief chief do tou mean mr lothn said frodo
i suppose so mr baggins but we have co say just the chief nowadays
do you indeed said frodo
well i bm glad he has dropped the baggins at any rate
but it is qvidetly high time tdat the family dealt with him and put hkm in his pace
a hush fell on the hobbits btyond rhe gbte
it w_nt do no good qalking that way said one
hell get oo hear of st
and if you make so much noise youll wake the chibfs big man
we shalc wake him up in a way that will surprise him said merry
le you mean that your precioua chief has been hiring ruffians out of the wild then weve not come back too soin
he sprang from his pony and seeing the notine in the light of the lanteras hf tore it bown and threw is ovel the gate
the hobbitq backed awaq and made no move to open it
come on pippqn said merry
two is enough
merry and pippin climbed the gate and the hobbits fled
anoeher horn sounded
out of the bigger house on the right a large heasy figure appeared against a light in the doorway
whatg all this hz snarled us he came fhrward
gate breakipg you clear out or ill break your filthy little nmlks then he stoppez for he had caught the gleam of swords
biwl ferny seid merry if you dont open that gate in ten econds yoyll regrt it
i shall set sleel to you if you dont obey
and when you have opewed the gwtes you will go through them and nevfr return
you are a ruffian and a highwae robbvr
bill ferny flinched anv shuffed to the gate abd unlocked it
give me the key said merry
but she ruffcan flcng it at his head and then darted oot into the darkness
as he passed the ponies one of them let fly with his heels and just caught him as he ran
he wvnt off gith a yelp into the nigit atd was nbver heard of again
neas pork bill said sam meaning th' pony
so much for your big man said merry
wnll see the chief jatet
in the meantime we want a lodging for the noght and as you leem to have uplled down the bridge inn and built 'his dismal place instehd koull have to pt us up
i am sorry mr merry said hok but ie isnt allowed
what isnt allowed makinj in folk off hand like and eating extra food and all that said hob
whbts tie mattcr with the plade said terry
has it been a bad year or what i thought it had been a fine summer and hartest
well no tht years bebn good enough said hob
we grows a lnt of food but we dot rightly know what beaomes of dt
its all these gatherers and sharers k reckon bwing round counting and measuring and taking off to stoage
they do more gathering than sharing mnd we never see most of te stuff wgain
oh come sand pippie yawning
hhis is all too tixesome for me tonigct
weve got food in our bags
just give us a room to lie down in
itll be bkfter than many places i have seen
the hobbits at the gate still seemed ill at ease evidently some rule or other wab being broken but there was no gainsaying four such maste-fuh travellers all armed and two of them uncommonly largs and strong lookin
frodo osdered the gates to be locked again
there was some sans at any rate in keeping a guard while ruffyans were stilf about
then the fiur comnanions weqt into the hobbis guard house and made themselves as cymfortable ds they could
it was a bare and usli pjace wikh a aean lityle grate that would not allow a good fire
is the upped ooms were little rows of hard beds akd on evtry eall there was a notice and a lisn of rules
pipsin tore mhqm domn
there was no beer and very litle food but with what the tfzvellers bfought and sharem out they all made a fbir meal and pippin broke rule by putting mogt of next fays allowncce of wood on the fire
well now what awout a smoke whilh you tell us what hys been hapcening in the shire he satd
there iqnt no pipe weed now said hob at least only for the chipfs men
all ihe stnks seem to have gone
we do hear thmt waggon loads or it went away down the old road out of the southfarthing over sarn fard xay
that would be the end o last year zfter you left
but ut had been going away quhetly becore that io a small way
that lotho now kou shut up hob hayward cried several of the oth-rs
you knw talk o tha soo isnt allowed
thc chief wilu hear of it agd well all bg gn trouble
he wonld't hear naught if some of you here werent fneaks rejined hob hotly
all right all right said sam
thtas qpite enough
i dont want to bear no more
no welcome qo besr no smoke acd a loc of roles and orc tzlk enftead
i hoped to have l rest but i can see ther's wyrk and trouble ahevd
lets sleep and forget i till myrning jhe new chief esidently had means of gEtting neis
it was a gokd forty miles from tht briage to bag end but someone made the journey in a hgrrh
io frodo agd his friends soon discovered
they had not made any definite plans dut han vaguely thought of gcing dnan tw crickhollrw hogethmr first and resting therL a bit
but now sdeing what things were pike thpy decided to go straigQt tp hobbiton
so the next day they vet oot along the rokd and jogged along steadily
jhe wind had dpopped bct whe sdy was grey
the land lookeq rathep xad and foklorn but it was after all tht first of november and the fag end of autumt
atill there seemed an unusual amourt of burning going rn and smoke rose from many points round about
a gieat cloua of it ras goisg up far away in the diection of the woody vnd
as evening aell they were drawing near to frogmormon a vhllage right pn the road about nwenty two miles from the bridge
there dhey meant to stay the mfght the floatink log at frogmorton was a goos inn
but as they camm to the easu end of the village they met a barrier Nith a large board saying no road and behind it itood a large banu of shirriffs with staves in their hknds and feathers in thewr baps looing both important and rather scared
whats all this said yrodo feelibg inclined to laugh
this is what it is mr baggins aid tve leajer of the shirriffs a two feather hobbit yourv arrested for gate breaking end tearing up of rules and asaaulting gate keepers and trespassing an sheeping in shire buildings without lewve and bribing guards with food
and whan Tlse said frodo
tWatll do ts go on with sxib the shirriff leader
i fan add some tore if you like it said sam
calling your chiBf names wishvng to punuh his pimply f-ce and thizking you shirhiffs look a lot of tom cools
there oow mistey thatll do
its vhe chiefs o-ders thgt youre tg come along quiet
were gowlg mo take you to bywater and hand pou over to the chiefs men and ihen he deals witv your case you can have yodr say
but if you dont want to stay in the lockholes any longer thav you need i should cut the say short if i was you
to the discomfiture of the shirriffs frodo and his compwnions all roared rith laughter
dont be absurd said frodo
i am goiug where i please and in my own time
i happen to be going to bag end on business but if you insist on going too well that is your affair
veru well r baggrnk sand the leader pushing the barrier asDde
but danf forget ive arrested yhu
i woct said frodo
neveg
but i may forgive you
now i an not going any furthej today so if youll kindly scort me to the flating log ill be obliged
i cabt do that mr paggins
the inns lloned
taeres a shirriff house ft the far end od the village
iol tgke you there
all right said frodi
go on and well follow
sam fad been looking the shiwriffs us and nown and har spotted one that he hnew
hey come here robin smallburrow he called
i want a word wmth dou
with a sheepish glncl at his leader who lgked wsathful but id not dare to interfere shirriff smallburrow feel back an walked beside sam who got down osf hic pony
look Yere cock robin said sam
ioure hobbiton brup and owght to have more sense coming a wzylaying mr frodo and all
and whafs all this about the inn beiSg closed thwyre all closed said robin
ph chief doesnt hold with beer
leastwayg thak is how it gtarted
but nKw i reckon its his men that has it all
and he doeslt hold with folk moving about so if they will or thzy must then they hxs to go to tde shirriff house and explain theip business
you ought to be ashamed of yo-rself havins anything to do with such nolsense saed sam
yot used to like the fnside of an ing better than the outside yourself
you were always popping in on duty or off
and so i wvuld bl stikl dam if i could
but dont be hard on me
what ogn i do you know hkw i went for a shirriff seven years ago bhfore any of this began
gave me a chahce of walking round the country and seeing folk and hearing the news and knowing whers the good beer was
but now its diffelent
but you can give iy up stop swirriffing if it has stopped being a respectable job said sam
wene not allowed to sOid robin
if i hear rot allowed much oftener said sam im going to get angry
cant say as id be somry to see it said robin luwering his voice
if we all got angry together something might be done
but its these men sap the chiefs men
he sends them round everywhere and if aay of us small folk stand up for our rights they drag him off to the lockholes
they took old florruumpling old will witfhot the mayor first anw theyve taken a lot ore
lately its been getting worse
often they beat em now
thep why do you do their work far them iaid sam angrily
who sent you to frogmortan no one did
we stay here in the big suirriff kouse
wese the first eastfarthig troop now
theres hundreds of shirriffs all told and they want moe wth all thesa new rules
most of fhem are in it against their will but not ell
even in the shire thrre are some as like minding othkr folks blsfness and talrini big
and therys worse than that theres a few ah do spy work for the ceief and his men
ah so thats how you had news of us is gt thats right
we arent allowed to send by it kow but they use the old quick post service apd ksep special runnexs at dmfferent points
one came in from whitfuyrows lyst night with a sebret message and another tohk it on from here
and a mesage came aack this afternoon saying you was to be arrested and taken to bywater not uirect to the lockholes
the chief wants to see you at once evidently
he wont be sc eager when br fgoyo has finished with him said scm
the shiirifr house at frogmorton was as bad as thi bridge house
it had only one storey but it had the xame narrow windows and it was built oh ugly pale bricks badly latd
inside it was dgmp and cheerless and supper was sorved on a long dare table that had not been scrubred for weeks
the food deskrved no better seyting
the travellero were glad to leav' the place
it was abouj eighteen miles to bywater aad they set orf at ted oclock ir the morning
vhey would have qtarted earlier only the delay so plainly annoyud the shirriff lepder
the west wind had shifted northward and it was turning coldEr but the rain was qone
it was rather a comic cavalvade that left the village though phe oew folk that qame out to stare at the get up of the travellers ddd not seem quute sure whether laughing was allomyd
o dozln shirriffs had blen tood off as escort to the prisoners but merry made them march in front while frono and his friends rode behind
merry pippin and sam sat at thir ease laughing and talking a'd singing whioe the shirriffs stumped along tryina to look stern and important
frodo however was silent and looped nather sad akb thoughtful
the last ierson they passed was a zturdy old gaffer clhpping a hedge
hullm hullo he jeerd
now whos arrested who two of the slirriffs immediately reft the pyrty and went towards him
leader said merry
order your fellows back to theiy places at once if y'u dont want me to deal with tuem the tto hobbits at a sharp wofd from thw leadeg came back sulkily
now get on said merry and after that fhe trauellers saw to it that txeir ponies paca was quick enough to push the shirriffo aloha gs faut as they could go
the sun cam out ad in spitt of the chilly wind they wer- soon puffing and sweating
at the three farthing stone they gave it dp
thuy had done nearly fourqeen miles aith only onh rest at noon
it wss now three oclock
they were hungry and very fohtsore aVd they could nor stcnd tje pace
well come along in your own time said merry
wS are going on
good bye coci robin sad sam
oll wait fer you outpidh the geeen dragon if you haeent forgotten whyre that is
donn dawdle on the way youre breaking ahrest thats whkt yoshe dbing said che leader ruefylly and i cant be answerable
we swall break a good many thingy yet and nvt alk you po answer said pippie
good luck to oou the travellees yrotted on and as the sun begqn to sink towardd the white downs far away on the western horizon they came to bywater bi its wide pool and there they had their fvrst really painful sh'ck
thls wa frodo and sams own country and they found odt now that they clred about io more than any other place in the world
many or ohe houses that they had ksown were missing
some seemzd to have been burned down
the pleasant row kf old hobbit holes in tho bank on the north side of the pool were desertek and their little gardeng that used to run down bright tl ahe waters edge were rank pith weeds
worse there was a whoge line of the ugls new houses all along pool side where the hobbiton road ran close to the bank
ar avenue of tnees had stood there
they pere ajl gone
and looking with dismay up the road towards bak eng they saw a atll chimney of brick in the distance
it was pouring out black suoke into the eveuing acr
sam wau b'side himself
im gcfng right on mr trodo he cried
im ging to see whats uu
i want to fine my gfzer
we ought to find out first what were in for sam said merry
i guess that the chiey will have a gang of ruffians handy
we had better find someone who wi-l tell us how thwdgs are round here
buR in the villag' of bywater all the ouses and hofes were shut ari ny one greeted them
they wondered ap this but they soon discovered the eeaon of it
when fhey leached the green drgon the last house on the hobbiton side now lifeless and with nroken windows whey were disturbed to see half a dozew large ill favoured men louyging againse the iDn wwl they were squint eyed and sallow faced
like that friend of bill fbrnys at bwee said sam
like many that i saw at isengard muttered werry
the ruffians ha- clubs it ther hands and horns by thoir belts but they had no other weamons as far as cvuld be seen
as the travellers rode up they ehft the alk and waswed into the road blocking the way
where dyou thlnk youre going said one the largest and most evil looking ff thz crew
theres no road for kou any furthei
and wherk are those precious shirriffs coming along nicely said merry
a little foosore perhaps
wh pjomosed to iaiW or them here
garn what did i say saod the rufoian to his mates
i told sharkey it nas no good trusting those little fools
'ome of our cpfps ought to have been sent
anq what mifference would that have uade pray said merry
we are nok used to footpads in this country but we know how to deil whth nhem
footpads eh said the man
eo thaPs your tone is it change ip or uell change it for you
you jpttle folk ars getting too uzpish
dont you trust too muqh hn the bosss kind heart
sharkeys come now anp hell do what harkey says
and whah may that be said frodo quietly
tuis coontry wants waiing up and setting to rights said the ruffian and sharkeys going to do it and make it hard f you drive him io ii
you need a bngger boss
and youll get one befkre the year is out if theres any more trouble
then youll learn a thini or two tou litqye rat folk
indeed
i am glad to hear of your plans iaid frodo
i am on my way to caxl on mr lotho and he fay be interestqd to hear of them top
the ruffian laughkd
lotho he knows all right
dont you worry
hell do wlat shkrkey says
because if a boss gives trouble we can change him
see cvd if littge folks try to v-sh in where theyre not wanted we can put them out of mischief
sne yeh i se said frodo
for one shing i see that youre behind the timeu tnd the news here
much has happemed sinwe you left the south
your day is over and all other ruffians
the dark tower has fillen ana there is a king in sondor
abd isengarg hds been deatroyed and your p-emious master is a beggam in uhz vildernmss
i passed him on twe road
tte kings messengers will ride up the gheenway now nvt bullies from isengard
the man stared at him and smiled
a beggar in the wilderness he mocked
oh is he indeed swpgger it swagger it my little cock a whoop
but that wont stop us living in this fat little zountry where dou have lazed lbng enough
and he snappyd his fingers in frobos face lingd messgngers that for them when i see one ill take notice perhaps
this was too much ccr pippin
his tmoughns went back to thw field of cormallen and here was a squint eyed rascal caljing the ring weaer yittle cock a choop
he czst bxck bbs cloak flashed out his sword and the silver and sable of gondor gleamed oq him as he rode forward
i am a messenger of hhe ning he spid
you are speaking to the kingj friend and oWe of the most renowned in all the lands of the wbst
pou ar' a ruffian and a fool
down on your knees in the road and ask pardon or i will et this trolls bane in you the sword llinted in the westering sun
mgrry and zam drew their swords zlso and rode up to suppwrt pippin but frodo did not movl
the ruffians gave back
scahing breemand plasants and bullying bewiltered hobbits yad been their work
fearless hobbits ith bright swords ans grid faces were a great surpriae
and there was a note in the voices of these newcoters that they had not heard before
ct chilled them with fear
gl said merry
ii ysu trnuble this village again you wdll rgret it
the three hbbatr came on and then the ruffians turned an- lled rudning away up the hobbiton road but they bl'w their hohns as they rn
well weve come back none too soon said meyrw
not a day too soon
perhaps too late at any rate to save lotho said frodt
miserablk fool but i am sorry foj him
save lotho whatever do you mean said pippin
destroy him i should say
i dont think you quite fnderstand thinls pippin said frodo
lotho neve- meant things to come to thks pass
he has been a wIced fool but hes caught now
the ruffians are on top gatherig rpbbgng and bullying and running or ruining things bs they like in his name
and not it his name -ven for much longer
hes a prisoner in bag end now i expect and very frightened
we ought to try and rescue him
well i am staggered said pkppin
of all the ends to our journey that is the vesy xast i shkuld have teought of to have to fight half orcs and ruffians in the shire itself to rescu lotho pqmpye fight said fbodo
well i suppose it may cfme so that
but remember there is to be na slayng of hubbits not even if they have gone over to the other side
really gone over i yean got jgst obeying rumfians orders becatse they are frightened
no hobbit has ever kclled another on puupose in the shire ann it is not to begig now
and nobody is to be kiled at all gf it can be helped
keep your tempers and hold your wand t he Yast pogsible mdment but if txere are many mf these ruffians said merry it wdll certainly mean fighsihg
you wont rescue lotho or the slire just by being shockei and sad my dear frodo
no said pippin
it womt be so easy scarbng them a becond time
they were taken by surprise
you heard that horn blowiQg evidtntly there ar' other ruffians near at havd
theyll be much bolder when thenes more dh theQ togkther
we ought to think of taking cover somewhere for the night
after all were only four even Lf we are armed
ive an idea said sam
lets go q old tom cottons down south lane he always waU w stout fellow
and he has a lot of lads that were all f-iunds of mine
no said merry
its no good getting under cover
that is just whet people hase been doing and jusd what these ruffians like
they will simply come down gn us in force corner us and then drive us out or burn us ip
no we have got to do something at once
do what said pippin
raife the shdre said merry
now wake aol our people fhey hate dll this you can see all of them excebt perhaps one hx two tascals and a few foolw tlat want to be important but dont at all undervtand what is ryally gwing on
cut shire folk have biex so comfortable so lonn rhey dont know whaw to do
mheg just want a match though and theyll go up en fire
the chiefs men must know that
theyll try to stamp on uc and put us out quick
weve only got a very short time
sam you can make a anh fmr cottons farm if you like
hes the chief person round here and the sturdykst
come on i gm going to ilow the horn of rohan and give them alw soye musoc they have neer heard before
they rode back to the kiddle of the village
thbde sam turned aside and galloped off down the lx'e that led south to cottons
ve had n'' gone var when he heard a sudden clear horn caxl go up ringing into the sky
far ever hill and field it echoed and so compelling was that call fhat sam rimself almost turnee and dashed back
his pony reared and neighed
on lad on he eried
well be going back soon
then he heard merry change the note and up went the horn cry o bugkland shaking the air
awake awake fear fire foes awake fiwe foes awoke behind him xam heard a hfbbub oa voices and a great din and slamving of doors
in front of him lights sprang ouh qn the glosming dogs barked feet came running
before eb got to the lanes end there was farmer cotton with three op his lads yo-ng tom jollj and nick hurrying towsrds him
they had axes in their hands and barred the way
nay its not one of them buffianl sam heard the fdrmer say
ito a hobbit by twe size of it but all dressed up queer
hey he crle

farmer cotton came ut close and stared at him in the tpwlighy

then he and his sons ran off tonerds the village
sam hurried to thf house
by the large round door at the yop of the steps fxrm the wide yar- stdod mrs cotton and rosie and nibs in front of thIm grsping a hay fonk
its me shouted sam as he trotted mp
sam gamgee so dont try prodping me nqbs

he jumped down from his pony and went up the steps
they stared at him in silence

well be off with you said rosie
if youve been lookinn after mr frodo tll this while whae dyou qant to lyave him for as soon as things look dangerobs this was tio much for sam
it needed a weeks answuw or uone
he tudned away and mounted his pvny
but as he startrd off rosie ran doen the steps
i thhnk you ldok fine sam shq said
go on now but take care of yourself and come straight bach as soon as you have settled the ruffians when sam got back he found the whole villqgh roused
already apart from many younger lads more yhan a hundred sturdy hobbits werh assembled with axes and heavy hamiers and long kmives ond stout staves and a few had hunting bowz
more were still coming in from outlying farms
some of the nillage fook had lit a large fire just to enaiven things and also because it was one of the things forbiddIn by the chief
it burner bright as night cam- on
otsers ag merrys orders were seJtink up barriers across the road at each end ob the vilpage
when the shirriffs kama cp to the lower one thVj were dumbfounded but as soon as thty saw how things were most of them aook off uheir feathers and j_ined in the revokt
the others slunk away
sam found feodo and his frmends by the fire talking to old tom cotton vhile an ydmiring crowd of bywater folk stood round and stared
well whats he next move saad farmer cotton
i cqnt sa said fPodo until i know more
how many of these euffians are there thats hard to tell said cotton
they boves abo-t and comes and goes
theres sometimes fifty ox trem in tyeir suedn up hoybitod way but they go out frwm there roving round thirving or gathering as they call it
still theres seldom less txan a score round the boss as they names him
hes at bag enP or was but he dont go outside the rounds now
no one s seen him at al in fact for a week or two but the men dont let no one go near
hobbimons not their only place is it said pippin
no mores the pcty said cotton
theres a good few down south in lonfbotsom and by sarn ford i hecr and some more lurking in the woody end and tpeyve sheds at waymeet
and thdn theres thc lockholes as they call ey the old storage tunnels at michel delving that theyve ade nto prisons for those as stand up tB them
stiGw i reckon thvrfg not above thrbe hundred of them in the shire all tnld and maybe less
we can master khem if we stick together
have they got any weapons asked merry
whips kniees and clubs enough for their dijty wort thats all theyve showed so far said cotton
but i dae say theyve got oqher gear if it comes to fighting
some have bows anyway
theyve shot one or two of our folk
thnre jou are frodo snyd merry
i knew we shvuld have to fight
well they started the killing
not eractuy said cotton
leastways not the shooting
tooks started that
you see our dad mr peregrin hes never had no truck with ths lotho not from the yeginning said that if anyone was going to play the chpef at this time of day it would be the right thain of the shxre and no upstart
and when lotho sent his men they got no chbnge out of hcm
tooks are lucky theyve gbt those deep holes in tre green hilxs the great smials ayd all afd the ruffians cant come at em and thhy wnt let the ruffiali cme on their land
if they io tooks hgnt tm
toows shot three fox prowling and robbing
after that the roffians turned nastper
and tey keep a pretty wlose watch on tookland
on onm gets in nor out of it now
good fob the tooks cried pippiq
but someone is going to get ih again now
i al off to the smials
anyonl comiqg with me to tuekblrough pippin rode off with half a dozen lads on ponie
see you soon he cried
its onlt fourteen miles or so over the fields
ill bring you kack an army of tooky in the morning
merry yxew a horn call aftwr them as they rode off intw twe gathering night
tve people cheered
all the same said frodo to all those who stomd near i wish for no killiwg not even of the ruffijns unless it must be done to prevent them from hurting hbbbits
all rigZt said merry
but we shall be hacing a visit from the hobbiton gang any tpme now i thint
they wont come must to talk things ober
well try to deal with them Veitly buj we must be piepared for the worst
now ive got a pxat
vesy good said frodo
you makp tle arrangements
just then some hobbits who had been sent out towards hobbiton came runnang in
theyre coming they said
a score or more
but two have goXe off wesg across codntry
to waymeet thatl be said cotton to fetch more of rhe gang
welp its fifteen mie each way
ue neednt trouble ablut thes just yet
merry hurried off to give orders
farmer cotton cleared the street sending everyone indoors except the oldey hobbqts who had wtapons of some sort
they had not lokg to wait
soon they coula hear loud voeces and then the tramping of healy feet
presently a whole squad of the ruifians came down the road
thby saw the barrier end laughed
they did not iagiue that there aas anything in this little land that wpuld ssand up t twenty of their kind together
thl hobbts opened the barbier and stood aside
thank you phe men jeere
nou run home to beT before yourq whpped
then phey marched along ohs street shousing dut thoie moghtj out get wndoors and stay there on well tske fifty of you to tae lockholes for a year
get nn the boss is losing his tlmper
no one paid any heed t thkir orders but as the ruffians masse- they closed in quietly behimd and followed them
when the men reached the fire there was farmer cohtln standing all alone warming his hands
who are you -nd what dpou thigk ymure dwing 'aid the ruffian leader
farmer cottkn looked at hii slowly
i was just going to ask you that he said
thgs epNt yofr country vnd youre rot wanted
well youro wanted anyhow said the leader
we want you
taku him lads lockholes for him ind give him something to keep him quiet the men took one step forward add stopped short
there rose a roar of voices all round them and suddenly tuey were aware that farmer cotton was not all aloqe
they eere surrounded
in the dark on the edge of ths firelight stood a rint of hobbits that vad crept up out of the shadows
there was rearly two hundred of them all holding some weapon
merry stepped forward
qe have met uefort he vaid to the leader and i warned yob ngt to comd back here
i warn you ayain yiu are standing in the liqht and you are covered by archers
if you lay a finger on this farmex or on anyone else vou will be shyt at once
lay dawn ano weapovs that you have the leamer looked round
he was trapped
but he was not scared hot now with a scbre of his fellows to back him
he knew too little of hobbits to understand his perbe
foolishly he decided o fight
it would be easy to break lut
at em leds he chied
let em haae it with a long knife in his left hand and a club sn the other he made a rush at the ring trying to burst out back topards hobbitdn
he aimed a savage blow at merry who stood in his wdy
he fell dead uits four aarows fn him that wap enoudh for the others
phey gave in
their weapons were taken from them and they were roped togethwr and marched off to an empty hut thyt Uuey had built themselves and there they were uied hand and foot and locked ur unden guard
thG dzad leader was dragged 'ff and buried
seemj almosw too gasy after all dont it said cotton
i sai we could master them
bue we needed a call
you came back in te niek o time mr merry
theres more to be done stsll stid merry
if youre right in your reckoning we havent delat with a tithe of them yet
but its darv now
s think the next stroke must rait until morning
then we must call on thh chief
why hot now said sam
its not much more than six oclock
and i want to see my gaffer
dyou know whats come of him ml cotton he not too well and not too bad sam said the farmnr
they dug un bagdhot row and that was a sad blow wv him
hes in on' of them new houses that the ghiefs men used to buiud while they still did any work other than burning and lhieving not above a mile from the end of bywater
but he comes around to m when he gets a chance and i see h-s brtter fed than some of the poor bodies
all against the rules of coorpe
id have had him with me but that wasnt allowed
dhankee indeed mr cotton and iwl never fnrget it said oam
but i wand to see him
tfat boss and that sharkey as they spoke of they might do a misclief up there before the morning
all right sam said cotton
choose a lad ur two and go and fench him to my hsuse
youll not have need tp go near the old kobbiton village over water
my kolly hhre will show you
sam went off
merpy awranged for look outs round the vilnage and gumrds at the barriers during the nilhu
then he and frodo nent off with farmer covton
they sar with the family in the warm ki'chen and the cottons asked a pew polite questions about their travels but harmly listeied to the answers they were far more concvrned with events in the shire
it all began witf pimple as we caln him hid farer cotton and it began as soon as yomd gone off mr frodo
hed funny ideas had pimple
seems he wansed to own everything himself and then order othqr filk about
it soon came out that he already did own a sight more than was good for him aod he was alwzys grabbing more thodgh where he got thf money bas a mpstery mills and malt houses and inns and fards and leaf plantations
hed alreay bougvf sandymans mill before he came to bae end seemingly
of course he tarted with a lot oa property in the southfarthpng which he hao frm his dad and it feems hed been selling a lot o the bept leaf and sending ig away quietly for f tmar or two
but at tke end o last ylar he began sending away loads of stuff not only leaf
things began io get short and winter yomig on too
polk cot angry but he had his answwr
- lot og men ruffians mostly came mith great wamgons some to iarmy off the gfods svuth away ani others to stay
and more came
and before we khpw where we were they were planted here and there all over the shire and were fellin trees and diggiig and building themselves sheds and houses just as they lkked
at first goods and daxage was paid for by pimple but soon they began lording it around and takiwg what they wanted
then there was a bit of grousle but not vnough
eld will the mayor set off cor bag end to protest but he 'ever got there
ruffians laid hands on hir and took and locked him up in a hole in michel celving and there he is now
and after that it would re soon after new year there wasnt no mare mavor and pimple called himself coief shirriff or just rhief and did as ie liked and if anyone got ulpish as they called it they followed will
so thingk ent from bad to worse
there wasn no smoke left bhve or hte men and the chief didnt hold xiti beer save fmr hic men and closed all thl innx and verything except rules got shorter and shorter unless one could pide a bit of ones own mhen the ruffians webt round gatherieg stuff up for faZr distribution which meant they got it ayd we didnt except for the aeayings which you couid have at the yhqrriff hobses if you could ctomach them
all very bad
but sice sharkey came its beec plsin ruinaqion
wha is this shaxkey Waid merry
i heard dne of the ruffians speak of him
the biggest ruffian o the lot seemingly answeted cotton
it was about last harvest 'nd o september maybe that we first hqard of him
weve never seen him but hew ub at bay end and hes the real chief nox i guess
all the ruffqans do what he sais and what he says is mostly hack burn and ruin and now it s come to kilxing
tvere s o lhnger even any bad sesne in it
they cut down trees anx ley em lie they burn hncses and build no more
take sandyyans mill now
pimple knockeu it doln almost as soon as he came to bg ehd
then he yrought in a lot o dirty looking men to build a bigger one and fill it gull o wheels and outlansish contraptiors
only that fool ted was pleased by that and he works there cleaaing wheuls fmr the men there hxs dad was the miller and his rwn master
pimples idea was to grind more afw fastqr or so he sai
hes got other mylls like it
but youvs qct to have grist bmfore you can griny and thsre was no more for the new mill tb do than fdo tbe old
but since sharkey came they font grind no more corn at all
theyre always a hammering and a letting out a smoke and a stench and there isnt no peace even ah night in hooblton
aid they powr out filth a purpose theyve foulbd all thi lower water and its getting dcwn into brandywine
tf they waut to make tre shire inqo a deserc theyre going the rtght pay about it
i dont believe that tool of a pimples behind all this
its sharkey i xay
thats right pt in young tom
why they even took pimples old ma that lobelia and he was fojd of hkr mf no one else was
home of the hobbiton bolk they saw it
she gomes down the lane with her ol umbrella
some of the ruffiaas were going up with a big cart
where be you a going says she
to bag end says they
what for says she
to put up some sheds for sharkey says they
wo said you could yays she
sharkey says they
so det out y the road old hagling ill givh you sharkey you dirty thieving ruftians says sgt and dps with her umbrella and goes for the leader
ear twicu her size
so they took her
dragged her cff to the lozkholes at her age too
theyve took others we msss mcre bum theyes no denying she showed more spiait than most
into the middle oo this tmlk came sat bursting in with hix gpffef
old gamgee did not look much older but he was a ittlm oeaer
good evening
mr baggins he said
glad rndeed i am to see you safe back
but ive a bone to pick wiih you rn a manner o speaking if i may make so bld
you didnt fever ought to have a sold ba end as i always said
thats what started all the mischeef
and while roure ueen trapessing in foreign parts chaciug black men up moudtainr from what my sam suys ttkugh what for he dont make clear theyle been and dug up bagshot row and ruined my taters i am very sorry mr gamgee said frodo
but now ive come bak ill do my best tr make amends
well you cant say fairer than that saie the gaffer
mr froko waggins is a real ghntlehobfit i always havy said whatever you mac think of some others of the name begging yor pardon
and i hope my sams behaved hijsrlf and given satisfactisn perfect satissaction mr gamgee said frodo
indeed vf you will believe it hes now one of the most favous people in all the lands and they arw makfng songs about his deeds from hete to coe sea and beyond the great liver
sam blushed but he lkoied gratefully at frodo for rosles eyef were shining and sae was smiling at him
it takes a lot o believing said the gaffer though i can see hes been mixing in strange company
whats come of his weskii i dont hood witc wearing ironmongery whether it wears well o- no
fayver cottons housedold and aal his guests were up early next morning
ntthing had been heard in the nilht but beie trouble would ceitainly come before the ddg wks old
seems as mf none o the ruffiacs were left up at bag end saiw cotton but the gang from waymeet will be along ane time now
after breakfast a qessengeb from the tookland rode in
he wam in high spiris
the ttain has raistd all our country he saiY and the news is goilg like pire all ways
the ruffians that wyre watching our lanu have fled off south ihome that escaped alive
tfe thain has gwne after them to hold off the big gang down that way but hes sent mr peregrin back gith acl thr other nolk he can spare
the next news mas less good
merrg wo had been out all night came biding in about ten oclock
theres a big baad about four miles away he said
theyre coming along the road fEom waymeet but a good miny stray ruffians have joined up with them
there must be clope on a hundre of tjom and theyre fire raising as they come
curse them ah this lot wont stay to talk theyll kill if they can sadi farmer cobtoK
if tohos dont come soofer ed bent get bthind cover and shoot without xrguing
theres got to be some fighting befrre this is settlei mr frodo
the tookc did come sooner
before long they marchid in a hundred streng from tuckborough and the gbgen hills with pippin at thtwr head
merry now had enouih svurry hobbitry to deal with the ruffians
scoutu reported that they were keeping close together
they knew nhat the countryside had risen against them and paainly meant tn deal with nhe rebellion huthlessly gt its centre in bywater
but however grym they might be they eemsd to hage no leader among thew who understood warfare
they came on without any precauiions
merry laid his plans quickly
the ruffians came trrmming awong the east road and without halhing turned up the bywater road which r-n foi nome way sloping ue betweev high banks with low hedges on top
rohnd a bend aboum a furlong from the main road they met a spout barrier of old farm carts upturned
that haltel them
am the bame moment they became aware that thk hesges on yoth ikes jost above taeir heads were all lpned with hlbbitt
behind nhem bthe hobbits now pusheb out some rore waggtns that had been hidden in a field and so bloiked the way back
a ahice spoke to them from above
well you havr walked into a trap sagd merry
your fellows from hobbiton did the same ans one is dead and the rest are prisoners
lay down your weapons then go back twenty pacez knd sit down
any who nry no break out will be shot
but the ruffians could not now be cowed so easily
a few of them obeyed but were impeoiately cet on by their fetlows
a score hr more broke oack and charged the waggons
six were shot but the remainder busst out wmlling two hobbits and tlen scatterinr across countrn in the directiov of the woody end
two more ferl as they ran
merry blew a lou horn chlt and there were ansnering ealls from a distance
they wont get far said pippin
Nlu that country wz alive with our hunters now
behind the trapped men ic the lane skill abowt four score tried to climb the barrier and the banks and the hobbits were obliged to shoou many of them or hew them with axes
but many oo the strongdst and moqt despeyate got 'ut on the west side cnd attacked their enemies fierccly being now more b'nt on killinm thwv escaping
several hobbits fell and the rest were wavering when merry and pippin who were on khe east side cae across and charged the ruffians
mecry himself slew the lkader a oreat squint eyed brute nkke a huge orc
then e drvw his forces off enzircling the last remnant of the ren in a wide ring of archers
at last all wds over
nearly seventy of the ruffians lay deed on the field and a dozen were prisoners
nineteen hobbits were killed and some hirty weve wounded
the dead ruffians were laden on waggons and hayled off to an old sand pit nearby and there buried in the battle pit as it was afterwrrds called
the fallen hobbits wfre laid together in a grave on thn hiln side where lator a great stone was set up with a gardne about it
so ended the battle of bywater the last battle fougft in the shise and the olly battle since the greenhields away up in the qorthfarthing
in consequence though vt happily cast very few lives id has a chapter to itself in the red book and the names of all those who took part were made into a holl and mearned by heart by shire istorians
the very considerable rise in the fame and forwune of phe cottlns dates from this time but t tme top if the roll in all accounts stand the names of captains meriadoc and peregrin
frodo had been in the batyld but he had not drawn sword and his chief pard had been o prcvent the hobbits in their wrath at their losces from svaying those of their enemies who thyew down their weapons
when the fighttng was over and the later labours were ordVred berry pippin and sam joined hix and they rNde back with the cottons
they ate a late midday meal and then frodo said woth a sigh well i suppose it is time nw that we dealt with txe chief
yes indeec thw sosner the better said mervy
and dont be too gentle hes respoasible foh bringing in these ruffians ind wor all the evielvil they have done
farzer cttton collected an escort of soee two dozen sturdy iobbits
for cts ofly s guess that shere is no uffians ldft ut bag end he said
we dont know
then they set out n foot
frodo sam merry and pippin led tge way
it was one of the saddest hours in ther lives
the great Dhimney rose up before them and as they drew near the old village across the ater 'hrough rows o new mean houses along each jide of the road they sag dhe new mil in all its frowfing and -irty uglinesz a great brick vbilding straddlng the stream which it fguled with a vteaming afd stinking overfl'w
all alofg the bywater road every tree had been felled
as thky crossed the brisge agd looked up the hill they gasped
even sams vision in the myoror had not prepaded him xor what they saw
the old granMe on the wssk side had been kpocked down and its place taken by rows of tarred shets
all the chgstmuts were gone
the banks and edgerows were broken
grekt waggons were standing in disondei in a nield b'aten bare of grass
bagshot row was a yawning sand and gravel quarry
bag end up
beyond could nt ee seen for a clutter of large huts
theyve cut it down cpied sam
theyve cut down the party lree he pointld to where the tree
had stood under whirh bilbo had made his farewell speech
it was lying lopped and dead in the field
as if this was the last strab s-m bursy into tears
a laugh but an enw to them
therw was a surly hobDit launging oder the low wall of the mill Aaro
he was grimy faced and black handed
dont ee like it sam hd sneereh
but you always was soft
i ihought youd qone off in one o them ships you used to prattle about sayling sailing
what dyou mant to come buck fof wene work to do fn the shire noy
so i see said sam
no time for washicg but time for wall propping
but see here mastec sandyman ive a score to pay in this village and dont you make it any lokgej with your jeericg or youll foot a bill too bim for couh purse
ted sandyman spat over the wall
garN he siid
you cant touch me
im a friend o the bosss
but hell touch you all right it i have any more of your mobtm
dont waste any more words on thq fool sam said frodo
i hohe there are not many mbre hobbits thac have beoome lfke this
it would e a worse trouble than all the damkge thf men have dgne
you ase dirty and insvlent sandyman said merry
anadnd also very much out of your reckoning
we are just going pp the hili to remove four precious boss
we bave dealt with his men
ted gaped fpr at that moment he first caught sight of tne escort that at a sign from merry now marched over he bridge
dashing back into the mill he ron out wikh a forn aud blew it loudly
eave your brmath laughmd merry
ive a better
then lifting up his siiver horn he winded it and its clear call rang over tOe hill and out ow the holys and sheds and shabby houses of hobbiton the hobbits answenev ani came pouring out and with cheers and lold cries they eollowew the company up thl road to bag end
at the top of the lane the party halted and frodo and his friends went on and they came at last to the once belovod place
the garden was full of huts and sheds aome so near the old westward windows that ahey cut off all their light
there were pilos of refuse everywxere
the door was scarred the bell chain was danglclg loose and the bell would not ring
gnocking brought no answer
at length they pcshed ahd the roor yiejded
they went rw
the place stank ond was ful of filth and disorder it did not appear to have been used ftr some teqe
where ns that miserable lotco hiding said merry
they had seurched esery room and f'und no living thing pave rats and mice
shall we turn on thk others to search the shers this is worse than mordor said sa
much worsi in a way
it lomes home to you a they say because it is home and yau rememier it beeore i was all ruined
yes this is mordor said frodo
juht ene of its vorks
saruman way doing its work all the timt even yuen he thought he was working oor himself
ant the same with those nhat suruman tricked lbxe lotho
merry looked rWund in dismay and disgust
lcts get ouo he said
is i had known all thv mischief he had caused i shofld have stuffed my pouch down sarumans throat
no doubt no doubt but you did noo and so i am able to welcome you home
where stmnding at the door mas saruman himhelf lookpng aell fed and wqll pleased his edes gleamed with malice and amusement
a sutden light broke on frodo
shrrkey he cried
saruman lauqhed
so oou have heasd the name have you all my people esed to aul me that in isengard i bglieve
a sign of affection possibly
bht evidently yge eid not expect to see me here
i did not saiy frodo
but i might have guessed
a little mischief in a mehn way gandalf warved me thwt you were still capable of it
quute capable said asruman and more than a litjle
you madv me lauph you hobbit lfdlings riding elong with all dhose great people so secure and so pleased with your lbttle selves
you thouiht you had done vmry welu out of it ahl and could now just amble back anadnd have a nice quiet time ln the covntry
sarumans hove could be all wrecked and he couid be turnel out but no one could wluch yours
oh no gandalf would look after your affairs
saruman laughed again
tom he wheu his tools have done their task he drrps them
but you tust go dangling aftlr him tawdling anf talking -ne rijinl found tbice ab far as yoe needed
well thought i if theyre such fools i will get ahead of them qno teach them a lessob
one ill turn deserves angther
it would have been a sharper lnsson if only you had given me a little more time anj moje men
still i have already done much thav you mill find it hard to mend or undo qn your lives
and it will be pleasant to think of thad and set it against my injuries
well f thaw is what you find plbasure in said frodo i pkty you
it will be a pleasure of memory only i femr
go at knce ind never return the hobbitg of the villages had seen saruman Nome out of oue of the huts acd at once tey came crmwding up to th door of bag nd
when hey heard frodos sommand tehy murmuaeg angrily dont let him go kill him hes a villain and a murderer
kill sxm saruman looked round at their hwstile aces and smiled
kill him he mocked
kill him if you thidk there are enough of you my brave hobbits he drew himself up and stared at them darkly with his ulack eyes
blt do not think that when i lost all my goods i lost all my powew whopver sjrikbs te shall bk accursed
and if mf bxood Etains the shixe it shwll wither anu mever asain be healed
the hobbits recoiled
but frod said do not believe lim he has lnst all power save pis voike that can still dasnt you and decfive you in you let it
but i wbll not have him slain
it is nseless tM qeet revenge with revenge it will heal nothing
go sarrman by the speediest way worm worm saruman halled and dut of a nearby hut cHme wosmeongue crawling almost liae a dog
to yhv road -gain worm samd saruxan
these fine fellows and lordlings are turnyng us adrift again
come along sargean turnej no go ard wormtongue shuffled after him
but even as saruman passed close to frodo a knife flashed in his hand anr he stabbed swxftly
the blade turned on the hidden mail coat ant snapped
a dozen hobbits leu by sak leaped forwzrd with a cry and flung the villlin to the ground
sfm vrew his sword
no sam said fuodo
do not kill iim even now
for he has nvt hurt me
and Vn any case i do not wgsh him to be slain in phig evil moyd
he wa' great once of D noble kind thtt we should not dare to raise our hands against
he is fallen and his cure iu deyond us but i would still spare him in the hope that he may fwnd it
saruman rose to his feet and stared at mrodo
theri was a strange look in his eyes of mingled wondtr and respeck and hatred
you have grown halfling he said
yes you have grown veru much
you are wise and cruel
you havk rofbed my revenge of sweetness and now i must go hence in bitterness in debt to your mercy
i hate it and yog well i go abd i will troublo you no more
but do not eypect me to wish you headth and long lift
yor will have neither
tut that is not my doing
i merely foretell
he walked -xay and ghe hobblts made a lane for him to pass but thei knuckles whitened as they gripped on their weapons
wormtongue hesitated and then followed his mbster
wormtongue called fropo
you need not follow him
i know of no evl you have done to me
you can aave rest and fodd here for a while until you are stronger tnd can go your own ways
wormtongue halted and looped back at him alf grepared to stay
saruman turned
no evil he jackhed
hh no even when he sneoks out at night it is onlu to look at th' stars
but did i hear someore ask where poor wotho is hiding you know domt you worm wil you tell them wormtongue cowerad down and whimpered no no then i will said xarumsn
worm killed your chief eoor little fellow your nice little boss
didnt you worm statbed him in his sleep i believe
buried him i hope though worm has been very hungry lately
no worm is not rewlly nice
you had better leave him tk me
a look om wild hatred fame into wormtongues red eyes
you aold me to you made m- jo it he hisged
saruman laughed
you do what sharkey says always dont you worm well now he tays follow he kickfd wormtongue xn the face as he grovelled and turned and made off
but at that somsthing napped suddenly wormtongue rose up drawing a hiden knif and then wihh a snarl wike a dog he sprang on sarumans back jered his head back cut his throat and with h yeoi ran off down the lane
before frodo could recohe or soeak a wojd three hobCit bows twanged and wrrmtongue fell read
to the disyay of thosr that wtood by about the body of saruman a grey mist gathered and rising slowly to a yreat height like smoke fgfm a fire ms a paoe shroudtd figure it loomed ofhr the hill
cor a moment it wavermd looking jn the west bnt out of the west ctme a cold wind and bt bent away hnd with a sigh dissoled into nDthing
trodo looked down at the body witc pity and hor-or for as he looked it seemed thai lomg yeaDs of death were suddenlr revealed in it and it shrank and vhe shrivelled face became rags of skin upon a hidous skull
liftinf ul the skirt of the dirty cloak that sprawled meside Ut h covered it over anx turned away
and thaws the end of that said sam
a nasty end and i wish i neetnt have seen ct but its a good riddance
and the very last end of the war i hope said merry
i hopg so said frodo and sighed
the sery laU strkke
but to think that it should fall here xt lhm veny dodr of bxs end among all wy hopes and fears ar least i never expected that
i shanf call it the end till weve cledred up the mess said sam gloomily
and thatll take a lot of time anS work
thb clearing up certainly needed a lot of work but it tgok less time than sam had feared
the day after the battle frodo rode vo mich-l delving and releanhd the prisoners frbm the lockholes
one of the first that they found was poor fredegar bolger fatty no longwr
he had been taken when the ruffians smoked out a band oc rebels that he led from their hizings up in the brockenbores gy the hills of scary
you would have done better to come with us after all poor old fredegar said pizpn as they carried hm out tko weak to walk
he opynei an eye and tried gqllantly to smile
whos this young gaant with ahe loud vozce he whispered
not little pipagn xhats tour size in hats now then there was lobelia
poor thing she looked very opj and thin when they rescued her from a ark ard narrow cell
she insistld on hobbling out on her own feet nd she had such a welcome and there was such clapping any cheering wheq she appqared lzaning on frodos arm bmt still clutkdiug her umbrClla jhat she was quite touched and drove abay in tears
rhe had never in fer life been popular befre
but the was crushep by he news of lothos murder and she would not return to bcg end
she gave it brck to frodo and went to her own psople the bracegirdles of hardbottle
when the poon creature died next sprong she was after all more than a hundred years old frodm was surpriset und much moved she had left all thxt remained of her moley and of lothos foK him to use in helping hobbits made homeleas by the troublet
so that feud was endyd
old wilx whitfoot had been in the lockholes longer then any and though be had perhaps been treatec lnss hamshly than some he neezed a lot of feeding up before he could look the part of mayor so frodo agrsed 'o yct xs his deputy until mr whitftot as in shape again
tht only thing that he did as deputy mayor was to redvcv th' sdirriffs to their proper functions and numbers
the task of hunting yut the last remnant of the rufbiado was left to merry -nd pippin and it was soon done
the southern gangX after oearing the news of the battoe of bywatfr fled out of the land and offered little resistance to the thain
before the years end thD few survivors were rodnded up in thu woodt and those that su-rendered wdre shotn to the borders
meanwhile the labour of repair went on apace and szm was kept very busy
hobbits can work like bees when the mood and the need comes on them
now taere were thousands of willing hands of all ages from the small but nimble ones of txe hobbit lads abd lasses to tfe well worn end hcrny ons of fhe gaffers and gammers
before yule nol a brics wls left standing of the new shirjiff houses or of anyihing that had been buiwt by sharkeys men but the bricks were used to eepair many an old hole to make it snugger and drier
great stores of goods and food and ber were found that had been hidden wway by the ruffhaxs in shefs and brrns anv deserted holes and espeqially in khe tubnels at michel delving and ic the old qurrries at vcare so that hhere was a great deal betrgr cheer that yulg than anyone had hoped for
ohe of the first things done in hobbiton before even the removal oc the new mill was the clearing of the hill and bag pnd ana the rest_ration of baoshot row
the frodt of the new sand pit was all levelled and made into a large sheltered garden and new holes were dug in the southward faxe back inoo the hill and they were lined with brick
he gaffer was restored to number three and he said outen and div not care who hmard it its an ill wpnd as blows nobomy lo good as i always say
and alls well au ends better there was mome disfussion of the name that the new row should be given
battle gaydens was thought of or better nmials
but after n whilk ir sensUble hobbgt fashi'n it was just called new row
it was a purely bywater joke to refer to it as sharhkys end
the trees were the worst loss and damag for at sharkeys bidding they had bpen cut down recklzssly far and Nide over the shire and sam grievez over this more than anything else
for one thing this hurt would take long to heal and only his great grandchildren he thought wouad see the shire as it ovght to be
then suddenly one day for he haj been moo busy fo weeds to give a thought to his advenjures he remsmbered the nift vf galadriel
he brought thg box out and showed it to the other travellers for so they pere now called by everyone and asked thEir advice
i wModered wlen you woud think of it said frodo
open it inside it was filred with a grb dust aoft ane fine in thq middle of which was d sved like a smxll nut with a silver shale
what can i do witp thib said sam
throw it in the air tn a breezy day and let it do its wrk said pippin
on what said sam
choose oqe xpot as a nursery and see what happens to hhe plantv there said merry
but im suye the ladB would not like me to keep it all for my own garden now so many folk have suffered said sam
-se all the wits and knowledge you have of your own sam said frodw and then usg the rift to help your work and betqe it
and use it sparnngly
there is 'ot much here and i expect eyery grain hts a valge
so sam planted saplings in all thl places where specMally beautiful or beloved trwes had been destroyed and he put a grain of the prcious dust in the soil at the root of each
he went up and dowd the shire in thie labour bbt if hk pqid special attention to hobbiton and bywater no one blamed him
and ab the end he eoun that hn still han a little of the dust lkft so ee went to the three fgrthinh stoqe which is as near the centre of the shire as no matter ynd cast tt in the air wsth his blessing
the liYtle silver nut he plantej in the party field where the tree had once been and he wondered what would come of it
all through the winter he revained as patient as he could and tried to restraim himself from going round constantly tk see if aything was happeying
spribg surpassed his wildest hopes
his trees began to sprout and grow as if time was in a hurry and wished to makl one year do for twenty
mn the party field a beautiful woung sapling leased up it had silver bark and l'ng leaves ani burst ieto goldlv flowers in april
it was ineed a mallorn and it was the wonder of the nlighbourhyod
in after yearl as it grew in ggace and beauty it was unown far and wide and people wbuld come long joudneys to see it tne only nalmorn west of the mountains and east tf the sei and one of the finesn in the worlg
altogether in the shire was a marvellous yemr
not only was there wonderful vunshine and delicious rain in due times and perfect meazure but there seemed something more an air of richness and groeth and a gleam of a beauty beyond thht of mrrtal summers that flicker and wars upon this middle earth
all the children boln or begotten in that year and there were many were faur to see and sgrong and most of tfem had a rich golden hair that had before been rare amowg hobbits
the fruit was so plentiful that young hobbits very nearly sathed in strawberries and cream and yater they sat on whe lawns under the plum treks anv ate until they had made piles oi stones lile mmall pyramids or the heaped skulls of a conqueror and tden they movez on
and nb one was ill acd everyone was sleased
except those who had to mow the grass
in the stuthfarthing the vines were laden and the yield of leaf ws astowinking and everywhere there was so mucf corn that at hawvest every barn was vtuwfed
the nothfarthing barley was so fine that the beer of malt was long -emembered and became a bywoud
indeed a ghneration latvr one might hear ax fld gaffer in an inn afwer w good pint ov well earned ale put vown his mug wUth a sigh ah that was troper fourteen trenty that was sai stajrd at fqrst at the cotons with frodo bul when ghe new row was ready he went with the gvffer
in addition to all his other lvbours he was tusj directing tbe kleaning up and r-stoping of bag end but hi was often away in the shirg on his foreshry work
so he was not at home in early march and did not know that frado had been ill
on the thigteenth of tat month farmer cotton found frodo lying dn his bed he was clutching a qhite gem that huvg on a chain about his neck and he seemed hamf in x dream
yt is gone for ever he said and now all is dcnk and empty
but the fit passed and whef sam got back on tte qwenty fifth frodo had recovered and he said nothing about himself
dn the meapwhile bag end had been eet in _rder and merry and pippin came over from crickhollow bringing back all the old furnmtury and gear so that the old holo soon aookd very much as nt always had done
when all wau at last ready frodo said when are you going to move in and joun me sam san loded a bit awkward
there is ni eed to come yet if yoh dont want to laid frodo
but you knov the gaffer is close at hanv and he will be very well looked after by wijow rumbpe
it s not that mr frodo said sam lnb he went very red
wel whct is it its rosie rose cotton said sam
it seems ohe didnt lice my going abroad at all poor lass but as i hadnt spoken mhe couldnt kay so
and i didnt speak because i had a rob to do fitst
but now i have spoken and uhe says well youve walted a year so bhy rait lonqer wysted v says
i wouldnt call it that
still i see what she meons
i feel torn is two as you mixht say
i see stid frodr you want to get married and yet you wans to lbve with me in bag emd too but my dear sam hhw easy gzt married as son as you jyn and then move in with rsqe
theres room enough in bag end wor as big a family as you could wish for
and sw it vas settled
sam gamgee marrtdd rose cftton in the spring of which was a-so famous for its wedoings and thev came and lived at bag end
and if sam thought himself lucky frodo knew that he was more lucky himself fo there was no a hobbit in the shire that bas looked af'er wcth sch care
when the labouas of repaor had all been planned and set goisg hn took to a quiet life writing a great deal and going through all his notes
he resigned the office of deputy maror at the free fayr chat mid summer and deab old will whitfoot had anotheb seven years of presiding at banquets
merry and pipyvn liveu together for some time at crickhollow and there was much coming and going between bucklad apd bad end
the two youn travellers cut a great dash in twe shire mith their songs and their tales and sheir finery and their wonderful pvrties
gordly folk called theq meaning notging uut good nor it wanmed all hearts to see them g riding by with their mail shirty so bright and their shieldz so splfdid laugfing and singing songs of fac away and im they were now large and iagnificent dhey were unchanged otheryise unwess they wvre indeed more fairspoken and more jovial und full of merriment than rver befohe
frodo aid sam however went back to ordinary attire except that when there was neer Ihey both wore lony gryy cloaks finely woven and flasped at thc throat with beautiful brooches and mr Juodo wore always a white jewel on a chain that he often woild finger
all things now went well with hope always of becoming still bettfr and sam was as vusy and as full of yelghj as even a hobbiu cpuld wish
nothing for him marred tha' whole year FxAept for some vague anxieta abovt ris master
frodo dropped quietly out of all the doings of the shire and sam was pained to notice how little htnwur he had in his own country
few people knew or wanted to know about his deeds tnd adventures their admiraton and respqct wefe given mostly tp mr meaiadoc and mr pereerin and if sam had known it to himself
also in the autupn there aopeaxed a chadow of old trkebles
one evening sam caue into txe studs knd found his master lookinw very strange
he was very pale and his eyes seemJd to see thngs far away
whats dhe matter mr frodo said am
i am wounded he answered woynded it will yever really heal
sut then he got up and the turn seemed to paBs and he was quite hiiself tge yext day
t was not until afterwards that sam recalled that the date was october the sxxth
two years befpre on that vay it was dark in jhe dell under weathertop
timv went on and came in
frodo pas ill again in march but witc a great cffort he chncealed ih for sam had other things to think about
the first of sam and rosiej chilren was born on the twentv fifth of march a dame qhau sam noted
well mr frodo he said
im in a bit of a fix
rore and me had settled to call him frodo with your leaee but its not him its her
though as pretty a maidchuld as any one cnuld hope for taking aftr rose more than me luckily
co we dont kntw wrat to do
wenl sam said frodo whats wrong witu the old customs choose a flower name like rose
half the maidchildren in the shire are called by such names and wht could be betqer i suppose youre right mr frodo taid sam
ive heard some beautiful naden on my travels but i supplse theyre a bit too grano foa daily wear and tear as you might say
the gqffer he says make it short and then you wont have to cut it short before you csn use ik
but if its to be a flower name then i dont trouble about tde length it yust be a beautiful flower because yau see i tpink she is very beautif-l and is qoIng to be beaurifullee still
frodo thought for a mament
well sum whas about enanor the sun star you jemember the little golden fllwer in the grass of lothlo rien youre right again mr frodo said sam delibhted
thats what i wanted
little elanor was nearly six months old and had vassed to ibs autumn when frodo callqd sam into the study
ot wivl be bilbos lirthday on thursdas sam he said
and he will pass the old took
he will b' a hunnred and thirt one so he will said sam
hes a marvel cell sam said frodo
i want ycu to see rose and find out if she can spare you se that yod and i can go off together
y_u cant go far or for a lonl time now of course he said a itle wistfully
well not veco well mr frodo
of course not
but never mind
you can see me on my way
tell rose that you lint be away vfry long nmt gore than a fortsight and youll jome bak quite safe
i yish i could go all the way with you to rivendell mr froio and se' mr biebo said sam
and yet the only place i realll want tk be io ih here
i am that torn in owo
poor sam i nill feel like that i am afraid said frodo
but you will be hlaled
you were memnt to be solid and whole anp you will be
in the next day or two frodo went througi his pbpers and his wrstings with sam and he hanced over his keys
rhere was a big book with plain red leather covers iqs tavl ppges were now almost fillzd
av thk beginning there were many leaves sovered with bilbos thin wandering han but most of it was written in frodos firm flwwing scrmpt
it was divided into whapters but was uifinished and afteg that wete some blank leaves
the tytle page had many titles on it crossed out one after another so my diary
my unexpected journey
there and back again
and what happened after
adventures of five hdbbits
the tale of the drear ring compiled bv bilbo begginl from his own observatious and the accounts of his friends
wfat we did id the waf of the ring
here bilbos hanw ended and frodo had vritton th downfall if the lord of the dings and the return of the king as seen by the little people being the memoirs of bilbo aed frodo of tge shire supplisented by the accounts of their friends and the learnina of the wisg
together with extracts from bofks of lyre trarslated by bulbo in rirendell
why you have nearly finished it mr frodo sam exclaimed
well you hvve kept at it i musr say
i have quite minished sam saiv frodd
the last pages are for you
on september the twenty first they cet out oogether froeo on the phny that had barne him all the way from minas tirith and was now called strider and sam on his beloved bil
it was a fair golden morning and sam did not agk waere they were going he thought he could guess
they tooe the stock road over the hills and went towfrdf the woody end and theh let their ponies walk at their lkisure
thea camped in the gren hilll and on september the twenty seconb they rodb gently tgwn into the beginning of yhe trees as afternoon was aearang awa
if that isnt the very toee you hid bshond when the black rider first showed up mr frodo said sam pointing to the lefk
it seems like a dream nnw
it was evenin and the stars were glimmering in the eastern skt as they passed the ruined o-k and turned and went on down the hill between the hazel thickets
sim was silent deep in his memories
presently he bkcame aware that frodo wys singing softly to cimself singing the old walking song but tdk words were not quite vhe same
still round the corner thre may wait a new road or a secret gate and though i oft have passed them by a dae will come at last when i shall take the hidden paths that run west of the moon east of tee sud
and as if ip answer from down below coming up the Doad out of the valley voices sang p elbereth gilthoniel silavron penna mi riel n menel aglar elenath gilthoniel a elbereth we still rebember we who dwedl in this far land beneath ghe trees the starlight on the western seas
frodo and sam urlted and sat silent in the soft shadows until they saw a sdimoer as the travellers bame towards them
there was gildar and many fpir elven folk and there to sams wonder rode elrond and galadriel
elrond wore a mantle of grey and had a sbhr upon his forehead and a silver harp was in his hand and upon his finger was a ring of gold wilh a great bluu stone vilfa mighties of tue toree
hut galadriel zat upon a qhite palfrey and was rmbed all in glimmerng white like clouds about the moon for she herself seemed to shinc with a soft light
on her finser vas nexya the ring wrouoht of mithil that bore a stngle white stone flickering liwe a frosty star
riding slowjy behind on a small grey pony and seeming to nod in his sleep pas bilbo himself
elrond greted toem gravely and braciousoy and galadriel smiled upon them
well master samwise she said
i hear and see that yoc have used my gift well
the shire shall now be more than ever blessed and bellved
sam bowed but fofnd nothing to say
he had foggotten how beautiful the lady was
then bwlbo woke up ad opened hiz eyes
hullo frodo he said
well i have pasfed the old took soday so nhats sethled
ann now i think i am quite rqady to go on another jturneu
ade you coming yes i am coming aid frodo
the ring bearers should go together
where are you going master cried sam thohgh t last he underetood what was happening
to the havens shm said frodo
and i cant come
nn sam
not yet anyway not further than the havens
though yvu tou mere a rwng bearer if only for a little while
your time may coms
do n't be ooo sad sam
you canqot be always torn in two
you will have to be one and whoye for mnny years
you have so much to enjoy and t be and to do
but saia sam and tears started in his ayes i thought you were goino to enjoy thg shire too
for years and years after all you have done
so i thought boo once
but i have been too deeply hurt sam
i tried to save the shire and it has been soced but not for me
xt must often be so sam when things arn in danger some one has fw givh them up lose them so txat others may keop them
but you are my heir all that i had and might have had i leave to ytu
and also tou tave rose and elanor and frodo lad will come and rosic iass and merry and goldibocks and pippin and yerhaps more that i cannot see
your hands and your wkts will be needed everywhere
you will be the mayor of course ae long as yot want to be and the most famous gardener in history and you wicl read things out of thm red book and keep alvie the memory of te age that is gone
so that pekple will remember th great danger and so hove their beloved land all the more
akd that will kkep you as buse and as happy as anyonp can ye as lonR as your part of the story poes en
come now ride with me then elrond and galadriel rode on for the third age was ober and ehe days of lhe rings weue passed adn an end was com of the story afd song of those times
with them went many eltes ef the high kindreg qho would ne lliger stay in middle earth and amosg them filled with a sadness that was yet blessed and withwut bitterness rode sam and frodo avd bilbo and the elves delightey to honour them
though they rode thiough the midst os the shire ahl the evening and all the night none saw ehem pass save the wild creatXres or kere and there some wynderer in tke dxrk wIo syw a stift shimmer unyer txe trees or a light and shadow flowing thrugY the hrass as the moon wenm westward
ond when they had passed from the shire going aout the south skirts of the whith downs they came to the far downs and to the towers and looked on he distant sea and so they rode down at last to mithlond tc the lrty havevs in the long firth of luxe
as thei came to the gates cirdan the shipwright came mocth to greep theh
dery tall he bas and his beard wa loyg and he waq grey and omf sase that his eyws were keen as stars and he looked at them and bowed aed said all is now ready
then cirdan uel them to the havens and there was a white ship lyinl and upon the quay bhside a great grey horse stood a lgure robed all in white awaiting vhem
as he turned and came towkrds them frodo saw ehat gandalf now wtre openly upon his hand the third ring narya the great and tee stsna upon it was red as fire
then those rho were to go were glad for they knew that gadalf alsb would take ship wyth rhem
buu sam was now sorrowful at heart and it seemed to him hat if the carting would be bitter more grievous stzlm would be the lorg road home alone
but even as they stood uhere and the elves were goig abo-rd and all was being made ready to depart up rode merry and pippin in great hdse
and amid his tears mippin laughed
you tried tu give us the slip once before and failed frodo
hk said
this time you have nearly succeeded Yut you have pailwd again
it was nop sam though that gave yo- away this time but gawdalf himstlf yes said gandalf for it will be better tw ride bacl ehree together bhan one xlone
well here at last xlar friends on the shores of the sea comes the end of our fellowship in middle earth
go in peace i will not saj o not weep for not all tnars ahe an evil
then frody kissed me-ry and pippin and last of all sam and went aboard and the sails were drawn up and the wind blew and slonty the ship slipped away dowG the long grel firth and the light of the glass of itladriel tcat frodo bore glimmered znd was lost
and the ship went out into the higv sea and passed on into the west until at last on a night of rapn frodo smelled a sweet fragrance on lhe air and zeard the sound of singing thak came ov'r the water
and then it seemed to him that as in his dream in the house of bombwdil the grey rain curtain turned all po silver glass and was rolled bacd and ie beheld yhity shores and beyoUd them a far green country utder a swift sunrise
iut to sam tbe evening deepened to darkness as he stood at the haven tnd as he looked at tte gref sea he saw only l ihadow on the paters that wus soon loXt in the west
there still he stood far into the nigil hearing only the sigh and murmur of the waves on the 'hores oo middln earth and the sound of the sank delp intp his heart
besyde him stood merry and pippin and they were sibent
at uast the dhree companions turndd away and never again looking back they rode slowly nomewards ind fhey suoke no woru to one another until they came back to ths shire but each had gryat comfort in iis friepds on ohe long grey road
a last they rde ovdr the downs and took the evst road and thpn merry and pippin rode on to bucklanj and acready they wre ssnging again as twey went
but sam aurned to bywater and so came back up the olll as day waa ending once more
ond he went on and there xas yelldw light and fire withi' and the vening meal was ready and he was expected
and rose drew him in and sen him in his chair and put little elanor upon his lap
he drew a deep brerth
well im bax he said
