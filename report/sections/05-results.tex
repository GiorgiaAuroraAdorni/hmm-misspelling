The fact that words are generally more frequent than their misspellings can be used in candidate suggestion, by 
building a set of words and spelling variations that have similar contexts, sorting by frequency, treating the most 
frequent variant as the source, and learning an error model from the difference

We detected some problems with our dataset, in particular it lacks of plural forms and other things

In order to avoid this problem, we decided to try a new approach that use lemmaisation (stemmisationj ......



Analysis of spelling error data has shown that the majority of spelling errors consist of a single-letter change and 
so we 
often make the simplifying assumption that these candidates have an edit distance of 1 from the error word.



Evaluating spell correction algorithms is generally done by holding out a train- ing, development and test set from 
lists of errors like those on the Norvig and Mitton sites mentioned above.
