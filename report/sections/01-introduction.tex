In recent decades, technology has had a strong impact on everyone's life. It plays an important role in the 
communication process, simplifying different activities for both individuals and businesses.

Nowadays we have advanced communication tools available, such as smartphones, tablets and computers that have 
simplified the way humans communicate. \\
Companies can write an e-mail and deliver it to all their consumers in a few minutes. \\
People can message their friends at every moment and share an interest with new friends from different countries.

This advancement in communication technology has made it necessary to equip our technological tools with a series of 
programs and software that control and correct automatically the misspelt words typed.

In this project, we propose and evaluate an automatic spelling correction algorithm, modelling the typing process as an 
\textit{Hidden Markov Model} (HMM).
