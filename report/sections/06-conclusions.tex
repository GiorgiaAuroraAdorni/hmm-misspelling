\section{Future Works}

- update the various dataset: in particular we can use a new frequency dataset consistent with the language model one.\\
- Compute the initial probabilities $\pi$ from the language model\\
- Consider additional type of error in the model\\
- improving the noisy channel error model to consider neighbouring characters
- Use other algorithms, such as the forward-backward (smooothing) instead Viterbi\\
- Optimise the code, in particular the lemmatisation/stemming \\
- Use recurrent neural network instead the hidden markov models.\\
